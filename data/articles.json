        "title": "Car AC Blowing Hot Air",
        "content": "Understanding the Causes\n\nA quick understanding of how air conditioning works can help with understanding what the causes could be. When AC is turned on, refrigerant that flows through the system absorbs heat from your vehicle\u2019s cabin where it\u2019s removed and, through a series of parts and processes, the heat is released into the atmosphere before circulating back and repeating the process. There are several points where something can be wrong, causing warm air rather than cool:\n\nThere isn\u2019t sufficient airflow in the cabin. This could be a problem with a bad blower motor, but more commonly a plugged cabin air filter is the culprit.\nThere isn\u2019t enough refrigerant. The gas that circulates through the system can leak out, preventing it from working efficiently.\nThe compressor may not be cycling. A clutch issue or a compressor failure can prevent the AC system from being able to disperse the heat the refrigerant has absorbed.\nThe expansion valve is clogged. A blockage in the expansion valve could mean cooled refrigerant can\u2019t circulate back to the cabin.\nThe radiator is blocked. Debris blocking the condenser, mounted behind the radiator, could make it impossible for the heated refrigerant to cool effectively.\nThere\u2019s an electrical issue. A number of electrical connections could be loose or damaged, or a part like the HVAC control may not be working well.\n\nIf the air from the vents is blowing cool but not cold air, the airflow is weak, the vent temperature goes from hot to cold frequently, or you\u2019re only getting warm air from the vents, it\u2019s time to give your AC some attention.\n\nDIY Diagnosis and Quick Fixes\n\nMany AC problems can be identified on your own, and some can be remedied with a quick fix.\n\nFirst, check the cabin air filter condition and replace it if it\u2019s dirty or clogged.\nCheck that the heater fan is blowing. If it\u2019s only blowing on high speed, the blower motor resistor might be faulty or a fuse might be blown.\nClean off the radiator. If it\u2019s plugged with debris like leaves, dirt, and bugs, wash it off to allow air to pass through it and the condenser.\nCheck all the wiring connections for the AC system that you can access. There might be a loose connection at the AC compressor, for example. Check along the wires for rubs or cuts.\nCheck the refrigerant level and top it up. Using a DIY refrigerant kit with a gauge, determine if the system is full or below full. Top up the refrigerant level according to the product\u2019s instructions and check the vent temperatures again.\n\nRoutine Maintenance Tips\n\nRoutine maintenance is essential to ensure your car\u2019s air conditioning system continues to blow cool air, especially during warmer months. A simple yet effective maintenance step is routinely checking and replacing the cabin air filter. A dirty or clogged filter can restrict airflow and reduce the system\u2019s effectiveness.\nHaving your air conditioning system professionally inspected at least once a year can help identify potential issues before they lead to significant damage or inefficiency. This inspection should include checking the refrigerant levels and ensuring there are no leaks in the system. Regularly running the AC, even during cooler months, can also prevent seals from drying out and cracking, which can lead to leaks.\nFurthermore, keeping the car\u2019s radiator and condenser clean can prevent overheating and ensure the AC runs efficiently.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nIf your DIY diagnosis doesn\u2019t reveal the problem or you aren\u2019t able to conclusively find what\u2019s causing the problem, get a professional involved. It\u2019s easy to spend a small fortune replacing parts as a guess, and you might still require a visit to the mechanic to get it fixed.\nWhen you\u2019re looking for a repair shop to take your car to, ensure that they have professional-grade equipment to perform AC repairs. Because R134a refrigerant is a controlled material, their technicians need to be certified to recover and recharge your system.\n\nPreventative Measures for a Cool Ride\n\nTo help avoid AC system problems, keep your engine bay clean, preventing dirt from accumulating on the condenser. As well, make a cabin air filter replacement an annual task right before summer arrives.\nDuring winter months, use your AC to help defrost the windshield and condition your cabin more effectively. Along with being effective, it can also help you identify if there are issues that need to be addressed before it gets hot outside.

        "title": "Does the Car AC Use Gas?",
        "content": "Introduction to Car AC and Heating Systems\n\nTo understand how air conditioning and heating in a car affect gas usage, it\u2019s essential to know the basics of how these systems operate. The car\u2019s AC system functions by compressing refrigerant and passing it through an expansion valve, which causes it to cool down. A fan then blows air over the cooled refrigerant through the evaporator, thus providing refreshing, chilled air within the vehicle\u2019s cabin. The compressor is spun by an AC or serpentine belt, driven by the crankshaft, but when it\u2019s not in use, the compressor disconnects using a clutch on the pulley.\nHeating in a vehicle, on the other hand, typically uses the heat generated from the car\u2019s engine that would otherwise be wasted. The coolant absorbs this heat, and as it circulates through the heater core, a fan blows the warm air produced into the cabin, providing the warmth you feel.\n\nAC Usage\u2019s Effect on Gas Consumption\n\nSo, does turning on the AC actually use more gas? The short answer is yes. When you switch on your car\u2019s AC, it puts an additional load on the engine because the compressor needs power to run, and this power comes from the engine itself. The energy to drive the AC compressor is typically generated by burning fuel, meaning that when your AC is running, your vehicle is consuming slightly more gas than when it\u2019s off.\nBut how significant is this impact on fuel consumption? Studies suggest that using the car\u2019s AC can reduce fuel economy by roughly three to ten percent, varying based on factors such as the condition of the vehicle, the efficiency of the AC system, the exterior temperature, and the settings used.\n\nHeater Usage\u2019s Effect on Gas Consumption\n\nWhat about the car heater? Does the heater use gas in the same way the AC does? Since the heater typically utilizes waste heat from the engine to warm the vehicle, it does not require the same amount of direct energy as the air conditioner does. This means that the heater has a much less significant impact on fuel consumption compared to the AC. However, certain heater-related features, like rear window defrost or higher blower motor fan speeds, may consume more power that the alternator needs to generate and as a result, more fuel.\n\nTips for Optimal Fuel Efficiency for AC Use\n\nUnderstanding the impact of AC and heater usage on fuel consumption is one thing, but what practical steps can you take to ensure your car remains as fuel-efficient as possible while still enjoying the benefits of climate control? Here are some tips:\n\nOnly use the AC when necessary, and try to start on lower settings, gradually increasing as needed.\u00a0\nKeep your AC system well-maintained. This includes checking for leaks and ensuring that the refrigerant levels are topped up every three to five years.\nWhenever possible, park in the shade or use a sunshade. This simple action can keep your car cooler when parked, reducing the need to blast the AC on high for extended periods.\nAt lower speeds such as when you\u2019re driving under 55 miles per hour, it can be more fuel-efficient to roll down the windows, as the drag caused by open windows at high speeds makes your engine work harder.\nUse the recirculation feature of your AC during the hottest parts of the day. This circulates the already cooled air inside your car instead of pulling in hotter air from outside.\nDon\u2019t turn the fan speed on high. You\u2019ll actually get the cabin cooler in the summer when you turn the fan speed down a notch.\n\nBy following these strategies, you can keep your car cool or warm without significantly affecting your gas mileage. Being mindful of how and when you use your car\u2019s AC and heater not only saves you gas and money but also helps reduce your environmental impact.\nUnderstanding the relationship between your car\u2019s climate control systems and fuel consumption gives you the control to manage your vehicle\u2019s efficiency better. So, next time you reach for the temperature controls, remember that while both the AC and heater do use gas, the impact varies considerably between the two systems.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Use Car Defrosters",
        "content": "Types of Car Defrosters: Rear and Front Defrosters\n\nCar defrosters are found in two main places. The front is meant to defrost or defog your front windshield and the side windows, and the rear defrosters is intended to clear the back glass. Both serve the same purpose but are designed for different parts of the vehicle.\n\nRear defrosters are primarily responsible for clearing the rear windshield of frost, ice, and condensation. They consist of heating elements embedded in the glass, which radiate heat to melt away any obstructions. It\u2019s triggered by hitting the defrost switch or button on the HVAC controls.\nFront defrosters are essential for maintaining visibility through the front windshield. They work by blowing air, usually warm air, onto the glass surface to remove fog and ice buildup. It\u2019s activated when the heater control air direction is switched to defrost setting, whether it\u2019s only defrost or a blend with floor or dash vents too.\n\nHow to Use Car Defrosters: Step-by-Step Guide\n\nYou might think it\u2019s a no-brainer to use the defroster on your car. But in reality, it\u2019s an often misused system. You might be using it when it isn\u2019t necessary, or you might not be using it when you should.\nTo effectively use your car defroster, follow these simple steps.\n\n1. Activating the Defroster\n\nWhen you first notice your windshield or rear window fogging or frosting up, the defroster should be activated right away. The engine should be started, otherwise there might not be power to the rear defrost grid or there may not be any heat blowing from the front. The defroster controls on your dashboard are usually marked with a snowflake or windshield icon accompanied by wavy lines signifying heat.\nTurn on the defroster system by pressing the appropriate button or dial. The rear defroster is timed, and will often kick off after around 10 minutes.\n\n2. Setting the Right Temperature and Fan Speed\n\nAdjust the temperature to a warm setting, and typically, the hotter the better for clearing the windows. There is a bit of a balance to keep in mind in winter weather as high heat on the windshield can cause more moisture or snow accumulation.\nSet the fan to medium or high for the best results, pushing air over the glass to get rid of the moisture.\n\n3. Defrosting the Rear Windshield (If Applicable)\n\nIf your vehicle has a rear defroster \u2013 and most vehicles do \u2013 activate it separately using the rear defroster switch. As an added bonus, it usually turns on the heated outside mirrors, if your vehicle is equipped with them.\nEnsure the rear defroster light or indicator is illuminated, indicating that it\u2019s operational. It will turn off after it\u2019s been on for about 10 minutes or so.\n\n4. Use Air Conditioning\n\nTo dehumidify the interior and prevent condensation, switch on your air conditioning system in combination with the defroster. For most vehicles, it automatically comes on when the defrost is engaged, but some drivers might not understand that it helps to remove the moisture from the air, and they turn it off. While the defrost might still work, it\u2019s more effective with the A/C on.\n\nTips for Quick Defrosting\n\nFor rapid defrosting and improved visibility, consider these tips:\n\nPark your car in a garage or sheltered area whenever possible.\nUse an ice scraper or defrosting spray for stubborn ice buildup on the outside of the glass.\nAvoid using hot water, as it can crack your windshield.\nKeep your windows and sunroof closed to reduce cold air infiltration.\nUse the defrost setting on humid days to prevent moisture buildup inside your car.\n\nPrecautions and Safety Measures\n\nWhile using your car defroster, never leave your vehicle unattended. You\u2019ll have the engine running, and defrosting a car is a major contributor to easy car thefts with the keys already present.\nAlso, don\u2019t obstruct the defroster vents with objects or debris. Not only can items fall into the vents, but it seriously reduces how effective it will clear your windows.\nLastly, be cautious when using the defroster in confined spaces to prevent carbon monoxide buildup.\n\nMaintaining and Cleaning Car Defrosters\n\nTo maintain your defroster system\u2019s efficiency, perform regular cleaning and checks. Clean the defroster vents and windshield regularly to remove dust and debris, and inspect the heating elements for damage or signs of wear. Notice a problem? Replace damaged or malfunctioning defroster components promptly.\n\nSeasonal Preparation: Winterizing Your Car Defrosters\n\nBefore the winter season, take these steps to prepare your car defrosters:\n\nCheck all defroster components for proper function.\nReplace your cabin air filter annually to promote good airflow.\nTop up your windshield washer fluid with a winter-grade solution.\nKeep spare fuses and a defroster repair kit in your vehicle.\n\nCommon Defroster Problems and Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with your car defroster, it might have a simple solution. Here are a few scenarios:\n\nIf you have weak or no heat output, check coolant levels and the thermostat, and replace if necessary.\nIf you have rear defroster grid damage, use a repair kit or consult a glass repair shop for repairs.\nIf your front defroster isn\u2019t blowing air, it could be a blower motor or resistor issue. It\u2019ll need to be diagnosed for the correct repair to perform.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Does AC Affect Gas Mileage?",
        "content": "How Air Conditioning Affects Fuel Consumption\n\nTo comprehend the impact of AC on gas mileage, it\u2019s essential to first grasp how the A/C system functions. In simple terms, the AC system relies on a compressor to pressurize and circulate a refrigerant that absorbs heat from inside the vehicle and expels it outside. This process cools the cabin, making your drive more comfortable during hot weather. However, operating the A/C system does require energy, and that energy comes from your vehicle\u2019s engine.\nWhen you turn on the AC, the engine works harder to power the compressor and maintain the temperature inside the cabin. The increased workload results in higher fuel consumption, at least in theory. The engine\u2019s fuel efficiency is influenced by various factors, including load and engine speed, and AC usage directly impacts these variables.\nIn general, the impact of AC on fuel consumption is more significant in city driving conditions compared to highway driving. In stop-and-go traffic, where the engine frequently revs up and down, the A/C system\u2019s demand for power becomes noticeable. On the open highway, the impact is relatively less pronounced as the engine operates at a more consistent speed.\n\nUnderstanding Gas Mileage and Efficiency\n\nTo understand the AC\u2019s effect on gas mileage, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the concept of gas mileage and efficiency. Gas mileage, expressed as miles per gallon (MPG), indicates how many miles a vehicle can travel on a gallon of fuel. The higher the MPG, the more fuel-efficient the vehicle is.\nEfficiency is a complex interplay of various factors, including the vehicle\u2019s engine, weight, and driving conditions. AC usage is one of these factors, but it\u2019s not the only one influencing gas mileage. Factors like tire pressure, vehicle maintenance, and driving habits also play significant roles in determining fuel efficiency. Overall, A/C might decrease your fuel mileage by up to 25%, and that becomes noticeable at the pump. You\u2019ll want to figure out how to reduce the effect when possible.\n\nTips for Improving Gas Mileage While Using A/C\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that AC usage can affect fuel consumption let\u2019s explore some practical tips to help you maintain a balance between comfort and fuel economy:\n\nUse A/C wisely. On the highway, consider using the A/C sparingly or turning it off when cruising at a constant speed. In stop-and-go traffic or during extreme heat, use the A/C strategically to stay comfortable without overtaxing your engine.\nKeep windows closed. When driving at high speeds on the highway, keeping your windows closed reduces aerodynamic drag, which can improve fuel efficiency.\nPark in the shade. Parking in the shade helps keep your car cooler, reducing the need for intense A/C use when you start your journey.\nMaintain your vehicle. Keep your vehicle well-maintained with routine oil and oil filter changes, air filter replacements, and tire rotations. A well-maintained engine runs more efficiently, which can offset some of the A/C-related fuel consumption.\nMaintain proper tire pressure. Ensure your tires are properly inflated. Underinflated tires can increase rolling resistance and decrease fuel efficiency.\n\nSeasonal Considerations: AC Usage in Different Weather\n\nAC usage may vary depending on the season. During hot summer months, it\u2019s natural to rely more on AC to stay cool. However, during the fall and spring, you might have more flexibility to use natural ventilation and reduce AC usage.\nIn the winter, you might not think you\u2019re using the AC at all, but you are. When the windshield is defrosting, the air conditioning cycles to remove moisture from your interior that causes the frost. Still, whenever possible, switch to another setting that doesn\u2019t use AC to remove the drain on the system.\n\nHybrid and Electric Cars: AC Impact on Range\n\nFor hybrid and electric vehicle owners, AC usage can have a slightly different impact. EVs use the high-voltage battery to power the AC, which can lead to a reduction in the vehicle\u2019s range. To mitigate this, some EVs offer features like preconditioning, allowing you to cool or heat the cabin while the vehicle is still connected to a charger.\nHybrid vehicles also see a decrease in fuel efficiency when running the AC, but the impact is typically less significant compared to traditional gasoline vehicles.\n\nBalancing Comfort and Fuel Economy\n\nSo, does AC burn gas more than you expect? While it\u2019s true that using the AC can impact gas mileage, the effect is manageable with mindful driving habits and vehicle maintenance. The key is to strike a balance between staying comfortable and maximizing fuel efficiency. By using the AC strategically, maintaining your vehicle, and considering seasonal variations, you can enjoy a comfortable ride without breaking the bank at the gas pump.\nRemember that modern vehicles are designed to be more fuel-efficient than ever, and advancements in AC technology continue to improve energy efficiency. So, whether you\u2019re cruising through the sweltering summer heat or embarking on a long road trip, rest assured that you can enjoy a cool, comfortable ride without sacrificing too much in terms of gas mileage.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Make Your Car AC Colder",
        "content": "Basic Maintenance for Improved Cooling\n\nKeeping up with your car\u2019s maintenance will even contribute to keeping the AC blowing as cold as it possibly can. Routine car washes can promote better AC operation when you blow the dirt and bugs out of the AC condenser, helping to transfer heat from the refrigerant into the ambient air.\nIf the serpentine belt (or AC belt, if there\u2019s a dedicated belt) is stretched or badly cracked, it could be slipping on the AC compressor clutch pulley and it could be working subpar as a result. A routine inspection can find issues like a bad belt so it can be replaced.\n\nOptimizing Airflow and Temperature Control\n\nIf you\u2019ve got your blower motor cranked and the temperature on full cold, you still might not be getting the best cooling performance from your AC. It\u2019ll reach its coldest if you:\n\nHave the fan set one notch down from full blast\nTurn the temperature all the way to cold\nSet the air direction to feet and dash vents\nHave the recirculate mode on\n\nRather than drawing in warm air from outside, it keeps circulating the cooled air from the cabin, making it even colder.\n\nChecking and Replacing Cabin Air Filters\n\nIf it feels like the airflow from your vents isn\u2019t strong enough, it could be due to a dirty or clogged cabin air filter. Buildup of any airborne particles can get captured and, with enough debris stuck in the filter media, air doesn\u2019t pass through it easily anymore. Often located behind the glove box, the cabin air filter is easily changed, and if it\u2019s plugged up, your airflow should be restored as soon as the new one is installed.\n\nRefrigerant Levels and Recharging\n\nInsulating and Reflecting Heat\n\nIf your efforts to optimize AC performance aren\u2019t successful to this point, then other solutions might be beneficial. Since the cabin can become a broiler in under an hour when the temperature is only 75 degrees, windshield sunshades are a great way to keep your car cooler than the outside air \u2013 or, at least, not as hot as it could be. They insulate the car from the UV rays that cause it to bake inside, and the reflective material sends the rays back outside.\n\nUpgrading Your Car\u2019s AC System\n\nThere may actually be a leak in the AC system somewhere. It could be a simple seal or a pinhole in the high-side or low-side line, or it could be a major component like an evaporator, compressor, condenser, or receiver-drier. If that\u2019s the case, a recharge will only work for a short time, and a repeat of the same problem will indicate you need a repair. Unfortunately, these types of repairs can be costly, but with any luck, it will be an infrequent occurrence.\n\nProfessional Assistance and Expert Advice\n\nIf you haven\u2019t had any success improving your car\u2019s AC cooling capabilities or you need to find a leak, then a professional is the best bet. As well as being accredited for handling refrigerant safely and legally, a certified mechanic can save you time to diagnose the problem and fix it. Sometimes, the labor charges are worthwhile to be able to enjoy your car from the driver\u2019s seat again.\nNeed AC parts or advice on cooling your car?

        "title": "Signs Your Car\u2019s AC Needs to be Recharged",
        "content": "Understanding the Importance of AC Recharge\n\nRefrigerant cycles through the air conditioning system to transfer heat from the cabin to the engine bay where it can be dissipated into the atmosphere. When the system is full, the low-pressure refrigerant passing through the evaporator inside the car absorbs heat to make the air feel cooler. But if the AC refrigerant charge is low, the refrigerant doesn\u2019t get as cool as it should, and the compressor needs to work overtime to push refrigerant into the high-pressure side.\nWhen that happens, there\u2019s additional strain on the compressor and it can fail prematurely or stop cycling. And with low charge, the AC doesn\u2019t function as well as it should inside your cabin either.\n\nSigns That Your Car\u2019s AC Needs to be Recharged\n\nThere are a handful of signs your AC needs to be recharged in your car. You may experience one or more of them, but it often depends on your climate and how your AC typically performs.\n\nAC isn\u2019t blowing cold air. Clearly, if there isn\u2019t cold air blowing from your dash vents, it can be a symptom of a system that\u2019s low on refrigerant. Don\u2019t rely on this symptom alone, though, since almost all AC issues will cause it.\nThe AC clutch doesn\u2019t engage. When the refrigerant is low, the compressor clutch may not engage at all, or it might only engage sporadically, like when you rev the engine.\nAC only cools when you\u2019re accelerating. Low charge can mean the compressor can\u2019t circulate refrigerant well at low engine speeds, but some cold air comes from the vents when you\u2019re driving.\u00a0\nThe windows won\u2019t clear. AC removes moisture from the cabin air on defrost settings. If your windows aren\u2019t clearing, odds are that the refrigerant is low.\nYou\u2019ve replaced AC components. When you open the AC\u2019s closed system, refrigerant escapes into the atmosphere and will need to be recharged.\n\nPotential Drawbacks and Limitations of DIY AC Recharge\n\nWhile you can recharge your AC at home, it\u2019s quite difficult to actually verify that there isn\u2019t a bigger problem that needs attention. If there\u2019s a leak, whether large or small, you could be adding refrigerant for it to quickly disappear again.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nAnd if there is a leak, vacuum testing should be done by someone certified to work on AC systems, who can also recover the remaining refrigerant from the system. If your car\u2019s AC loses its charge often, say more than once every three years, you should have a professional diagnose it, repair the problem, and recharge the system.",

        "content": "Introduction to A/C Compressors\n\nThe A/C compressor is responsible for compressing the refrigerant and circulating it throughout the system. Think of it as the heart of the A/C system. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nThe compressor takes in low-pressure cool refrigerant gas.\nAs the gas enters the compressor, its pressure and temperature increase significantly.\nThis now-hot gas moves to the condenser where it loses the heat and transforms into an extremely cold high-pressure liquid that absorbs heat from the cabin.\nThis liquid then passes through the expansion valve, turning back into a low-pressure gas, and the cycle starts over.\n\nImportance of a Properly Functioning A/C Compressor\n\nDriving in extremely hot summer temperatures is only bearable when your A/C is working. If the compressor isn\u2019t up to part, then your car gets hot inside, and you could even get sick from heat exhaustion.\nBut A/C does more than just cool your car\u2019s interior. It also removes moisture from the air inside, condensing it and draining it outside the car. It helps to eliminate fog that can obstruct your view as you drive in a rainstorm, and it can prevent or aid in dissipating frost when you need your car in the winter. In this way, it helps you drive safer \u2013 you\u2019re able to see properly.\n\nCommon Signs of a Bad A/C Compressor\n\nIf you have a bad A/C compressor, symptoms will eventually become evident. You\u2019ll find you have one or more of these common signs:\n\nUnusual noises and vibrations \u2013 worn bearings, shafts, and other internal parts can cause noises or shaking that transfer into the cabin.\nInsufficient cooling or uneven cooling \u2013 When there is a problem with the compressor, it may not be capable of maintaining the proper pressure or flow to cool the cabin.\nLeaking refrigerant \u2013 a hissing noise or bubbles detected when the compressor is sprayed with soapy water indicate the compressor is leaking refrigerant.\nExcessive cycling on and off \u2013 when the compressor is bad, whether it\u2019s from a bad clutch, a leak, or internal wear, it might cycle more frequently.\nUnpleasant odors \u2013 a sweet yet chemically smell might be detectible under the hood when the engine is running.\nIncreased fuel consumption \u2013 while it\u2019s likely minor, your car may burn more gas since you need to run the A/C more to keep up with vehicle cooling.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring a Bad A/C Compressor\n\nOf course, the most noticeable consequence of leaving your car\u2019s compressor unrepaired is that driving conditions are more uncomfortable. It gets more humid inside, plus the heat can be unbearable. But there are other consequences too:\n\nOther A/C parts can get damaged because the system has leaked out the refrigerant and oil, straining the system and starving it of lubricant.\nThe serpentine belt could break while you\u2019re driving, and that could lead to a loss of key systems like power steering.\nIt can increase repair costs significantly since additional repairs could be required.\nYour car is worth less than it could be if you decide to sell it.\n\nDIY Troubleshooting Tips\n\nNot sure if your A/C compressor is the problem? Here are a few tips to troubleshoot it on your own:\n\nCrank the A/C to max and check if it cools quickly. If not, it could be a compressor problem.\nListen and watch for the compressor clutch to cycle on and off. If it isn\u2019t stopping and starting back up, it could be a sign.\nListen for grinding noises or a whistling when the compressor cycles that could point to an internal problem.\nCheck for leaks with a UV light. If your system has been injected with a dye previously, you might detect traces of glowing dye at the compressor.\n\nSeeking Professional Assistance\n\nA/C systems are complex and often require professional diagnosis and repair. Not only is it easy to make a mistake on the process of an A/C compressor replacement, but refrigerant is highly regulated and should only be serviced by trained and certified professionals. Seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nIf you\u2019re considering a DIY repair for your compressor, you should have a shop evacuate it completely before disassembly. Then, after you\u2019ve completed the fix, they can vacuum test it, recharge the system, and verify its operation.\n\nPreventive Maintenance for A/C Compressors\n\nThere are a few ways to help keep bad A/C compressor symptoms at bay. The first is to use your air conditioning regularly. It\u2019s a myth that the A/C will fail sooner if you use it more, and there\u2019s no reason to compromise on safe, comfortable driving.\nAs well, have your A/C serviced every year. That can include checking for leaks, recharging the refrigerant, and inspecting the system\u2019s operation. And while it\u2019s often neglected, replace the desiccant material or receiver drier whenever an A/C component it replaced.",

        "title": "How to Replace an A/C Compressor",
        "content": "Introduction to A/C Compressor Replacement\n\nThe air conditioning compressor, or A/C compressor, serves as the heart of your vehicle\u2019s air conditioning system, playing a crucial role in cooling your car. It functions by circulating refrigerant necessary for heat exchange through the coils of the cabin\u2019s evaporator and the condenser in the engine bay.\nThe A/C compressor operates on a simple principle: it compresses the refrigerant gas, raising its temperature and pressure, and sends it through the system\u2019s condenser where it becomes a cool, low-pressure liquid. It then passes into the cabin where a fan blows over the cold evaporator, cooling the interior air while absorbing heat to move out of the cabin. This process is vital in keeping the interior of your car comfortable during hot weather.\nHowever, just like any other component in your vehicle, the A/C compressor can wear out over time due to factors such as age, mileage, or mechanical failure. When this happens, it\u2019s unable to perform its job effectively, leading to a less effective A/C system or even complete failure.\nIn such cases, replacing the A/C compressor becomes necessary to restore the cooling efficiency of your car to ensure not only your comfort but also your vehicle\u2019s A/C system performance.\n\nNecessary Tools and Safety Precautions\n\nChanging an A/C compressor requires a specific set of tools. Here\u2019s a list of what you might need:\n\nWrenches and sockets for removing and attaching bolts.\nScrewdrivers for various parts of the process.\nPliers for removing clips or clamps.\nA/C manifold gauge set to monitor the pressure of the A/C system.\nRefrigerant recovery machine that safely removes existing refrigerant from the system.\nVacuum pump to remove any air and moisture from the system.\nSafety glasses and gloves to protect your hands and eyes.\n\nAs for safety precautions:\n\nAlways wear safety glasses and gloves to protect yourself from injury.\n\nNever release refrigerant into the atmosphere. It\u2019s not only harmful to the environment but also illegal in many places. Use a refrigerant recovery machine to safely handle it.\n\nBe careful when working with the vehicle\u2019s electrical system. Disconnect the battery before starting work to avoid shocks.\n\nEnsure the vehicle is securely parked and cannot move or roll while you\u2019re working on it.\u00a0\n\nAlways follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions when installing the new compressor to ensure proper installation and operation.\n\nIt\u2019s not feasible to have a refrigerant recovery machine or a vacuum pump on hand in your garage unless you\u2019re a professional mechanic. So, consider having the system evacuated by your preferred shop before starting the repair, then have them recharge the system afterward too.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Replacing an A/C Compressor\n\nAgain, unless the system is empty, don\u2019t begin disassembling any parts that could release the refrigerant into the atmosphere. But once a mechanic has evacuated the system, it\u2019s safe to get started. Each vehicle has a nuanced process, but these are the general steps.\n\nStep 1: Remove the compressor belt. Locate the compressor belt on the front of the compressor and remove it. You may need to loosen other belts to access it.\nStep 2: Disconnect the electrical connector. Find the electrical connector on the compressor \u2013 it should have a wire leading into it. Then, carefully unplug it.\nStep 3: Disconnect the refrigerant lines. Using your wrenches, disconnect the refrigerant lines from the compressor. Remember to cap these lines to prevent contaminants from entering the system.\nStep 4: Remove the compressor. Now, you can remove the bolts that hold the compressor in place. Make sure to keep track of all bolts and where they came from for easier reassembly. Carefully lift the compressor out of the vehicle.\nStep 5: Install the new compressor. Place the new compressor in the same position as the old one. Reattach the bolts, connect the refrigerant lines, plug in the electrical connector, and reattach the compressor belt. Use new seals at each of the connections to avoid leaks.\n\nWith the system assembled, get your mechanic to vacuum test, recharge the system, with refrigerant, and confirm that it\u2019s operational.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\n\nReplacing an A/C compressor can come with a few common issues, and knowing how to handle these can make the process smoother. Here are some of those issues and their solutions:\n\nInsufficient cooling. After replacing the compressor, the A/C might not cool the car as expected. This could be due to improper vacuuming before recharging the refrigerant or a leak in the system. The solution is to check for leaks and ensure the system is properly vacuumed and recharged.\u00a0\nCompressor clutch not engaging. If the compressor clutch doesn\u2019t engage, it could be due to electrical issues or a faulty clutch. Check the wiring and fuses, and if they\u2019re fine, the clutch might need to be replaced.\nNoises after installation. Unusual noise after installation could indicate that the compressor was not installed correctly or there are loose mounting bolts. Recheck the installation and make sure all bolts are tightened correctly.\nRefrigerant leaks. This could be due to damaged seals or improper connections to the refrigerant lines. Inspect all seals and connections, and replace or tighten them as necessary.\n\nElectrical issues. If the compressor isn\u2019t getting power, the problem could be with the wiring, fuses, or relay. A thorough inspection of the electrical components can help identify and resolve the issue.\n\nAlways remember, if you\u2019re unsure about any part of the process, it\u2019s best to consult with a professional to avoid damaging your vehicle or hurting yourself.\n\nPotential Drawbacks and Limitations\n\nIt\u2019s not always advised to do the job yourself. With an A/C compressor, it\u2019s precision work that could go sideways quickly.\nIf a seal falls out, gets nicked or cut, or gets reused instead of replaced, it can cause a leak that depletes the refrigerant over the course of days, weeks, or months. As well, if dirt and other contaminants get into the system while you\u2019re working on it, other parts can fail too. Plus, you might discover that there are other issues contributing to poor A/C performance, and the A/C might still not blow as cold as it once did.\n\nAnd whether you\u2019re working on it yourself or bringing parts to a professional, find your new A/C compressor at your local AutoZone.

        "title": "How Much Does It Cost to Replace Your A/C?\u00a0",
        "content": "How an AC Compressor Works\u00a0\n\nThe compressor circulates refrigerant throughout the system, and it is responsible for cooling the air that flows into the cabin. The compressor is driven by a belt connected to the engine, and it uses a series of valves to control the flow of refrigerant. When the AC system is turned on, the compressor starts circulating refrigerant and cooled air is directed into the cabin. The compressor will continue to run as long as the AC system is turned on, and it will cycle off and on as needed to maintain a comfortable temperature.\u00a0\nIt works by compressing the refrigerant and then sending it to the condenser. When the refrigerant reaches the condenser, it is cooled and turned back into a liquid. From there, it flows through the expansion valve and into the evaporator, where it picks up heat from the air and turns back into a gas. Finally, it returns to the compressor to start the cycle gain. By circulating the refrigerant through this continuous loop, the AC compressor keeps the air in the cabin cool and comfortable.\u00a0\n\nWhat Causes an AC Compressor to Fail?\u00a0\n\nAn AC compressor is a central part of a car\u2019s air conditioning system, and it can fail for many reasons. One common cause of compressor failure is a leak that can occur in the seals or gaskets, allowing refrigerant to escape. This not only reduces the efficiency of the system, but it can also put extra strain on the compressor, eventually leading to failure.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother common cause of compressor failure is wear and tear. Over time, the moving parts in the compressor can become worn down, making it less effective at circulating the refrigerant that\u2019s responsible for cooling the air. Eventually, this wear and tear can lead to complete failure.\u00a0\u00a0\nCompressor failure can also be caused by electrical problems. If the compressor isn\u2019t getting enough power, it won\u2019t be able to do its job properly. This can be caused by a faulty fuse, a problem with the wiring, or even a dead battery.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSigns of Compressor Problems\u00a0\n\nOne of the most common signs of an ac compressor problem is strange noises coming from under the hood. If you hear hissing, clicking, or rattling noises, it could be a sign that the compressor is failing and needs to be replaced. Other common symptoms include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nReduced air temperature from the vents\u00a0\nMoisture inside the windshield won\u2019t clear\u00a0\nOily traces around the compressor\u00a0\nBlown AC compressor fuse\u00a0\nBelt squeal or shredded belt\u00a0\nBurnt wiring at the compressor\u00a0\n\nWhile some repair shops that specialize in AC solutions might be able to rebuild a bad compressor, the presence of these symptoms usually indicates it\u2019s time to have a new one installed.\u00a0\n\nAC Compressor Replacement Cost\u00a0\n\nThat leads to the big question: what does an AC compressor cost? A select few are under $200 for certain models, but you can expect the part to be in the range of $400 to a little over $2,000. Most often, the AC compressor cost for car models that are relatively common will be around $700 to $800.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut that doesn\u2019t include the labor or any additional parts needed to get the job done. As well, the refrigerant needs to be recovered and recharged to get the new compressor functioning. All said and done, expect a total repair cost, on average, in the vicinity of $900 to $1,200.\u00a0\n\nCan I Change an AC Compressor Myself?\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s possible to replace an AC compressor on your own if you\u2019re a mechanically inclined person. There are aspects of the job that must be left to a professional technician certified in AC repairs. Since the refrigerant most cars use, R134a, is a potent greenhouse gas contributor, it must be recovered from the car before the old compressor is removed. Then, when the repair is done, it needs to be recharged with precisely the right amount of gas for the system to work.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn most situations, it\u2019s better and easier to supply your new parts from AutoZone and have a pro do the repair for you. And if you\u2019re searching for the right parts or advice on getting the job done, ask an AutoZone associate today.",

        "title": "What is an ECT Sensor?\u00a0",
        "content": "How an ECT Sensor Works\nIn most situations, the sensor is a thermistor that has decreasing electrical resistance as the temperature goes up. One wire offers supply voltage for reference, and the change in voltage on the second wire is measured by the ECU to approximate the coolant temperature.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, many vehicles have more than one engine temperature sensor installed. This way, the car\u2019s computer can detect whether the thermostat is open or closed.\u00a0\nHowever, it\u2019s more than just monitoring temperature for the dash gauge. The ECT sensor\u2019s signal is used by the engine control module to adjust the car\u2019s performance and to initiate the cooling fans. If it stops working, you\u2019ll not only be unable to see the engine temperature on the cluster but your engine could be vulnerable to overheating.\u00a0\n\nSymptoms of a Failed ECT Sensor\u00a0\n\nThe ECT sensor is a critical part of your engine\u2019s cooling system, and it plays a critical role in engine performance too. It monitors the temperature of the coolant and relays that information to the engine control unit. If the ECT sensor fails, it can cause a number of problems.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe most common symptom is an overheating engine. The ECT sensor is responsible for triggering the fan when the engine gets too hot, so if it fails, the fan will not turn on. As a result, the engine will continue to heat up until it seizes.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther symptoms of a failed ECT sensor include:\u00a0\n\nPoor fuel economy\u00a0\nA check engine light\u00a0\nEngine knock or ping from improper timing adjustment\u00a0\nRough idle\u00a0\nAnd an incorrect temperature reading on the dash.\u00a0\n\nIf your ECT sensor fails, it\u2019s important to have it replaced as soon as possible. Otherwise, you could be facing major engine damage.\u00a0\n\nWhere the ECT Sensor is Located\u00a0\n\nThe ECT sensor is often located on the engine block, usually near the thermostat housing. On some engines, it may be located on the intake manifold. The sensor measures the temperature of the coolant and sends a signal to the computer. The computer uses this information to adjust the ignition timing and fuel mixture.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, the location isn\u2019t always the same, so pulling up a repair procedure online is a great idea before you start taking things apart.\u00a0\n\nHow to Change an ECT Sensor\n\nFortunately, changing an ECT sensor is a relatively easy job that anyone can do with a few tools and some basic knowledge. Here\u2019s how to do it:\n\n1. Let the engine cool \n\nHot coolant can scald you, causing serious burns. Always let the engine cool completely before working on the cooling system. \n\n2. Find the sensor \n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to locate the ECT sensor. It\u2019s usually located on the thermostat housing or on the water pump. Once you\u2019ve found it, disconnect the electrical connector.\n\n3. Drain the coolant if necessary \n\nMost ECT sensors are mounted high on the engine, so there will be minimal coolant loss when the sensor is removed. If yours is not at the top, it might be necessary to drain the engine coolant first. It\u2019s a good time to refill it with new coolant, if that\u2019s the case. \n\n4. Remove the sensor \n\nUnscrew the sensor from its mounting bracket. A box end wrench that fits well is your best choice here. \n\n5. Install the new sensor \n\nNext, take the new ECT sensor and screw it into place. Be sure not to overtighten it, as this can damage the threads.  \n\n6. Top up the coolant \n\nIf you had to drain coolant for your ECTS replacement, now\u2019s the time to fill the engine coolant system.  \n\n7. Finish assembly \n\nReconnect the electrical connector, start up your car, and check to make sure that the engine temperature is reading correctly. If it is, then you\u2019re done! Changing an ECT sensor is a simple process that any DIYer can do. Just be sure to follow these steps carefully and you\u2019ll be back on the road in no time. \n\nWhat Does It Cost to Replace an ECT Sensor?\u00a0\n\nIf your ECT sensor needs to be replaced, it will typically cost between $200 and $400. This includes the cost of labor, which is usually between $100 and $150, and the cost of parts, which is usually between $5 and $250. The exact cost will depend on the make and model of your vehicle and where you have the work done.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you have a luxury vehicle, or if you need to have the work done by a dealership, you can expect to pay on the higher end of this range. However, if you have a more affordable vehicle and you\u2019re able to do the work yourself, you can expect to pay on the lower end of this range. Either way, it\u2019s important to budget for this repair so that you\u2019re not caught off guard by the cost.",

        "title": "How to Flush Your Car's AC System",
        "content": "What is an AC Flush?\n\nAn AC flush, in simple terms, is the act of using compressed air to\u00a0send a solution through the AC system,\u00a0which cleanses and\u00a0grabs\u00a0any contaminants and particles, and flushes them out of the system.\u00a0An AC flush is only performed when the system is opened, or when a major component like the AC compressor is changed out.\nWhile doing this may seem simple, the practice is often overlooked\u00a0or skipped by\u00a0DIYers, which can cause a myriad of problems if contaminants are in the system.\u00a0When done properly, the evaporator, condenser, and AC lines are all properly flushed clean,\u00a0while the compressor and accumulator / receiver drier are\u00a0changed.\n\nWhy AC Systems Need Flushing\n\nThe AC system is a closed, self-contained system composed of 2 things \u2013 refrigerant, which is what makes the system have its cooling properties, and oil, needed to properly lubricate the system\u2019s compressor\u00a0\u2013 the only moving part. Any time the AC system is opened to the atmosphere, the probability of contaminants entering the system is high. When a component like the AC compressor fails, contaminants are often ejected into the system\u00a0from the failing compressor. \nOnce contaminants are in the system, these will recirculate, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before they can cause more components, like a\u00a0brand-new\u00a0AC compressor, to fail.\u00a0When a newly installed compressor fails,\u00a0the vast majority of\u00a0the time it\u2019s because of contaminants in the system.\n\nWhen AC Systems Need Flushing\n\nAnytime your AC compressor has failed and is being changed, an AC flush should always be performed.\u00a0Any time the system is opened, or has been opened, a flush should be performed. If you are operating on a system that has sat idle and without refrigerant for a long period of time (like a project car), the entire system should be flushed before attempting to\u00a0recharge the system. You will use\u00a0a\u00a0flushing tool to blast out the evaporator, condenser, and then clean each AC line.\u00a0\nOnce flushed, the hoses can be put back on, the compressor attached, along with a new receiver drier or accumulator.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0important to note that any time the AC system is opened, the receiver drier or accumulator should always be changed.\n\nHow to Flush Your Car\u2019s AC System\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about doing these functions, you can always search through our\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0for\u00a0someone in your area that does AC repairs and flushes.\u00a0To do a flush, you will need the following\u00a0items:\n\nAC flush tool\u00a0\u2013 Loan-A-Tool part number 57377\nAC flush solution\u00a0part number 210157\nPiece of \u00be or 5/8 heater hose \u2013 2\u2032\nBucket\nAir compressor, hose, and blow gun\nVacuum pump\u00a0\u2013 Loan-A-Tool part number\u00a057376\nManifold gauges\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Loan-A-Tool part number 57375\n\nTo properly flush the system, follow these\u00a0steps:\n\n1. Setting Things Up\n\nIn most cases of an AC flush, the car will be parked, and the AC system opened, usually by the lines at the compressor being disconnected. Remove the receiver drier / accumulator and all AC lines leading to the evaporator and condenser.\n\n2. Start with the Evaporator\n\nStart by flushing the evaporator, which is the fittings leading into the firewall. Use your piece of heater hose to slip over one of the threaded fittings and feed the hose into your empty bucket. \nNext, use your flushing tool to blast the flush solution into the other hose inlet. The air and flush solution will then drain out and into the bucket, along with any contaminants.\n\n3. Next, the Condenser\n\nNext, move to the condenser, repeating the same process by putting the hose on the lower of the two fittings on the condenser, and blasting flush solution through the condenser.\n\n4. Then the AC Hoses\n\nNext, take each AC hose that was removed and put one end of the hose in the bucket. Blast flush solution through the hose. Take note, if the hose has the accumulator / receiver drier attached at the point, you will want to remove it since it will be replaced with a new unit. Some hoses have a built in accumulator / drier. In these cases, the hose will need to be replaced.\n\n5. Reattach the Hoses\n\nOnce everything has been flushed, the hoses can be reattached with new o-rings, and the compressor installed.\n\n6. Check Your Work\n\nAt this point, the system should be brought under vacuum to check for any leaks, and to remove all atmospheric air from the system. Then, recharge the AC system using the proper amount of oil and refrigerant.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nFlushing the AC system of your car\u00a0is not a step that should ever be skipped, especially when servicing the AC compressor.\u00a0For\u00a0an AC system to properly work, the system must be 100% clean of any contaminants, and be 100% refrigerant and oil only. Any deviation from this\u00a0can and\u00a0will cause compressor and system failure.

        "content": "How Does the AC Compressor Work?\n\nThe air conditioning compressor\u00a0is powered by mechanical energy from the\u00a0drive belt on your engine,\u00a0and compresses R134a (or other refrigerants).\u00a0It is essentially a pump, drawing in refrigerant, compressing it, and pumping it out.\u00a0This pressurized\u00a0refrigerant\u00a0then makes its way through the AC system, where different components take the refrigerant from a gas to a liquid, which cools it rapidly, where\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0cold state does its job to keep the vehicle\u2019s cabin interior cool.\nThe compressor contains several parts which can\u00a0fail.\u00a0One of the most common of these parts which can have problems is the compressor clutch, which\u00a0engages\u00a0or disengages\u00a0to turn on or off the compressor as needed. If this part breaks while engaged, the compressor will always be running. If it breaks while disengaged, it won\u2019t run at all.\u202fOther times,\u00a0the bearings located within the clutch can also fail, causing noise.\u00a0Compressors can also have bad seals, causing leaks, or\u00a0the mechanical internals can simply fail due to wear, age, or lack of proper oil.\nIf your compressor isn\u2019t working, you\u2019ll know it\u00a0because it\u2019s one\u00a0of many reasons your AC could be non-functioning, meaning a broken compressor will result in your vents blowing hot air.\u00a0It\u2019s important to understand that your vehicle\u2019s AC not working could be caused by\u00a0a number of\u00a0issues \u2013 anywhere from just being low on refrigerant,\u00a0a bad cycling switch or relay, or a faulty compressor. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to correctly diagnose what\u2019s wrong with your AC system before you start replacing parts.\n\nHow Much Does an AC Compressor Replacement Cost?\n\nAn AC compressor change can be complex based on the parts needed to do the repair properly. This can vary quite a bit\u00a0based on the vehicle you drive, and where the compressor is situated on the engine.\u00a0Besides the compressor, there are other parts that should always be replaced at the same time the compressor is being serviced. \nIt\u2019s also important to note, that if your compressor suffered internal failure, the entire AC system\u2019s lines\u00a0and components will need to be properly flushed out\u00a0of contaminants. Failure to do this is a\u00a0guaranteed-ticket\u00a0for another failed compressor, as these same contaminants will damage the new one.\nIn general, keep in mind the following parts, which should be changed when doing a\u00a0compressor:\n\nThe complete AC compressor assembly\nAll necessary seals to hook up the AC\u00a0lines\nAccumulator or receiver drier\nOrifice Tube (if equipped)\n\nIf you are\u00a0mechanically-inclined, you can potentially avoid\u00a0all\u00a0labor costs by replacing the compressor\u00a0yourself. Just\u00a0be sure that you research the other components listed above, and their replacement as well. It\u2019s worth noting that this job is somewhat complicated, and probably not a good choice for new DIYers. You\u2019ll need some specialized tools like a vacuum pump and a set of manifold gauges to do the job right.\u00a0\nIf your AC clutch has failed, these can many times be replaced on their own without swapping the\u00a0compressor but\u00a0require special tools and procedures to swap out properly. Many times, the entire compressor is more cost-effective to replace.\nGenerally speaking, to\u00a0have a shop\u00a0properly change an AC compressor and related components, flush, and re-fill the AC system will run between\u00a0$750 \u2013 1500.00. Depending on the model and cost of the parts in general, this cost could be even higher.\u00a0\nTo DIY this project, the cost of parts, flush, and refrigerant will\u00a0generally run\u00a0between $350.00 \u2013 650.00. Keep in mind that when dealing with air conditioning,\u00a0having the system properly charged by a professional is a good practice to ensure the system is properly charged and functioning.\n\nHow Long Does an AC Compressor Last?\n\nAn AC compressor is\u00a0not a maintenance part which you are expected to regularly replace on some interval. The compressor only needs to be replaced\u00a0if it fails.\u00a0They\u00a0can last the lifetime of the car, but\u00a0generally a\u00a0compressor\u2019s life span is around 10-12 years and 150 to 200K miles.\n\nIs it Safe to Drive with a Bad AC Compressor?\n\nMost of the time, yes.\u00a0It\u2019ll\u00a0be hot, but your car will run and still be safe to drive. The scenario when you should not drive a car with a bad AC compressor is if the\u00a0clutch or\u00a0pulley\u00a0is damaged, as this could break\u00a0or de-route\u00a0the serpentine belt and leave you stranded.\u00a0\nIf you suspect a bad clutch bearing or\u00a0pulley,\u00a0locate\u00a0the compressor while the engine is running and\u00a0observe\u00a0the front\u00a0pulley/clutch where the belt runs. If you hear any grinding or noises coming from this area, this is a concern. Stop the engine, and if possible, check the front of the\u00a0pulley\u00a0for any\u00a0side to side\u00a0motion,\u00a0slop, or play,\u00a0paying caution to the fact that the engine is hot. \nIf you hear noise, or\u00a0observe\u00a0any\u00a0slop\u00a0or play in this\u00a0pulley, the\u00a0clutch is more than likely bad.\u00a0If the clutch\u2019s\u00a0pulley\u00a0is still functioning properly, driving your vehicle is safe until replacement or AC diagnosis\u00a0is performed.\nNow that you have a general idea of what to expect, consider getting an estimate that is specific to your vehicle by contacting one of\u00a0our preferred shops\u00a0near you. Or, if\u00a0you\u2019re\u00a0planning\u00a0on going\u00a0the DIY-route,\u00a0find all the parts and tools you need at our local auto parts store near you!",

        "title": "How Much Does an AC Recharge Cost?",
        "content": "How Much Does It Cost to Recharge Your Car\u2019s AC?\nThese costs are generally not that expensive when considering that this maintenance also extends the life of your compressor, keeping your air conditioning performing optimally season after season.\nA professional AC recharge cost ranges from $150 \u2013 $300 on average depending on the make and model of your vehicle. Due to\u00a0refrigerant\u00a0losses that occur over time, this service is one that should be added to your vehicle maintenance schedule. It is recommended that this service be performed on a vehicle every 100,000 miles or so.\nYou can save on your\u00a0this cost\u00a0by going the DIY route and recharging your car\u2019s AC, in which case you can expect to pay\u00a0$40-60\u00a0for a proper recharge kit. This\u00a0may seem like\u00a0a real savings over\u00a0taking the car into the shop\u00a0and\u00a0possibly\u00a0more convenient, but before proceeding\u00a0with the DIY alternative, it\u2019s important to understand exactly what\u2019s going on when you get an AC service at a shop, vs doing the job yourself.\u00a0\nWhat Does Recharging Your AC Mean?\nServicing\u00a0your vehicle\u2019s air conditioning system is an expected maintenance\u00a0item\u00a0for\u00a0all vehicles with operational\u00a0AC.\u00a0It\u2019s commonly done by dealerships\u00a0or\u00a0shops,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0involves hooking your vehicle up\u00a0to a machine\u00a0that removes refrigerant from the system, and simultaneously puts the vehicle\u2019s system under vacuum. \nThis is done to properly test the system for leaks and see if it holds vacuum over a certain\u00a0period of time.\u00a0By doing this, the technician\u00a0is able to\u00a0detect leaks, and\u00a0potentially determine their origin. This is important because simply filling the vehicle up with more refrigerant\u00a0will only\u00a0be a temporary fix if there is a leak that this new refrigerant can escape through.\u00a0\nIf the system checks out fine for vacuum,\u00a0the machine recharges the system to the precise amounts of refrigerant needed to operate, and then is checked for proper function.\u00a0Doing this\u00a0assures\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0compressor works efficiently to deliver the cooling levels required for your specific vehicle make and model.\n\n\u00a0The most common refrigerant for newer model cars is R-134a, which\u00a0has been the standard since 1994 when cars with R-12 refrigerant weren\u2019t phased out.\u00a0Many older cars\u00a0that have never been serviced\u00a0may use R-12\u00a0and need to be retrofitted over to R-134a.\u00a0Newer vehicles in just the last few years now take a new generation of refrigerant, R-1234yf, which has just become available for DIY use in the last 2 years.\nWhen Should You Recharge Your AC?\nThe first signs\u00a0of an AC compressor not functioning properly\u00a0will be air flow that is warmer than usual when electing the coolest of settings. Air conditioning systems can lose\u00a0refrigerant in very small doses\u00a0over time, but rapid leaks are a cause for concern. \nIt\u2019s important to note, that\u00a0while\u00a0simply grabbing a can of refrigerant\u00a0and charging your system will\u00a0certainly get your\u00a0AC\u00a0working again, it\u2019s vital that you pay attention to the proper pressure of the system\u00a0and don\u2019t over-charge. Some AC systems, especially newer R-1234yf systems\u00a0do not take a large amount of refrigerant\u00a0\u2013 some as little as 6oz \u2013\u00a0and over-charging the system can lead to catastrophic failure.\u00a0\nIf you\u00a0have successfully charged the\u00a0system\u00a0yet\u00a0weeks later, you feel warm air again,\u00a0you\u00a0probably\u00a0have a leak. Air conditioning systems have several connections in which these leaks can occur, so regular maintenance can help you avoid costly repairs in the future while maintaining optimal cooling throughout the life of your vehicle. \nIt is expected that at 100,000 miles, your air conditioning system will require servicing. At the first sign of your air conditioning performance not up to par, you should be aware that an AC recharge is probably warranted with an accompanying AC recharge cost.\u00a0\nCan You Recharge Your Car\u2019s AC?\nRecharging your air conditioning system is not a difficult task,\u00a0but one that requires some research.\u00a0It is crucial to make sure you know how to recharge it safely and properly.\u00a0\nFirst, you will want to confirm the type of refrigerant required for your specific vehicle.\u00a0If you\u2019ve confirmed that your vehicle uses R-134\u00a0or R-1234yf, or has been converted from R-12,\u00a0you\u00a0can\u00a0purchase a recharge kit which will include the recommended\u00a0refrigerant,\u00a0dispensable from a pressurized can of approximately 12 ounces to 22 ounces and\u00a0in most cases will contain\u00a0a reusable recharge hose outfitted with an inline pressure gauge. This pressure gauge will assure the proper amounts of\u00a0refrigerant\u00a0are delivered by measuring existing levels\u00a0(measured as pressure)\u00a0and reflecting maximum levels realized for proper recharging.\u00a0\nEven though most cans do contain a charging hose, using a proper manifold gauge (hose) set is highly recommended and will get you more accurate measurements on your vehicle\u2019s system.\u00a0Instructions are included within the recharge kit to properly do this service yourself. Next, you will want to identify the\u00a0low-side\u00a0delivery point for the\u00a0refrigerant\u00a0on your vehicle\u2019s system. Refer to your owner\u2019s manual\u00a0or online guides\u00a0for your specific car\u00a0for this information,\u00a0or,\u00a0you can read more about charging your AC system yourself\u00a0here.\nWhat Happens If You Overcharge Your AC?\nWhen performing this\u00a0service\u00a0yourself, you will have the proper recharge kit to guide you in delivering the proper amount of\u00a0refrigerant\u00a0into your vehicle\u2019s air conditioning system. However, it is possible to deliver too much\u00a0refrigerant, resulting in an \u2018overcharge\u2019 of the air conditioning system. The result is that your compressor will not be able to provide the proper cooling levels and warm air will be delivered into your vehicle instead.\u00a0This is why\u00a0it\u2019s best to tread very carefully when assuming that a non-functioning air conditioning unit is low on refrigerant, as this is not always the case. \nf you do over-charge the system, it is best to take the vehicle to a mechanic to have the system properly evacuated by an AC machine, and thus serviced to the correct amount.

        "title": "How Your Car's Interior Heating System Works",
        "content": "Your Car\u2019s Heating System\n\n Luckily, internal combustion engines have no shortage of heat, so the air that is brought in through the duct can pass by a heater core. The heater core is essentially a small radiator that is filled with hot coolant from the car\u2019s engine cooling system. The airflow passes over this heater core, allowing for heat exchange that cools the core while heating up the air before it reaches the cabin interior.\n\nThis might seem very straightforward at first, and it certainly is efficient, but the system gets more complicated when it comes to regulating temperature. Without some mechanism to do this, your car\u2019s interior temperature would depend on how hard the engine was working. The two most common ways that cars regulate temperature are by using a water-valve or air-blending. The valve method is more common on older cars, and has a valve that allows more or less hot coolant into the heater core depending on the desired interior temperature. Air-blending systems keep the heater core at full operation, but keep the temperature within a desired range by using flaps that can let in cold outside air to mix with the heated air.\n\nWhy is My Car Heater Not Working?\n\nHaving your car blow cold air in the winter is terrible, and in some climates in can be downright unsafe. Common causes of a car heater that\u2019s not working include:\n\nLow Coolant: If there\u2019s not enough coolant in the car, the heater core might not be able to get enough hot coolant in it to heat up the cabin air. Check this one first, because it is comparatively easy to top off the coolant. Also, air pockets in the coolant system can cause your heater core to not get a proper supply of coolant. This happens often when coolant is flushed and replaced without\u00a0properly bleeding the system, which needs to be done on certain vehicles to remove these air pockets.\nBad Blower: This one\u2019s also pretty easy to diagnose. If your car gets hot, but won\u2019t blow that hot air, you may need a new blower fan motor. To make sure, check the fuse, blower motor resistor, and wiring first including the ground circuit.\nFaulty Thermostat: If your car\u2019s temperature gauge stays on C well into operation of the engine, you might have a non-working thermostat. Some cars won\u2019t divert hot coolant to the heater core until the engine has heated up. For a lot of reasons, it\u2019s important to replace the thermostat ASAP if it is not working.\nClogged or Restricted Heater Core: Coolant that is not changed frequently enough gets contaminated, and this contamination can cause corrosion or clogs in the heater core. Make sure to check every other possible cause first, installing a new heater core can be a time-consuming DIY job or an expensive professional one.\nStuck Blend Door / Actuator:\u00a0Inside the dash, you have a blend door that shuts off the airflow to the AC side of the system and opens the heat-side, or vice-versa. There are also a series of actuators that help open and close the blend door, or various directions that the air flows (like defrost as opposed to the floor or vents) The blend door can become stuck, or actuators fail, causing air not to flow through the heater core properly.",

        "content": "3 AC Tools to do the Complete Job\n\n1. Manifold Gauges Keep Tabs on Refrigerant Pressure\n\nManifold gauge sets are designed to measure pressure automotive air conditioning systems systems. They have three hoses: the blue hose connects to the low-pressure side of the system, the red hose connects to the high-pressure side, and the yellow hose connects to a refrigerant refill can.\nThe set can be used to refill a system that\u2019s gotten low on refrigerant, but these tools are more versatile than a simple recharge gauge like come attached on some cans of refrigerant, this gauge will only tell you the low-pressure. A manifold gauge set will measure both high- and low-side pressures, and you can compare these pressures to the pressures specified in the owner\u2019s manual or on our guide: How to Recharge AC. By measuring both sides of the system with precise gauges, the set can be used to test your system by reading the pressure of both sides of the system. \nToo much pressure on the high-side indicates too much refrigerant in the system, a restriction or air in the lines, or insufficient airflow at the condenser. Too little pressure on the high-side is often caused by low refrigerant levels or a bad compressor. Excess pressure on the low-side indicates too much refrigerant or a defective compressor. Insufficient low-side pressure means there is a restriction on the low-side of the system, or insufficient refrigerant or airflow across the condenser.\nThey can also test to ensure the system can maintain a vacuum. If the system cannot and pressure is decreasing, your system has a leak. It will also tell you how much vacuum the system can maintain should you decide to use a vacuum pump.\n\n2. Flush Kits Clean Out Your AC System\n\nAC flush kits use a special flushing liquid and compressed air to flush the system clean of debris and other contamination. Some components may not need replacing but will need to be flushed out to keep from contaminating the new components. It flushes everything except for the accumulator and compressor which should be disconnected before flushing. This allows it to clean out your evaporator, condenser, and AC system lines.\nThe kits must be filled with both a flushing solvent and compressed air. The air forces the solvent through the system to ensure that the whole system gets properly cleared of debris.\n\n3. Vacuum Pumps Remove Moisture and Check for Leaks\n\nUsing a vacuum pump is often overlooked when performing the complete job. Applying a vacuum for 45-60 minutes will accomplish two things: removing moisture and checking for leaks, setting up your repaired system for continued successful operation.\nThe ability of the system to reach and maintain a state of vacuum is a sign that the system should be leak free. If the system is unable to reach 29 in/Hg (inches of mercury, the unit of measurement used when measuring vacuum) of vacuum, or the vacuum fails as soon as the pump is turned off, a leak probably still exists in the system.\n\nGet the AC Tools You Need Through the\u00a0Loan-A-Tool\u00ae Program\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nLearn more about\u00a0how car AC works\u00a0and some of the most\u00a0common AC problems.",

        "title": "How Your Car\u2019s AC Works",
        "content": "How Does a Car\u2019s Air Conditioning Work?\n\nAny AC system requires a refrigerant, such as R-134a. Your vehicle\u2019s compressor, powered by the serpentine belt, compresses the refrigerant into a liquid, putting it into a high-pressure state. This pressure forces the liquid out of the compressor through the hoses in your AC hose assembly, which carry refrigerant through the system. Regardless of which of the systems your car uses, the compressed refrigerant travels from the compressor to the condenser on the high-pressure side of the system to cool off before reaching the AC evaporator core on the low-pressure side.\nThe condenser is like a small radiator where the AC hoses come in contact with the outside air, which absorbs heat from the liquid inside before the liquid reaches the AC in-line filter, which removes debris that could contaminate the system. The now cooled refrigerant moves to the low-pressure side of the system through either the expansion valve or the orifice tube, depending on which system you have. There it goes through the evaporator core in a gaseous state, allowing the refrigerant to absorb heat from the air that passes through the evaporator fins. This leaves the cabin with cool air while the warm refrigerant makes its way back to the compressor.\nScroll down to see a step-by-step breakdown of how refrigerant travels through your car\u2019s AC parts.\n*Air conditioning systems will use either an orifice tube/accumulator or an expansion valve/receiver-drier set up. Some vehicles that have a rear AC system can use a combination of the two with an additional evaporator.\n\nAutomotive AC System Components\n\n1. The System is Filled with Refrigerant\n\nThe refrigerant gas used in most vehicles is commonly known as R134A. Prior to 1994, R12 was used in air conditioning systems, but was discontinued due to the highly polluting nature of the gas. The ability of the refrigerant to change its physical properties as it is compressed, cooled and metered is what makes the AC system work.\n\n2. The Refrigerant is Turned into Liquid by the Compressor\n\nThe compressor is responsible for compressing the refrigerant gas. When the gas is compressed it becomes very hot and is then sent through a condenser.\n\n3. Refrigerant is Cooled in the Condenser\n\nThe condenser is a series of coils that outside air passes over to remove the heat from the compressed gas. This will cause the gas to cool and condense into a cold liquid.\n\nA parallel style (non-serpentine) condenser cannot be flushed and must be replaced if it fails.\nA serpentine-style condenser can be identified by inspecting the ends of the component and observing a snake like appearance that indicates a long singular tube that switches back several times almost like a ribbon. This style condenser can be flushed using the AC Flush Kit available in the AutoZone Loan-A-Tool program.\n\n4. Air is Dried in the Receiver-Drier*\n\nThe receiver-drier is a canister that contains desiccant inside to absorb moisture. The receiver-drier sometimes has a sight-glass on top to observe flow (however, on retrofitted systems the sight glass will be rendered useless since the oil used with R134A is not transparent), while an accumulator will not.\n*In expansion valve and receiver-drier systems\n\n5. Debris is Removed by the AC Inline Filter\n\nThe AC Inline Filter Kit traps debris that even flushing cannot remove from your AC lines.\n\n6. The Liquid Refrigerant is Turned into Mist by the Expansion Valve*\n\nThe expansion valve provides a restriction in the flow of refrigerant. This restriction causes the refrigerant to change from a high-pressure liquid refrigerant into low-pressure liquid refrigerant mist before it enters the evaporator. The failure of an expansion device is usually restricted flow due to clogging.\n*In expansion valve and receiver-drier systems\n\n7. \u2026or by the Orifice Tube*\n\nThe orifice tube has a conical shaped fixed orifice that provides restriction in the flow of refrigerant. This restriction causes the refrigerant to change from high pressure liquid refrigerant into low pressure liquid refrigerant mist before it enters the evaporator. The failure of an orifice tube is usually restricted flow due to clogging.\n*In orifice tube and accumulator systems\n\n8. The Mist Removes Warm Air from the Cabin in the Evaporator\n\nAs the low-pressure liquid refrigerant mist flows through the evaporator, a blower motor pushes air across the cold tubes of the evaporator to deliver cooled air into the passenger compartment of the automobile.\n\n9. Moisture is Removed from the Mist by the Accumulator*\n\nThe accumulator is a holding tank for the refrigerant exiting the evaporator. While the refrigerant is circulating inside, the accumulator desiccant bag removes any moisture that may be present.\n*In orifice tube and accumulator systems\n\nTwo Common A/C Systems\n\nOrifice Tube and Accumulator System\n\nThis\ntype of system features an orifice tube before the evaporator core and an\naccumulator before the compressor. The orifice tube restricts the refrigerant\nflow, changing the high-pressure liquid to a low-pressure mist before entering\nthe evaporator. The accumulator is a holding tank with a desiccant bag to\nremove any moisture from the refrigerant before it reaches the compressor.\n\nExpansion Valve and Receiver-Drier System\n\nThis\nsystem has a receiver-drier between the condenser and the in-line filter kit\nand an expansion valve before the evaporator core. It contains desiccant to\nabsorb moisture like the accumulator does, but the receiver-drier is located on\nthe high-pressure side instead of the low-pressure side. The expansion valve\nplays the same role as the orifice tube in that it restricts refrigerant flow\nto allow the pressurized liquid to expand into a low-pressure mist.",

        "title": "Learn 3 Common AC Problems",
        "content": "How to Diagnose Your Car\u2019s AC Problems\n\n1. Is Your AC Cool but Not Cold?\n\nIf the air conditioning is set to max cool and fans on high, but is only blowing moderately cool air:Check to see that the cooling fans on the condenser or radiator are running when the air \u2013conditioning is on.Look for any restrictions like leaves, bugs or dirt that would keep air from passing over the condenser.Check the cabin air filter to ensure that it is not clogged.Beyond this, the next step is to always check the pressures in the system using a manifold gauge set. The recommended high-side and low-side pressures can be found in your vehicle\u2019s repair manual, or online. Once you have your gauges hooked up, move on to observing the AC compressor itself.\n\n2. Start with the AC Compressor\n\nWhen diagnosing an air conditioning issue, it\u2019s easiest to begin at the compressor:With the engine running turn the A/C on max cool, set fans high, and make sure that the clutch is engaging on the compressor. Note: this is not the pulley, but the center piece that engages the pulley to the compressor shaft. If the clutch is engaging and disengaging once every few seconds, this is a sign of low refrigerant. You will also see the low-side pressure on your gauge drop rapidly when the clutch engages, hit a point of too-low pressure, then disengage and the pressure will rise. As you add more refrigerant, the gauge will hold steady, with the compressor running, and should hold at the recommended pressure.\n\nIf the clutch is not engaging and the system has refrigerant, use a voltmeter to check for voltage getting to the compressor.\nIf there is voltage \u2013 the clutch may be bad.\nIf there is no voltage \u2013 a cycling switch may be bad, a fuse may be blown, and the system may not have enough refrigerant pressure to trip the low pressure cutoff switch that cycles the compressor.\n\n3. Most Problems are Caused by Leaks\n\nLeaks are the most common problem associated with the air conditioning system. If pressure is low, then there may be a leak:\n\nUsing a UV A/C leak detection kit is the easiest way to find a leak. Follow the instructions on the packaging to introduce UV dye to the system and UV light to find the leak.\nCheck around all fittings to verify that they are all secure.\nCheck hose manifolds on the compressor.\nCheck the front seal and the o-rings sealing the pressure switches on the back of some compressors.\nCheck where the hoses are crimped onto the fittings.\nCheck the Schrader Valves.Check for pin holes in the condenser.\n\nCheck where the evaporator drains condensation with UV light. Sometimes oil or dye can be seen.Note: The dye check will not work if the system is too low and the compressor is not cycling.\n\nStill Not Sure? Check These Components\n\nAC Compressor and Clutch\n\nThe AC compressor is a rotating pump that circulates refrigerant (Freon) throughout the system.\nCommon Problems: Leaks in one or more seals or the compressor itself can occur. Particle contamination from worn parts inside the compressor are a frequent culprit. The engagement clutch, called an AC clutch, can also fail rendering the compressor inoperative.\nWhat to Look For: If the refrigerant is low, check for visible system leaks that appear green and oily. Failing internal components caused by normal wear or low AC Oil levels caused by leaks. Failed AC clutch. Failed power supply to the AC clutch caused by a blown fuse, bad pressure control switch, dash control module or a broken circuit wire. Inspect and test before replacing!\n\nAC Accumulator / Drier\n\nThe Accumulator/Drier collects and absorbs moisture. Moisture is like poison to the internal system components and can damage the AC Compressor as well. Depending on your vehicle, you may have an accumulator or a receiver/drier.\nCommon Problems: Internal failure allowing desiccant material to enter the AC system. Like sugar in the gas tank, this stuff in the wrong places can cause major problems. Leaks can result in over-saturation of the desiccant material that can lead to compressor damage.\n\nAC Orifice Tube / Expansion Valve\n\nThe AC orifice tube / expansion device filters and regulates the flow of refrigerant through your air conditioning system. Depending on your vehicle, you may have an orifice tube or an expansion valve.\nCommon Problems: Contamination is the main cause of failure. If the system pressures are too high and/or too low, the expansion device could possibly be the issue. But first, ensure the refrigerant levels are correct and the radiator/A/C Condenser fan(s) are working properly. Remember, inspect and test before replacing!\n\nAC Condenser\n\nThe AC condenser looks similar to a radiator and works in conjunction with the radiator fan(s). Air flowing across the AC condenser tubes cool the hot (gaseous) refrigerant that absorbed heat from inside the vehicle. This returns the refrigerant back to a liquid state where it will once again enter the evaporator core and absorb more heat from the interior.\nCommon Problems: Refrigerant leaks. Contaminant particles from the AC Compressor or AC Accumulator/Drier restricting the flow of refrigerant can lead to poor cooling. While checking the AC Condenser, inspect the Radiator / AC cooling fan motor(s).\n\nAC Evaporator Core\n\nThe AC evaporator acts like a huge ice cube with holes in it. It allows the hot, cabin air to flow through the core, rapidly cools this air, and blows it out into the cabin again. The cool air felt from the dash vents is provided by the AC heater blower motor assembly.\nCommon Problems: The number one cause of failure is a leak due to age and wear. An electronic leak detector is the best way to check for leaks. Give attention to the AC evaporator box water drain tube. Use the tester to search for a leak. A green and oily substance may appear in the drain tube if larger leaks are present.",

If hooking a set of gauges to the vehicle, you will use both.\n*Most 1994 and older\u202fvehicles used R12 as the original refrigerant, if the vehicle being serviced is still using R12, it must be evacuated and retrofitted. Mixing R12 and any other refrigerant is illegal. Never use the high-side port to add refrigerant, doing so is very dangerous and could cause harm. You will notice an R12 style fitting right away as the hose screws on to attach and has the look of a tire valve, while an R134A fitting is a larger quick-connect.\u00a0ALSO\u00a0\u2013 starting in 2013, many vehicles began using\u00a01234YF refrigerant. This refrigerant is NOT compatible with R134A, and should be left to the professional to troubleshoot.\n\n3. Wipe Away Dust\n\nWipe away any dust with a clean rag and then remove the cap from low-side service port.\n\n4. Attach the Charging Hose\n\nAttach the charging hose to the low-side service port and ensure that you have a secure connection. If the hose does not attach easily you may be using the wrong port. Attach both connections if using a set of gauges.\n\n5. Add Refrigerant\n\nFollowing the instructions on the refrigerant package, add\u202frefrigerant\u202fto the system.\n\n6. Charge the System\n\nAfter determining the correct pressures using the ambient air pressure chart, monitor the pressure readings constantly while charging the system. If the system was low, your AC compressor clutch will not engage. You should notice that as the low-side pressure reaches approx. 25-30PSI, that the compressor clutch will engage. You may notice the compressor clutch engage and disengage as more refrigerant is added. Eventually, it should stay engaged all the time. It is absolutely important to note here that over-charging the system will cause permanent damage. If you are unsure of the current pressure, or amount of refrigerant in your system, you should\u00a0seek a professional mechanic near you\u00a0to address the issue.\n\n7. Remove the Charging Hose\n\nAfter the air conditioning system is charged to the proper pressure, remove the charging hose from the low-side service port, (or gauges) leaving the can attached to the charge hose, and store any additional refrigerant in a dry, cool spot.\n\n8. Check the Service Port Cap Seal Before Reinstalling\n\nEnsure that the seal beneath the cap does not have any cracks, nicks, or tears. This seal can be added protection if the Schrader valve ever formed a leak.\n\nAC Pressure Chart\n\nAfter you\u2019ve recharged your air conditioning, the difference should be noticeable immediately. It may be worth checking the pressure once or twice after recharging in case the low refrigerant level was caused by a leak in the system. If you believe there is a leak, get a\u202fUV light and some UV dye\u202fso you can find the leak. The UV dye will make the hole visible when the UV light is shined onto the A/C components.\nWhatever you need to work on your auto air conditioning system, you can get it at AutoZone.\n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone Store\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "content": "What Does the Cabin Air Filter Do?\n\nThe cabin filter exists to remove contaminants from the outside air that is pumped into the cabin interior when the fan is on. Air passes through a media material that is permeable to air, but which catches dirt and other stuff that might be with the air. Eventually these filters get clogged up as the contaminants get caught on the filter media. A bad cabin air filter won\u2019t clean the air as effectively, and it can noticeably restrict the air flow.\n\nHow Often to Change Cabin Air Filter\n\nReplacing your cabin air filter only takes a few minutes and helps protect your lungs by keeping the air inside your vehicle clean. If you notice restricted air flow from your climate control vents while you\u2019re driving around, it\u2019s probably worth checking the filter. As a rule, it should be replaced every 15,000 to 30,000 miles or if you notice they are dirty during an inspection. If you want a precise service interval, check your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nHow to Change Your Cabin Air Filter\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and make sure the parking brake is on. In some situations you may need a screwdriver or socket set, but most installations can be done by hand. \nSometimes the filter can be pretty dirty, so you may want to wear safety gloves and goggles, and even put a covering down on your passenger side floor mat. This is in case dust or debris fall out when removing the old filter.\n\n2. Get to the filter\n\nOpen and, often times, remove the glove box to access the cabin air filter. The owner\u2019s manual should have detailed information on removal. This may require a screwdriver, or simply pressing down on a tab or two. \nSome vehicles allow access without removing the glove box, but there are others where the cabin air filter is accessed from under the hood. The owner\u2019s manual or a Repair Guide will have detailed information on location & removal for your vehicle.\n\n3. Remove old cabin air filter\n\nRemove the old cabin air filter and any debris. Note the placement of the old filter. You may want to vacuum the area.\n\n4. Install the new filter\n\nInstall the new filter. Note the direction the old filter was installed and match the new filter. Air flow direction is usually indicated by arrows on the filter.\n\n5. Install the glove box\n\nInstall the glove box.

        "title": "Engine Air Filter vs Cabin Air Filter",
        "content": "Engine Air Filter: What It Is and Why It\u2019s Important\n\nAn engine air filter is a device that helps filter dirt, dust, and other debris out of the air that enters the engine. It is typically made of a pleated paper or fabric filter element, and its housing is designed to fit securely into the engine\u2019s air intake system.\nWhen you drive, air flows through the engine air filter and then passes through the engine\u2019s air intake system before finally entering the combustion chamber. The engine air filter traps dirt and debris before they can enter the engine, which helps prevent engine damage and improves performance.\nThis simplistic part helps prevent engine damage caused by dirt and debris. It can also help improve fuel efficiency, engine performance, and extend engine life. A dirty engine air filter can reduce airflow and cause the engine to run poorly, decreasing gas mileage and producing less power. It can even cause the engine to fail.\n\nCabin Air Filter: What It Is and Why It\u2019s Important\n\nA cabin air filter is a device that filters the air that enters the interior of your car through the ventilation system. Its main function is to filter out dust, pollen, and other particulates, as well as harmful gases such as exhaust fumes and ozone, which can cause health problems, especially for those with allergies or respiratory issues.\nWhen you turn on your car\u2019s air conditioning or heating system, air is drawn into the cabin air filter through the car\u2019s HVAC system. At this point, the filter traps any airborne particles before allowing the clean air to enter the cabin. The main advantage of a cabin air filter is that it significantly improves the air quality inside your car. A clean filter ensures that you and your passengers are breathing clean air, free of pollutants and harmful particles, and can reduce allergy symptoms. A clogged or dirty cabin air filter can cause your car\u2019s heating and air conditioning system to work less efficiently, producing less heat or cool air.\n\nDifferences Between Engine and Cabin Air Filters\n\nLocation\n\nAn engine air filter is under the hood in the airbox or air cleaner housing, at the end of the duct connecting to the intake.\n\nThe cabin air filter is usually located under the dash in a heater duct where the blower motor can draw air through it.\n\nConstruction\n\nAn engine air filter is made of pleated synthetic and natural fibers that help to trap particles in it, and it\u2019s often reinforced with a metal mesh and a rigid plastic frame.\u00a0\u00a0\nMost cabin air filters are made of a pleated paper or fabric filter material, similar to an engine air filter, although it\u2019s less reinforced. However, they usually have a layer of activated carbon that can absorb and neutralize odor-causing particles to address unpleasant odors in the air.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBenefits of Regular Maintenance and Replacement of Filters\n\nRegular maintenance and replacement of filters in your vehicle can mean the difference between a healthy engine and costly repairs, not to mention effects on your health. Benefits can include:\n\nImproved Efficiency. One of the most significant benefits of replacing your vehicle\u2019s filters regularly is improved efficiency. By increasing airflow, you can often achieve increased fuel efficiency and better performance for your engine. A clean cabin air filter can also help your car\u2019s heating and cooling system work more efficiently by ensuring proper airflow.\nProlonged Engine Life. Dust and debris can clog up your engine\u2019s air intake system, making it work harder than it needs to. This can lead to premature wear and tear on the engine and, eventually, engine failure. A clean air filter helps avoid wear and keeps yout engine healthy for longer.\nLower Repair Costs. A clogged engine air filter can cause your engine to work harder than it should, leading to costly repairs down the line. A clean air filter can help prevent engine damage and reduce the likelihood of expensive repairs.\nImproved Air Quality. Regularly replacing your vehicle\u2019s cabin air filter can also improve the air quality inside your car. A clogged or dirty cabin air filter can circulate pollutants and contaminants in the air, leading to poor air quality inside your vehicle. Regular replacement of this filter ensures that you and your passengers are breathing clean air, free of pollutants that can cause health problems.",

        "title": "Engine Air Filter vs. Cabin Air Filter: What\u2019s the Difference?",
        "content": "What\u2019s the Difference Between a Cabin Air Filter and an Engine Air Filter?\n\nThe main similarity between the cabin air filter and engine air filter is their purpose. Both are designed to protect your vehicle from dust, dirt, pollen, and other potentially harmful contaminants that can enter through the air intake system. The key difference with these two types of filters lies in where they are located within your car: the engine air filter can be found near the front of your vehicle under the hood, while the cabin air filter is usually found inside the passenger compartment near either side or behind glove box.\nAnother difference between these two filters is their size. While the engine air filters are usually considerably larger than cabin air filters due to the higher airflow they need to handle, they also have a much more complicated design which allows them to trap particles effectively. Cabin air filters on the other hand tend to be much smaller in size and simpler in design as they need to neatly fit within a tight space in the dash. Although they\u2019re smaller, they\u2019re often designed to filter out tinier particles like pollen and other allergens, plus cabin air filters commonly contain odor-neutralizing carbon within its layers.\nFinally, one last difference is that engine air filters can often be cleaned or replaced relatively easily in the engine bay. Cabin air filters sometimes require professional replacement because of where they\u2019re situated, like behind the glove box compartment.\n\nHow Often Should Air Filters Be Changed?\n\nWhen it comes to engine air filters, the general recommendation is to replace them after every 15,000 miles or approximately once a year. This will ensure that there\u2019s enough clean air passing through your vehicle\u2019s engine to prevent decreased performance due to restricted airflow. It\u2019s also important to inspect the filter regularly and replace it if it appears dirty or damaged.\nAs for cabin air filters, they usually need replacing less often, depending on your climate and driving conditions. They help keep the passenger compartment free from pollutants by filtering out any contaminants, bad smells, or odors. While these filters don\u2019t have an exact mileage limit, they should still be inspected regularly so you\u2019ll know when they need replacing. And many carmakers have a replacement interval in the maintenance schedule of around once every two years.\n\nThe Effects of a Dirty Air Filter or Cabin Air Filter\n\nAn air filter that\u2019s beginning to get dirty will continue to operate normally. But as it gets very dirty, it gets more restricted and symptoms can appear.\nSigns of a dirty engine air filter include:\n\nReduced fuel economy. The dirty filter restricts airflow and lowers the amount of oxygen reaching the engine, and more fuel is used to compensate for it.\nReduced power and acceleration. Less airflow into the engine will hinder the combustion process, and you won\u2019t get the same performance and power you\u2019re used to.\nPopping noises or stumbling. If the air filter is badly clogged, the engine could struggle to run, causing a misfire.\nCheck Engine Light on. An engine starved of air will eventually cause trouble codes as the engine isn\u2019t operating as it should.\n\nFor a dirty cabin air filter, on the other hand, symptoms could be:\n\nPoor A/C and heating performance. Noticeably weaker airflow through the vents is due to a plugged filter, and the hot or cold air you want can\u2019t pass through as easily.\nA bad smell. Contaminants trapped in the filter can be breeding grounds for bacteria or mildew, and repulsive odors can flow through the vents.\nDecreased defrosting capacity. Like the heater performance, poor airflow can struggle to keep your windows clear of moisture.\nFan noises. The blower motor might have debris caught up in it from a packed cabin air filter.\n\nOf course, for either the cabin air filter vs engine air filter, a bunch of dirt, leaves, bugs, and other debris in the filter\u2019s pleats would be an indication that it should be changed.\n\nCan I Replace Air Filters Myself?\n\nIf you\u2019re a DIYer, you can definitely change both the cabin air filter and the engine air filter on your own. Under the hood, you\u2019ll find the air cleaner housing where the engine air filter resides. It\u2019s often held closed with clips or a few screws, and when it\u2019s open, the filter can be swapped in seconds.\nFor the cabin air filter, you\u2019ll need to locate it first. Most often, it\u2019s behind the glove box. With the compartment door lowered or removed, identify the hatch or door that keeps the filter in place. Remove it, pull the old filter out, and slide a new filter in before buttoning it all back up.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Check your windshield wiper blades\u00a0\n\nCheck your windsheild wipers\nWiper blades can freeze to the windshield in a snowstorm, and ice and snow on the glass can act as an abrasive on the rubber edge. Check along the flexible rubber edge of each wiper blade for nicks and cuts. If you see damage, or if your wipers leave streaks behind after a pass, replace them both.\n\nInspect and top up the fluids\u00a0\n\nInspect and top fluids\nFluids can have moisture intrude or form from cycles between hot and cold temperatures. Contamination can occur, and oils can break down and lose viscosity. Check the color and level of each fluid including:\n\nEngine oil\nTransmission fluid\nEngine coolant\nBrake fluid\nPower steering fluid\nOn 4WD and AWD vehicles, differential and transfer case fluids\n\nIf they\u2019re in poor condition, flush and fill them with the appropriate fluids. Also, top up the windshield washer fluid.\n\nCheck the air filters\n\nCheck the air filters\nAlthough dust storms and bugs aren\u2019t the norm in the winter, the air still carries particles that will get caught in the air filters. Inspect the engine air filter as well as the cabin air filter to ensure they aren\u2019t coated in debris. Check that light passes through the pleats, indicating that air can still make its way through efficiently too. If the filters are dirty, smelly, or you can\u2019t see light through them, replace them. It\u2019s usually necessary every year as part of your vehicle maintenance schedule.\n\nTest the battery\n\nTest the Battery\n\nCheck the brakes\n\nCheck the brakes\nAs summer approaches, your brakes will need to be in good condition to bring your vehicle to a halt, and higher temperatures can cause brake pads and rotors to wear a little faster too. Make sure you\u2019re starting the season out right and that your brake pads have at least 3/16ths of an inch remaining at each wheel for both the inboard and outboard pad. Brake rotors shouldn\u2019t be gouged, and they shouldn\u2019t have ridges or pockmarks of rust on either side. If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process. Spark plugs, ignition cables, and fluid flushes may be due.

        "title": "How to Clean a Reusable K&N Air Filter",
        "content": "How Often Should You Clean Your Air Filter?\n\nBefore you start learning how to clean a car air filter, it\u2019s important to understand how frequently you\u2019ll need to clean it. Understanding your maintenance intervals will give you a basis on which you can start to build a routine. This way, you\u2019ll keep your car running smoothly and not have to worry about potential buildup in the engine.\nThe exact interval at which you should clean your car\u2019s reusable air filter will vary based on the kind of air filter you have, its location and your vehicle\u2019s engine specifications. It\u2019s best, therefore, to consult your owner\u2019s manual to find out exactly how frequently the manufacturer suggests cleaning the filter. Several factors can influence the schedule for cleaning your filter. They include:\nHow frequently you use your vehicleThe climate you live in and what types of particles are in the airIf you have made any modifications to the vehicle after-market\nEach of these factors may impact how frequently you\u2019ll need to clean the air filter. On average, however, you\u2019ll want to clean your air filter approximately every 50,000 miles, but you\u2019ll want to check on it every 25,000 miles. This cleaning schedule will help ensure your car\u2019s performance is not negatively impacted by debris in the engine.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of a Dirty Air Filter?\n\nYou might notice multiple signs that indicate you need to check your car\u2019s air filter.

        "title": "What is a Cold Air Intake?",
        "content": "How Does a Cold Air Intake\u00a0Work?\n\nAs a combustion engine, your car or truck\u2019s engine uses what amounts to a controlled explosion to fire your pistons. Gas or diesel serves as the fuel while an ignition source (spark plug in a gas engine, compression itself in a diesel) provides combustion. Oxygen is present in the air that surrounds your vehicle, but the enclosed nature of your hood prevents it from easily getting into your combustion chambers. The air intake is simply ductwork that allows the engines vacuum to pull air into the engine to mix with fuel and be fired. How much air it can pull is what\u2019s the question.\nWhile the OE model air intake works fine, it has the same problems as most stock parts. It\u2019s cheaply made to keep costs low and it\u2019s not specifically geared toward performance. After all, motor vehicle manufacturers don\u2019t know if you\u2019re buying their machine to commute to work, haul cargo, or drive fast. Secondly, because consumers generally care about a quiet, noise free cabin, intakes are designed to be quiet, which, similar to exhaust, often makes them very restrictive.\nYour typical stock unit has two main issues preventing it from operating efficiently. First, it\u2019s design is not catered to flow the maximum amount of flow (or CFM) possible. Secondly, it\u2019s design is simply to provide a quiet, efficient passage of air to the engine that the driver in the cabin cannot hear. OEM intakes generally have a\u00a0filter box\u00a0and duct work that is restrictive. This means air has to travel through the box, through the mesh of the filter, and through the restrictive tube to get to your engine. This is only made worse by the low-flow air filters you find in most cars and trucks. Couple that with an intake that\u2019s too close to the engine, drawing hotter air, and you have decreased performance.\nA cold air intake moves the intake point farther away from the engine, so it sucks in cooler air. Some of them also include a high-temperature shield to further reduce the heat radiating from your internal parts. By removing the air box , reducing restriction in the ducting, and getting rid of the low-quality paper filter, you create an intake that can flow more air per minute to the engine.\nYour vehicle is now using colder and denser air to run your powerplant. The denser the air, the more oxygen gets to your engine. This makes it operate more efficiently, providing a host of performance benefits.\n\nWhat Are the\u00a0Advantages of a Cold Air Intake?\n\nDo cold air intakes work? The increased oxygen flow can net you between 5 and 20 horsepower depending on your engine and the product you buy. Higher quality intakes obviously work better, but they can\u2019t turn a 4-cylinder into a V8 power, so keep your expectations realistic.\nBeyond the horsepower increase, cold air intakes can also provide better throttle response and improved fuel economy. When your engine has the ability to get more air, it has the ability to create more power.\nAnother plus of an aftermarket air intake is saying goodbye to low-quality paper filters. Not only can you install a high-flow filter, it also means don\u2019t have to replace it every 15,000 miles. Many of the filters available for cold air intakes can be removed and washed to clean them. Just remember to do it as part of your regular maintenance: a dirty filter won\u2019t do its job.\nTo increase the benefits of your install, consider adding a few other mods to your machine. The air intake is only one side of the oxygen coin. Spent gases can choke off your engine, preventing the cold air from being as effective. A\u202fperformance exhaust system\u00a0removes more of these gases from your engine, allowing for better combustion. An ECU tuner can provide a better fuel/air mixture to get the most from these components. Combining all 3 together \u2013 air intake, exhaust, and an ECU tune is generally referred to as \u201cStage 1\u201d in the tuning and modification world \u2013 it\u2019s the first and most basic steps to getting increased performance.\nThat isn\u2019t to say you need either of these additions to gain the benefits of a cold air intake. You still have denser air providing more oxygen to your engine. These mods just add to the advantages of the component.\n\nDo Cold Air Intakes Cause\u00a0Problems?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to recommend cold air intakes, but every mod has its minuses. Newer vehicles often feature more complicated components. Manufacturers generally limit the mods you can install to limit liability. In the case of an aftermarket air intake, this means the part may void your warranty. Check your warranty to see if this is true for your car or truck.\nThe lack of a box increases the chances your intake could suck up some water. Small amounts can cause misfires, ruin spark plugs, and reduce performance. If a larger volume of water gets into the combustion chamber, it won\u2019t compress under the piston, causing severe engine damage. For driving in wet areas, you should install a bypass valve on your air intake to prevent water from getting into your engine.\nThe shape of the intake occasionally causes problems as well. The air is coming from a difference angle than it is on an OE model, which can throw off the idle of your engine. It can also send inaccurate readings to your sensors, throwing off the fuel/air mixture. This issue is fairly rare, however, and can often be fixed with some tuning.\nFinally, cold air intakes do not take into consideration, much like performance exhaust, that additional sound can be an issue. In most vehicles, you will immediately hear a sound with a cold air intake you didn\u2019t hear before \u2013 the sound of air sucking or flowing through the intake! On vehicles with a turbo, this sound is often much more pronounced. For some owners, this sound, much like a well tuned, throaty exhaust is desired. For others, it may be considered too much.",

        "title": "How To Tell If Your Mass Air Flow Sensor Is Bad",
        "content": "How the MAF sensor works\n\nMAF sensors are located between the air filter and the throttle body and are responsible for measuring the amount of air entering the engine.\nMost vehicles have a hot wire MAF sensor. It has one heated wire and one ambient temperature wire. The microprocessor inside the MAF sensor measures the air entering the engine by maintaining the temperature of the hot wire 200\u00b0F above the ambient incoming air. The energy required to maintain the sensor at the same temperature is calculated and sent to the powertrain control module (PCM). The PCM then controls the injectors to deliver the specific amount of fuel that\u2019s proportional to the airflow, creating an air fuel mixture that, ideally, is perfect for your engine.\n\n3 SYMPTOMS OF A BAD MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR\n\n1. YOUR CAR HESITATES OR SUDDENLY JERKS FORWARD WHILE ACCELERATING\n\nA bad MAF sensor can cause your vehicle to experience poor drivability issues such as engine stalling, jerking or hesitation during acceleration. This could happen while speeding up on the highway on-ramp or cruising down a city street. These issues can create dangerous situations causing accidents and injury. If you experience any of these symptoms you should examine your vehicle as soon as possible.\n\n2. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO RICH\n\nYour vehicle needs the proper ratio of fuel to air in each combustion cylinder. Running rich means there is too much fuel and not enough air. Signs that your vehicle is running rich include:\n\nBlack smoke exiting the tailpipe\nWorse fuel efficiency than usual\nRough idling\nCheck Engine Light\n\n3. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO LEAN\n\nRunning lean is the opposite of running rich. It means your vehicle has too little fuel and too much air. Similar to running rich, the MAF sensor is sending inaccurate information to the PCM. This time underestimating the amount of airflow instead of overestimating it.\nAlthough this will temporarily improve your fuel efficiency, running lean for too long can seriously damage your vehicle. You may experience:\n\nEngine hesitation and/or surging\nHard engine seizures\nHard starting\nCheck Engine Light\n\nAs with other MAF sensor problems, the solution may be as simple as cleaning the wires. However, it\u2019s also a good idea to have a mechanic check your vehicle for damage.\n\n4. YOUR OBD-II SCANNER GETS\u00a0CODE P0101\n\nIf your\u00a0Check Engine Light is on, use a code reader to see what diagnostic trouble codes the system puts your way. If you don\u2019t have a code reader, stop by AutoZone to use our free Fix Finder program.\nThis Code\u2019s full read out is: P0101 \u2013 Mass Air Flow Sensor Circuit Range/Performance.\nThe engine computer uses the MAF sensor signal to determine how much fuel needs to be injected to meet the proper air-fuel ratio. The MAF sensor signal is also used to calculate engine load, meaning it can cause trouble for the traction control system, or change the automatic shifting pattern in applicable vehicles. This code is most commonly caused by a dirty, obstructed, or faulty MAF sensor, but can also be caused by issues including:\n\nDamage to the intake boot\nVacuum leaks\nClogged or improperly installed engine air filter\nClogged-up cat converter or restricted exhaust\n\nBecause there are other potential causes besides the bad MAF sensor, it\u2019s worth looking into these other possibilities so you are positive this code is being caused by the sensor before you go about replacing it.\n\nA malfunctioning MAF sensor may cause your vehicle to jerk during acceleration, run too rich, or run too lean. Make sure to fix the problem right away so you can be safe, avoid costly repairs, save money at the pump, and avoid being stranded on the road. Be sure to take a look at the mass air flow sensor before replacing it, you may only need to clean your MAF. Stop by your local AutoZone for advice on symptoms of a bad MAF sensor.\n\nShop MAF Sensors",

        "title": "How to Upgrade Performance",
        "content": "How to Upgrade to a High Performance\n\n1. Upgrade the Engine\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to look at your engine as a big air pump. The faster and better the air flows through the engine, the faster your car will move. One great upgrade that can help achieve this is a cold air intake system. Brands like Specter and K&N offer high-performance systems that replace the factory air filter and intake housing. This design reduces intake restrictions and allows for a larger amount of air to flow into the engine, resulting in more usable power and better acceleration.\n\n2. Upgrade the Exhaust System\n\nAnother way to increase horsepower is to improve the performance and sound of your exhaust system. Replacing the factory mufflers with high-flow performance mufflers from Flow Master or Magna Flow can make a significant difference. If you\u2019re not comfortable with cutting and welding, a local muffler shop can help with the installation. Another option is a cat-back exhaust system that replaces the factory system from the catalytic converters to the rear of the car. This upgrade can be done with simple hand tools and provides real performance gains.\nA full performance exhaust system can also free up some horsepower. There are two options to choose from \u2013 a bolt-on kit designed to fit your car or a universal kit from Flow Master that you can customize to fit your vehicle. The full system includes mandrel bends to reduce resistance and an option for a crossover pipe or an X pipe for scavenging. You can also choose the performance muffler that best suits your performance goals or desired sound. This is a heavy DIY project that requires cutting and welding, so a local exhaust shop can help if you\u2019re not comfortable with your skills.\n\n3. Upgrade the brakes\n\nIf you want a car that goes fast, then you better make sure it can stop fast, and upgrading your brakes is something that most of us can do. For performance, you want to look at your pads, calipers, and your rotors. And if you want a little extra flare, you can use some custom caliper covers, or go on to the full brake kit.\n\n4. Upgrade Tires & Handling\n\nYou have got to be able to control your car, especially when it\u2019s screaming at the top of its RPM range. You can really improve the handling with some performance tires, and you can get better feedback with a performance steering wheel. Most stock steering wheels are typically a larger diameter; they\u2019re made from molded plastic, and they can be hard to hang on to in extreme conditions. A smaller diameter wheel, covered in leather or suede give you better feedback, a better grip, and better car control.\n\n5. Upgrade fluids and chemicals\n\nHigh performance means high heat, and if you\u2019re dealing with high heat, you\u2019ve got to go with synthetic. One of the best benefits of synthetic oil is that the oil itself doesn\u2019t break down as fast. The viscosity stays the same for a longer period of time, and especially under extreme conditions. But it\u2019s not just your engine oil. Synthetic and performance fluids throughout your vehicle can free up horsepower with less friction, and better protect your parts under stress, all at the same time. \n\n6. Reprogram the system\n\nPower programmers are a simple and proven way to really wake up your car, providing power gains up to 30 horsepower or even more in some diesel applications. They use a data cable that connects the programmer to your car\u2019s computer by plugging into the car\u2019s diagnostic port of a \u201996 and newer vehicle. A programmer can access and change tuning data that controls air and fuel into your engine, timing events, even transmission shift points, and line pressures to give you more power and a better performance feel, better towing, and even better fuel economy, depending on how the programmer is set.",

        "content": "Which Cold Air Intake is Right for You?\n\n1. Plastic or Metal Air Intake Tube?\n\nAir intake tubes are made from either plastic, resin (or carbon fiber), or metal \u2013 usually aluminum. Plastic intake tubes are typically quieter, while metal air intake tubes look flashier in various colors or finishes. Typically, metal intake tubes will tend to hold heat longer than plastic, even though aluminum by far dissipates heat far better than steel.\n\n2. Oiled or Dry Air Filter?\n\nCold air intake systems come with oiled or dry air filters. Oiled filters are covered with a thin layer of oil to trap dirt. Dry filters rely on layers of cotton gauze or synthetic fabric, to keep out contaminants. Oiled air filters are reusable and long-lasting.\nYou can drive close to 50,000 miles before an oiled air filter ever needs cleaning under normal road driving conditions. Cleaning is just a bath of warm soapy water and reapplication of oil. Dry filters don\u2019t require cleaning, but cannot be reused. You\u2019ll need to replace the filter after 15,000 to 30,000 miles or as the manufacturer suggests. Read and follow recommendations on the package. Note \u2013 over-oiling of an oiled filter can lead to Mass Airflow sensor (MAF) failure, so it\u2019s important to be careful when servicing an oiled filter.\n\n3. Which Brand to Buy?\n\nMost systems will work for any vehicle, but when in doubt, it\u2019s a good idea to choose a cold air intake system from a brand that caters to your vehicle type. K&N has produced cold air intake systems for decades, and it\u2019s one of the most popular brands of cold air intake systems thanks to extensive coverage.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to start searching for a new intake, browse online or talk to a store associate at your local AutoZone.",

        "title": "Best Antifreeze for 2024",
        "content": "Introduction to Antifreeze\n\nAntifreeze, also known as engine coolant, plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and performance of your vehicle\u2019s engine. Antifreeze serves a few purposes:\n\nIt prevents your engine from freezing in cold temperatures\nIt protects it from overheating in hot weather\nIt resists corrosion inside the cooling system\n\nAs the coolant passes through the cooling system circuit, it absorbs heat in the engine that\u2019s produced by combustion. Next, it flows through the heater core, and if there\u2019s demand for warm air inside the car, it\u2019s the coolant that delivers it. Then, the water pump circulates it to the radiator where heat is released into the atmosphere.\nAll coolant contains a mixture of water and glycol as well as specialized additives. The water is effectively a conductor to transfer heat, whereas the glycol serves to prevent freezing in the winter and raises the boiling point in the summer. Additives are primarily for corrosion protection, ensuring the cooling system doesn\u2019t rust on the inside.\n\nChoosing the Right Antifreeze for Your Vehicle\n\nMixing different antifreeze formulations can lead to adverse reactions, compromising the effectiveness of the coolant. It\u2019s crucial to adhere to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines regarding mixing antifreeze to prevent potential damage to your engine. Seldom can you combine two different antifreeze chemistries and get the protective benefits you need. There can be compatibility issues including gelling or corrosion, so always use the correct type for your engine. Coolants specify what they\u2019re meant to be used for, including domestic vehicles, European vehicles, and Asian models.\nAutoZone provides customers with choices between long-life and traditional antifreeze options. Long-life antifreeze is formulated to last for an extended period, often up to 150,000 miles or more, reducing the frequency of coolant changes. Traditional antifreeze, on the other hand, requires more frequent replacements.\nWhile long-life antifreeze may be cost-effective in the long run, traditional antifreeze options often come at a lower upfront cost. We will weigh the pros and cons of each option, helping you make an informed decision based on your vehicle\u2019s needs and your maintenance preferences.\n\nFactors to Consider When Purchasing Antifreeze\n\nClimate plays a pivotal role in determining the type of antifreeze your vehicle requires. Cold weather antifreeze is designed to prevent freezing in low temperatures, ensuring that your coolant won\u2019t expand and crack the block, even during the coldest months. In contrast, hot weather antifreeze focuses on dissipating heat efficiently to prevent overheating during scorching summer days.\nDifferent ratios are available depending on your needs. For example, in extreme cold, you won\u2019t want to use anything weaker than a 50-50 blend of antifreeze and water, giving you freeze protection to -40F or even colder. But in more temperate climates, a 70-30 mix of water to coolant offer all the protection you need from the cold while being even better at dispersing heat.\nWhile the terms \u201cantifreeze\u201d and \u201ccoolant\u201d are often used interchangeably, it\u2019s crucial to recognize the subtle distinctions between the two. Antifreeze primarily prevents freezing, while coolant encompasses a broader range of functions, including heat dissipation and corrosion prevention.\n\nTop Antifreeze Brands of 2024\n\nAutoZone offers a comprehensive selection of antifreeze and coolants to address various engine requirements.

        "title": "What You Need to Know About Antifreeze and Coolant",
        "content": "Antifreeze vs. Coolant: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nThe confusion between antifreeze and coolant comes up due to their shared purpose within your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. Antifreeze is a concentrated solution that primarily consists of either ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, mixed with water. For most vehicles and geographic regions, it\u2019s a 50-50 mix. It serves as the base fluid that helps regulate your engine\u2019s temperature.\nCoolant, on the other hand, is a mixture of antifreeze and water in the right proportions, ready to be poured directly into your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. In essence, coolant is antifreeze with added water, making it a ready-to-use solution. So, to answer the common question: Is coolant and antifreeze the same thing? Not quite, but they are closely related.\nAntifreeze is aptly named for its ability to prevent freezing in cold temperatures. It lowers the freezing point of water, ensuring that the liquid in your engine\u2019s cooling system remains fluid, even in frigid conditions. This prevents your engine block and radiator from cracking due to freezing water expansion.\nCoolant, on the other hand, serves a dual purpose. In addition to preventing freezing, it also raises the boiling point of the liquid in your cooling system. This is crucial for preventing overheating in hot weather or during heavy engine use. It works by efficiently transferring heat away from the engine to the radiator, where it can be dissipated.\n\nThe Importance of Antifreeze/Coolant: Protecting Your Engine\n\nOne of the primary functions of your vehicle\u2019s cooling system is to regulate the temperature of your engine. When your engine gets too hot, it can lead to severe damage, including warped cylinder heads, blown head gaskets, and more. Antifreeze and coolant play a pivotal role in preventing such overheating by maintaining the optimal operating temperature range.\nBut there\u2019s more to it than that. Another crucial role of antifreeze and coolant is preventing corrosion and rust within your cooling system. Over time, metal components can deteriorate due to exposure to oxygen and moisture. The additives in antifreeze and coolant help protect these components, extending the lifespan of your engine.\n\nTypes of Antifreeze/Coolant: Which One is Right for Your Vehicle?\n\nThere are two primary types of antifreeze: ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is the most common type and provides excellent freeze and boil protection. However, it\u2019s toxic and requires careful handling.\nPropylene glycol, on the other hand, is less toxic and considered safer for the environment. It provides similar freeze and boil protection but may require more frequent changes.\n\nAnd with both coolant and antifreeze, always choose a product that\u2019s compatible with your vehicle. Different chemistries are available including:\n\nInorganic Additive Technology (IAT)\nOrganic Acid Technology (OAT)\nHybrid Organic Acid Technology (HOAT)\nPhosphated Hybrid Organic Acid Technology (P-HOAT)\nSilicated Hybrid Organic Acid Technology (Si-OAT)\n\nOne of the best ways to ensure you get the right type is to check the color. As well, look on the product label to make sure it\u2019s intended for your vehicle make.\n\nHow to Check and Maintain Your Antifreeze/Coolant Levels\n\nProper maintenance of antifreeze and coolant levels is vital for your vehicle\u2019s health, and to make sure it lasts as long as possible. Periodically check the level in your overflow or radiator reservoir. Ensure it\u2019s between the MIN and MAX markings. Also, inspect the color \u2013 it should match the coolant you\u2019re using. If it\u2019s murky or discolored, it\u2019s time for a change.\n\nAdding or Replacing Antifreeze/Coolant\n\nIf your coolant level is low or you notice issues like overheating, it\u2019s time to add more coolant. To do this, ensure your engine is cool, and slowly pour the appropriate coolant mix into the radiator or reservoir. If a complete change is necessary, perform a coolant flush to ensure all the old fluid is removed before adding the new mixture.\nWhen you need coolant for your vehicle, shop at your local AutoZone. Explore products that are perfectly suited for your car, truck, SUV, or van from some of the most trusted names in auto parts.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Causes Coolant Leaks?",
        "content": "Importance of the Cooling System\n\nLet\u2019s understand why the cooling system is so crucial for your vehicle\u2019s well-being. The engine in your car generates an immense amount of heat during its operation. If this heat isn\u2019t managed properly, it can lead to severe damage and even engine failure. This is where the cooling system comes into play.\nThe cooling system\u2019s primary function is to regulate the engine\u2019s temperature, preventing it from getting too hot. It does this by circulating coolant, also known as antifreeze, through a series of components, dissipating excess heat and maintaining the engine\u2019s optimal operating temperature.\n\nOverview of the Cooling System\n\nTo better grasp the causes of coolant leaks, it\u2019s essential to understand the various components of the cooling system:\n\nRadiator. The radiator is one of the central components of the cooling system. It\u2019s essentially a heat exchanger that allows coolant to release heat and cool down before it\u2019s recirculated through the engine.\nWater pump. The water pump is responsible for circulating coolant throughout the engine and the radiator. It\u2019s often driven by a belt connected to the engine\u2019s crankshaft.\nThermostat. It acts as a gatekeeper, regulating the flow of coolant into the radiator. The thermostat opens and closes to maintain the engine\u2019s optimal temperature.\nHoses. Hoses connect various parts of the cooling system, ensuring a continuous flow of coolant. They are typically made of reinforced rubber or silicone and are prone to wear and tear over time.\nHeater core. The heater core is a small radiator-like unit that provides heat for the cabin when you turn on the heater. It\u2019s also part of the cooling system.\n\nCommon Symptoms of Coolant Leaks\n\nArmed with a basic understanding of the cooling system\u2019s components, let\u2019s explore the common symptoms of coolant leaks that you should watch out for.\n\nLow coolant level\n\nPerhaps the most obvious sign of a coolant leak is a consistently low coolant level in your reservoir or radiator. If you find yourself frequently topping off the coolant, it\u2019s a clear indication that there\u2019s a leak somewhere in the system.\n\nDamaged radiator\n\nA damaged radiator can be a source of coolant leaks. Look for visible cracks, holes, or corrosion on the radiator. In some cases, a damaged radiator can be repaired, but it\u2019s often more cost-effective to replace it.\n\nVisual inspection\n\nPerforming a visual inspection of your engine bay can sometimes reveal coolant leaks. Look for damp or discolored spots around hoses, the water pump, the radiator, and the heater core. Green, orange, or pink stains are indicative of coolant leaks.\n\nEngine overheating\n\nIf your engine is consistently running hotter than normal, it could be due to a coolant leak. When the coolant level drops too low, the engine doesn\u2019t receive adequate cooling, leading to overheating. This can cause severe engine damage if left unaddressed.\n\nHow to Fix Small Coolant Leaks\n\nAddressing coolant leaks promptly is essential to prevent further damage to your vehicle and avoid costly repairs down the road. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to fix small coolant leaks:\n\nIdentify the source. The first step is to pinpoint the source of the coolant leak. Carefully inspect the engine bay and all cooling system components, paying close attention to hoses, the radiator, water pump, and heater core. Look for visible signs of damage or leaks.\nTighten hose clamps. If you find that a hose connection is loose, simply tightening the hose clamps might solve the issue. Use a screwdriver or pliers to secure the clamps snugly, but be careful not to overtighten, as this can damage the hose.\nUse a sealant product. For small leaks in hoses or the radiator, you can use a coolant system sealant or repair kit. Follow the product instructions carefully. These sealants can temporarily patch small leaks, but it\u2019s crucial to monitor the system and plan for a more permanent repair or replacement in the future.\nReplace leaking or collapsed hoses. If you discover that a hose is damaged or has a significant leak, it\u2019s best to replace it. Hoses are relatively inexpensive, and a new one can prevent further coolant leaks and potential engine damage.\nReplace the radiator. For more extensive radiator damage, it may be necessary to replace it altogether.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about the source of the coolant leak or if the issue persists after attempting repairs, it\u2019s advisable to consult a professional mechanic. They can perform a thorough inspection, diagnose the problem accurately, and recommend the necessary repairs.\nRegularly inspecting your cooling system for signs of leaks and addressing small issues promptly can save you from more extensive and costly repairs in the future. Remember that the cooling system is an integral part of your vehicle, and neglecting coolant leaks can lead to engine overheating and severe damage.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Understanding Antifreeze Colors\n\nSince different manufacturers use different materials \u2013 and even different generations of the same model are manufactured in unique ways \u2013 the coolant required isn\u2019t universal. Chemistries used include Inorganic Additive Technology (IAT), Organic Acid Technology (OAT), and a few different Hybrid Organic Acid Technology (HOAT) options. These specify the type of corrosion inhibitors used in the formulation, and they\u2019re designed to prevent a reaction with the different materials used to construct the engine and cooling system.\nTo tell the varieties apart, there\u2019s an assortment of antifreeze colors. And while the colors aren\u2019t regulated in the industry, checking the color along with the vehicle compatibility together can help ensure you get the right option.\n\nCommon Antifreeze Colors and Their Meanings\n\nFor each coolant color, you\u2019ll be able to associate the vehicles that they\u2019re generally compatible with. And the additives and corrosion inhibitors in each are designed to prevent chemical reactions that can cause blockages or make the coolant acidic years before it\u2019s due to be changed.\nCheck out this antifreeze color chart for common colors, types, and compatible brands.\n\nCoolant TypeColorInhibitor TechnologyCompatible With\u2026Inorganic Additive Technology (IAT)GreenSilicatesOlder vehicles, domestic and importOrganic Acid Technology (OAT)OrangeOrganic AcidsGeneral Motors, VW, SaabHybrid OAT (HOAT)YellowSilicates & Organic AcidsFord, Stellantis, and European MakesHybrid OAT, Phosphate-Free (HOAT)TurquoiseNitrite, Amine, Phosphate, and Silicate-FreeBMW, Volvo, Tesla, MINIPhosphated HOAT (P-HOAT)Pink or BluePhosphates and Organic AcidsToyota, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, and other Asian MakesSilicated HOAT (S-HOAT)PurpleSilicates and Organic AcidsAudi, VW, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz\n\nCompatibility and Recommendations\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s recommended to always stick with the same coolant type and color that your vehicle was filled with from the manufacturer. Engineers have ensured that the blend of inhibitors is the least reactive to the metals and other substances the coolant contacts, ensuring it will protect your cooling system from corrosion.\nIf you need to top up the coolant, use a premixed coolant of the same type and color. And if you don\u2019t have access to the same type, find one of the many universal coolants available that\u2019s safe to mix with. A universal coolant may not be the same color, but it won\u2019t react negatively in your engine, carrying you through to your next repair or cooling system service.\n\nPotential Consequences of Using Incompatible Antifreeze\n\nMixing incompatible antifreeze types can lead to chemical reactions that may cause the formation of deposits, clogging, and reduced heat transfer efficiency. Over time, that can lead to issues like poor flow through the radiator, damage to the water pump impeller, and a thermostat that won\u2019t fully close or open.\nAs well, using the appropriate antifreeze helps maintain optimal engine performance by preventing overheating, freezing, and corrosion within the cooling system. By sticking with to your vehicle manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, you can avoid potential damage, costly repairs, and ensure that your engine remains protected and efficient throughout its lifespan.",

You can find this information in your vehicle owner\u2019s manual.\nDistilled water.\nA funnel.\nA heavy cloth or rag.\nWork gloves.\nEye protection.\n\nHow to Add Antifreeze to Your Engine\n\nCaution: Do not attempt to remove the radiator cap or coolant fluid reservoir cap while the engine is running or it\u2019s hot. Steam or hot coolant can escape under pressure and cause serious burns to you or someone nearby. Wait until the engine has cooled down to remove the radiator cap, which usually takes around 30 minutes to an hour after turning off the engine.\n\n1. Locate the fill cap\n\nUnder the hood, identify where you should add coolant. If your radiator has a cap directly on it, or it\u2019s on a filler neck nearby, that\u2019s the best choice. Also, note if there\u2019s a reservoir mounted to the side. It might have a pressure cap on it, or it could be a simple flip cap too. If you don\u2019t have a radiator cap but there\u2019s a reservoir, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll add the fluid.\n\n2. Remove the radiator or coolant reservoir cap\n\nExtreme caution should be exercised in this step. Wear eye protection and gloves as well as a long-sleeved jacket to protect yourself in case hot coolant sprays out. \nWith the engine cooled down, place your rag over the cap and slowly turn the coolant cap counterclockwise. You may hear pressure hiss or a slight suction noise. If you do, pause until it dissipates. If coolant begins to bubble out, quickly close the cap or step away. Take the cap completely off when the noises are gone.\n\n3. Mix the coolant (if required)\n\nYou have two types of coolant you can use: pre-mixed or concentrated. With pre-mixed, the engine coolant is diluted 50-50 with water already. If you choose concentrated, you\u2019ll need to do this mixture yourself with distilled water.\n\n4. Identify the fill level and add coolant\n\nIf you\u2019re filling the radiator, add coolant until it\u2019s completely full, just below the rim of the filler neck. On the reservoir, identify the markings for FULL and LOW that are stamped in the plastic. There may also be indications for HOT and COLD. With a cold engine, add coolant to the FULL or COLD mark.\nTo get rid of as much air as you can during the fill, squeeze the upper radiator hose to \u2018burp\u2019 the system. Repeat it a few times until there aren\u2019t any air bubbles heard or felt in the hose.\n\n5. Install the cap\n\nInstall the coolant cap on the reservoir or radiator, ensuring that it\u2019s tightened completely by twisting clockwise.\n\n6. Bleed the air from the cooling system (if required)\n\nAt this point, run the engine until it\u2019s at operating temperature. The temperature should stay within the normal range. If, in the unusual circumstance that it spikes to the red zone on the gauge or you get an \u2018ENGINE HOT\u2019 message, there could be an airlock. Consult a service manual to determine the best way to get rid of an airlock for your vehicle.\n\nTips to Keep Your Antifreeze Full in the Engine\n\nHow can you ensure your engine\u2019s antifreeze level stays in a good range? First and foremost, follow your car maintenance guide for cooling system services and inspections. You should check your coolant at least every oil change and top it off if necessary.\u00a0\nAlso, if you notice a coolant leak, pay close attention to the fluid level until the leak is resolved.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Antifreeze Buying Guide: Choosing the Right Coolant",
        "content": "The Types of Antifreeze\n\nEach brand has its own lineup of antifreeze or coolant products in the automotive market. Generally, there are three coolant chemistries that each will fit into. They include:\n\nIAT coolant. Your conventional, green coolant that many DIYers are familiar with is known as an Inorganic Additive Technology, or IAT coolant. The base fluid is ethylene glycol, containing corrosion inhibitors that are considered not organic, such as silicates.\u00a0\nOAT coolant. No, there aren\u2019t any cereals involved in OAT coolant. It stands for Organic Acid Technology, and, as the name states, it uses organic acids instead of traditional inorganic inhibitors to resist corrosion. It has a longer service life and is more environmentally friendly.\u00a0\n\nHOAT coolant. Hybrid Organic Acid Technology, or HOAT coolants, combines the best aspects of both conventional and long-life OAT coolants. It provides the best protection against corrosion and overheating and can be used in a wide range of vehicles, especially those that use aluminum components.\n\nAmong HOAT coolants, there are some differences to consider too. There are phosphate-free, phosphated, and silicated options, and it\u2019s all about differing inhibitor technology based on what each manufacturer recommends for their vehicles.\n\nChoosing the Right Type of Antifreeze\nWhat color of antifreeze should you choose? It seems like there\u2019s a rainbow\u2019s worth of options on the market for coolant, but each has its purpose. When choosing the right engine coolant for you, whether to top up the antifreeze during your car maintenance or flush and fill the radiator and cooling system, the type you choose matters.\nIf you add an incompatible coolant to your engine, there could be a chemical reaction that forms deposits or causes the coolant to gel and clog the system. It might not contain the best corrosion inhibitors for your engine, leading to rust and contamination. It can even lead to engine damage or cooling performance issues that are much longer lasting than just changing the coolant again.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the applications for the different coolant types:\n\nIAT coolant \u2013 older vehicles across all makes and models, typically around 2001 and older. The common color of this coolant is green.\nOAT coolant \u2013 General Motors, Saab, and Volkswagen vehicles. They\u2019re usually orange but can also be dark green, red, pink, yellow, or purple, depending on the coolant brand.\nHOAT coolant \u2013 Commonly yellow coolant, it\u2019s intended for Ford, Chrysler, and many European brands.\nPhosphate-free HOAT coolant \u2013 It\u2019s used primarily by BMW, Volvo, Tesla, and MINI. The coolant color is typically turquoise.\u00a0\nPhosphated HOAT coolant is a common coolant chosen by popular Asian brands like Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, and Mazda. It\u2019s often pink or blue in color.\u00a0\nSilicated HOAT coolant \u2013 You\u2019ll use this purple coolant for high-performance European models like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, and some VW models.\n\nKeep in mind that the color of the coolant is not important. The coolant selection must specify that it\u2019s intended for your application to avoid compatibility problems.\n\nHelpful Antifreeze Articles\n\nHow often Should You Replace Engine Coolant?\n\nReplacing your engine coolant is an important maintenance task that should not be neglected. But how often should it be done? It depends on a few factors, but here\u2019s a general guideline to help you keep your engine in top shape.\nMost manufacturers recommend replacing engine coolant approximately every 100,000 miles or every five years, whichever comes first. Certain coolants report being good for up to 160,000 miles or five years. However, if you drive in harsh conditions, such as hot weather or heavy traffic, you may need to replace the coolant more frequently. Your best bet is to follow the interval recommended by the manufacturer and use the correct type for your vehicle.\nIt\u2019s also important to keep an eye on the coolant level and appearance. If the coolant becomes dirty or discolored, it\u2019s time to flush and refill the system. And if you notice a sweet, syrupy smell under the hood, this could be a sign of a coolant leak, and you should have it inspected immediately.\nReplacing your engine coolant is a crucial aspect of maintaining the health of your vehicle. Don\u2019t neglect it \u2013 it\u2019s a relatively quick and inexpensive task that can save you from costly repairs down the road. So, keep an eye on the odometer, check your coolant regularly, and always follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for the best results.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Your Antifreeze/Coolant Questions Answered",
        "content": "What Kind of Engine Coolant\u00a0Should I Use?\n\nAntifreeze is really divided into 2 different types \u2013 IAT and OAT antifreeze. IAT (inorganic acid technology) antifreeze is the green antifreeze of old, and the universal standard for over 70 years. During the late 80\u2019s, cars began using more and more aluminum parts in engines, and the need to come up with a better, longer lasting antifreeze led to OAT (organic acid technology) antifreeze. While any IAT green antifreeze can be mixed with other green, mixing OAT antifreeze with other types is not recommended. Many manufacturers developed their own blend of OAT antifreeze, with less of more silicates and phosphates, and in doing so, developed a specific color of antifreeze to identify it. You should check your owner\u2019s manual, to check on what type or color of antifreeze your car takes. One of the most common, and longstanding coolants of this type is DEX COOL\u00ae, which was developed by GM in the late 1980\u2019s and has been used ever since. You can find out more about the\u00a0history and details of different types of antifreeze here!\nOf course, there are specialty formulas available, and understanding the options there could make your car ownership experience a lot better. Some examples of special variants you might find useful under the right circumstances include:\nCold weather protection to -34 degrees is available from many manufacturersAntifreeze that is non-toxic to animals is also very popularSome coolant manufacturers offer extreme heat formulas similar to their cold weather options\nIn the end, as long as you are choosing a formula that is compatible with your vehicle, what\u00a0antifreeze\u00a0to use is largely dependent on your needs.\n\nWhat Kind of Coolant\u00a0Does My Car Need?\n\nAre Basic Antifreeze Formulas\u00a0the Same?\n\nPrestine and BlueDevil Antifreeze\nAlmost every antifreeze chosen by OE designers is 95 percent ethylene glycol, but the additives vary a lot from manufacturer to manufacturer and provide each brand and variant with its unique characteristics. The practice of following the recommendations is one of using the antifreeze that tested best under controlled conditions.\n\nHow Often Do I Need To\u00a0Change My Coolant?\n\nA full coolant replacement is generally recommended every three to five years or 100,000 \u2013 150,000 miles by manufacturers, depending on the model, but sometimes these intervals are shorter for older automobiles. OAT antifreeze was formulated to have a much longer life than IAT antifreeze. You can check the specific gravity and color of your coolant to see if it is time. You\u2019ll need a\u202ftest kit\u202fto do it yourself. Most of the time, coolant is good longer than the estimate in the owner\u2019s manual, but sometimes it breaks down early and you lose performance. That\u2019s why regular checks on the coolant will serve you better than an estimate in time or miles. You can get a longer lifespan out of extended life varieties, with some formulas boasting life expectancies as high as five years. If you are curious about extended life varieties, check out whether your manufacturer has made any recommendations about a maximum life formula in addition to the OEM one.\n\nDo I Need To\u00a0Add Coolant Regularly?\n\nHow to flush and fill your coolant\nIn an ideal world, no. Theoretically your coolant system should be self-contained, reusing the same fluid until it breaks down enough you need to change it. The way things usually work, though is that the system has an\u202foverflow tank\u202ffor a reason, and sometimes it overflows. If the level is slightly too high at a a normal temperature you should be fine. If you\u2019re in extreme heat and temperatures get slightly above optimal, you could also lose coolant you normally depend on due to volume changes.\nChecking the coolant on a regular basis will tell you whether you need to add it, as well as how well it is working. Most people will find they only rarely have to add coolant when a vehicle is new, but as cars age many start to have lower efficiency cooling systems. Preventive maintenance and good upkeep in general can both help slow down this process, and a full vehicle restoration can turn back the clock if you are dedicated to preserving a vehicle.\n\nDoes Antifreeze\u00a0Do Anything Else?\n\nYes! Besides cooling your car\u2019s engine and keeping it from freezing, antifreeze acts as a liquid that resists corrosion, whereas pure water would corrode engine parts and not properly lubricate the moving water pump. That\u2019s why you should always use the mixture recommended in your manual, and why it\u2019s important to keep the coolant at optimal levels.\n\nThe Car Is Losing Antifreeze?\u00a0Is There a Leak?\n\nThere are many reasons a vehicle could lose antifreeze, including overflow and evaporation if a cap is loose. If you continue to lose a steady amount of coolant, check carefully around the engine compartment for drips and leaks, and find the front of the water pump to check if the water pump itself is leaking. If you want to find where you\u2019re leaking from, a drop cloth under the vehicle can help pinpoint the leak because it will show a stain where the antifreeze drips. If no leak is found, this is normally a sign of a\u00a0head gasket leak\u00a0that could be leaking coolant into either the combustion chamber or into the oil itself. Either way, the system should be properly pressure-tested and checked for leaks, and a head gasket / internal leak.\nConsulting a professional for hard to pinpoint leaks can save you time, but coolant system diagnostic guides are out there for the dedicated do-it-yourself enthusiast. Remember to follow all the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for replacement, including the replacement of\u202fhoses\u202fand valves at the recommended times. This will help prevent leaks from developing, and it\u2019s much easier than troubleshooting the system for a bad seal or a leaky hose. The best part is, refreshing the system will help it hold on to that efficiency new cars have, so it\u2019s easier to ask your engine to perform at a higher level for longer.

        "title": "Understanding Different Types of Antifreeze",
        "content": "Types of Antifreeze\n\nThe first thing to understand is the different basis for certain types of antifreeze.\nTraditional antifreeze (the old green stuff) is known as IAT antifreeze, which refers to Inorganic Acid Technology. It was fortified with silicates and phosphates, which were used primarily to keep corrosion down within the system. This was especially important when the primary item that coolant was protecting from was rust in cast iron in engine blocks, heads, and other engine components in the cooling system made from iron.\nDuring the 1980\u2019s \u2013 as more and more vehicles began to use aluminum parts and rubber seals in the system, more problems began to occur. For example, silicates caused massive amounts of scale in the system when in contact with aluminum, further causing cooling issues. Phosphates on the other hand, over time, dried and corroded anything rubber \u2013 like water pump seals. The life of IAT antifreeze breaks down heavily around 36,000 miles in the system, causing massive corrosive issues once the coolant begins to break down. It breaks down so bad, that it can even begin to conduct electricity through electrolysis and begin eating your system from the inside! Because of this, European and Japanese manufacturers began working on OAT, or Organic Acid Technology Antifreeze.\nOAT antifreeze has a replacement interval of 150,000 miles or generally 5-7 years, and depending on the make, is either silicate free, phosphate free, or both. OAT antifreeze began in the American market with GM\u2019s introduction to Dexcool Orange in 1994. Other manufacturers began tweaking and making OAT coolant better through technology \u2013 providing coolant that was either safer for the environment, had even better anti-corrosion capability, or even had change intervals as long as 10 years.\nThese coolants, either Subaru Blue, Toyota Red, or VW / Audi G12, which is Purple, are the reasons why sticking with the factory-spec\u2019d coolant intended for the vehicle is highly recommended over going with an \u201call makes\u201d coolant \u2013 it is far superior. These colors added by the manufacturer are more-or-less markers to tell you first and foremost, what is in your system currently, and second, an easy identifier to tell you what the right coolant is, and that you are adding the right stuff to the system. For instance, if the reservoir of your VW you see purple, and you\u2019re adding a VW specific purple coolant, it makes it very easy to see that everything is good! All coolant of this variety is either silicate free, phosphate free, or both, and is designed specifically to meet the needs of that particular manufacturers\u2019 testing.\n\nWhat Are \u201cAll Makes\u201d Coolants?\n\nSo what exactly are the \u201call makes\u201d coolants? They are HOAT \u2013 Hybrid Organic Acid Technology. This is an Antifreeze where manufacturers use Nitrates to literally make a \u201ctweener\u201d antifreeze \u2013 that\u2019s something in between IAT and OAT \u2013 meaning, it\u2019s a jack of all trades, and a master of none. It works, and is a great alternative in a pinch, but there are better methods and options for the customer if their vehicle requires a specific antifreeze \u2013 like the Pentosin and Peak manufacturer-specific antifreezes on the market. Mixing traditional IAT (green) antifreeze with an OAT antifreeze can also cause a world of problems. In the late 90\u2019s, Dexcool, GM\u2019s new OAT Antifreeze suffered this wrath and for a while, garnered a horrible reputation because unknowing customers were mixing traditional green IAT antifreeze into their Dexcool systems, eventually creating a brown nasty sludge over time that many consumers faulted Dexcool for. Dexcool was not the problem.\nBesides the type of antifreeze you decide to use, there are some very important points that are worth educating yourself on:\nAll antifreeze breaks down \u2013 whether it\u2019s 36,000 miles with IAT, or 5, 7, 10 years or 150,000 miles \u2013 it must be changed and flushed at some point. If you are unsure whether it\u2019s been flushed, it probably hasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a good idea to change.\nYour heater core is the most neglected item in the flush. Heater cores fail from one thing \u2013 corrosion from within. During the summer months, your heater circuit is shut off from regular circulation in the car\u2019s cooling system, and the bottom of the heater core becomes a sediment pool and the source of corrosion. Your heater core can be flushed directly by simply running your hose-flush through the heater hose and into the heater core. Many customers who do this report nasty, brown sludge coming out of the heater core, or sometimes, complete blockage from debris and sediment. Remember, affording a $50.00 flush isn\u2019t bad. A $1,200.00 heater core job really hurts.\nThe only universal part of coolant is water \u2013 different coolant types should never be mixed. Some studies show that mixing IAT and OAT antifreeze actually caused more corrosion than water alone (remember the GM Dexcool issue above!). If you are unsure what antifreeze is in your system, the antifreeze is brown, an off-color from what is recommended, or what has been put in is an HOAT \u201call makes\u201d antifreeze, the best option is to plan a flush as soon as possible.",

        "title": "How To Find and Fix Coolant Leaks",
        "content": "Understanding Coolant Leaks\n\nCoolant is an essential fluid. That is, if you do not have the right amount of fluid, you are asking for serious trouble that may include substantial engine damage. As such, you should routinely check your car\u2019s coolant levels. If you regularly find that you are adding new fluid to your system, there is a good chance you have a coolant leak.\n\nHow to Detect Coolant Leaks\n\nCOMMON SOURCES OF COOLANT LEAKS\n\n1. A BLOWN HEAD GASKET\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s head gasket seals the space between its\u00a0cylinder head\u00a0and engine block. If the head gasket fails, coolant, and engine oil may mix. You may also notice that coolant is leaking from the bottom of the engine and dripping onto the ground. Either way, a blown head gasket can be disastrous for your engine.\n\n2. A DAMAGED HEATER CORE\n\nYour\u00a0heater core\u00a0is essentially a small radiator that disperses heat into your vehicle\u2019s passenger cabin. While you cannot see the heater core, it may develop a coolant leak. If it does, fluid may accumulate in the plastic housing on the bottom of the heater core.\n\n3. A CRACKED OR DAMAGED HOSE\n\nCoolant may move through many\u00a0different hoses\u00a0under your vehicle\u2019s hood. If one of these hoses develops a crack or hole, coolant may leak.\n\n4. LOOSE OR WORN-OUT HOSE CONNECTIONS\n\nHoses in your vehicle\u2019s cooling system must connect to different components. Some connections may have\u00a0hose clamps, while others may attach on their own. Any place a hose connects, though, is prone to springing a coolant leak.\n\n5. A BROKEN RADIATOR\n\nModern coolant has anti-corrosive agents that help protect your radiator from damage. Still, sometimes radiators develop holes. If your vehicle\u2019s radiator has one, you may notice a leak in front of your engine.\n\nCoolant leaks are serious business any time of the year. That is, even though coolant is commonly called antifreeze, it is essential year-round. Therefore, if you have a car leaking coolant, you must take the leak seriously. Fortunately, finding a coolant leak may not be as difficult as you may think.\n\nFinding Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nOften, finding a coolant leak is simple, as you can see fluid dripping from beneath your vehicle\u2019s hood. You may also notice bubbles in the\u00a0coolant reservoir\u00a0or at a hose connection. You must be careful when checking fluid levels, though. If the engine is not completely cool before you remove the radiator cap, you may suffer a serious burn from escaping steam or hot coolant. Therefore, you should never open the radiator cap or the coolant reservoir when your car\u2019s engine is hot.\nTypically, a coolant leak presents itself in just a few ways. For example, your vehicle\u2019s engine may overheat. If this happens, the\u00a0temperature gauge\u00a0on your instrument panel is likely to move upward, perhaps into the red zone. You may also notice steam coming from under your hood. Or, your vehicle may stall. If your car has a low-coolant indicator light, it may also illuminate.\nTo locate a coolant leak, first look for puddles of coolant beneath your vehicle. If you see any, you probably have fluid dripping from somewhere in the system. With the car\u2019s engine running, look under the hood to see if you notice any fluid flowing out. If you do, trace the fluid to its source. Do not forget to check hose connections and components for leaks. Allowing your vehicle to climb to normal operating temperature and turning on the air conditioner increases pressure in your coolant system. This procedure may allow you to more easily detect a coolant leak.\nIf you cannot see a leak but you are losing coolant, you may need to perform a\u00a0coolant pressure test. A pressure tester is a hand-held tool that allows you to gauge the pressure inside your cooling system. If you have low pressure, you probably have a leak somewhere.\n\nFixing Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nThe best way to fix a coolant leak is to track down the location of the leak and repair the old, damaged, or ineffective part. For example, if you have a cracked hose, replacing it is the most effective way to\u00a0stop your leak. Some components naturally wear out over time. As such, replacing hoses, the\u00a0radiator cap, or the reservoir tank may eventually become necessary on older vehicles.\nYou certainly should keep an eye on hose clamps. With ordinary engine movement, clamps can work their way loose. Checking to see that clamps are always sufficiently tight may prevent a leak from forming in the first place.\nIf your leak is because of something more serious, such as a\u00a0blown head gasket, your fix is not so simple. While replacing a bad head gasket is the best way to go in the longterm, such a replacement is very labor intensive and expensive, and you may be able to use a\u00a0sealant\u00a0for less serious cracks or breaks. Sealant products may also work for holes in the radiator. If you are looking at a costly repair or replacing, trying a sealant first may be the way to go.\n\nFinishing Your\u00a0Project\n\nEven though you may never want to have to deal with a car leaking coolant, the problem is more common than you may think. You cannot ignore coolant leaks or any other issue with your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. Now that you understand how to find and fix coolant leaks, you are ready to tackle your project. To finish it successfully, always choose\u00a0high-quality replacement parts\u00a0and the right coolant for your vehicle. With some planning and a bit of effort, you can stop your vehicle\u2019s coolant leak and extend the life of its engine. \nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How to Fix a Radiator Leak",
        "content": "Signs of a Radiator Leak\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to check for signs of a leaking radiator. A small leak may be difficult to notice at first, but a major leak should be easy to identify. Here are the common signs of a radiator leak to watch out for:\n\nRising temperature gauge\nPuddles of green or orange coolant under your vehicle\nLow coolant reservoir\nDiscoloration or rust in your engine bay\n\nA rising temperature gauge is one of the easiest signs to spot. A slightly higher temperature may be caused by other issues or by a minor leak, but if your engine temperature climbs too high you should avoid driving your vehicle. Driving while your temperature gauge is too high could damage your engine and create additional costly repair issues.\nInspect any puddles under your vehicle. One of the most common sources of liquid dripping from your vehicle is your air conditioner. Condensation naturally forms as your AC is operating, so this isn\u2019t a cause for concern. Any yellowish or black colored liquid could be motor oil, and an orange or green color typically indicates a coolant leak.\n\nHow to Use Radiator Stop Leak\n\n1. Prepare Your Work Area\n\nBefore you learn how to use radiator stop leak, you need to find the source of the leak. There are many areas of your radiator that could be cracked, so finding the leak can take some time.\nPark your vehicle and wait for the engine to completely cool. Open the hood and wait up to a few hours before the engine is fully cooled. Radiators are pressurized systems, so be extremely cautious before opening your system or working in your engine compartment.\nUse safety gear to ensure a safe maintenance routine. Safety glasses and gloves are recommended for safe inspection and repair. To spot a leak, it\u2019s best to first clean your radiator and surrounding components. Use a hose to clear off your radiator. Avoid wiping any part of the radiator as this could cause further damage to the fragile cooling fins of the radiator.\nOnce your radiator is clean, check for any signs of cracks or leaks. A visual check of much the radiator may be difficult as it is located typically behind your air conditioning condenser and partly covered by a fan shroud. As best you can, inspect the radiator, the end tanks, reservoir, and any surrounding tubing. If you don\u2019t immediately see any leaks, turn on your engine and inspect your engine compartment.\n\n2. Finding the Source of a Radiator Leak\n\nA leaking radiator may be hissing, dripping or spraying coolant. You may have to inspect your radiator on all sides to find the source of the leak. Be cautious when looking under your vehicle, as your radiator leak may be spraying hot radiator fluid.\nFor a professional test, purchase a coolant system pressure tester. These convenient testers are secured on either the radiator or pressure cap spout and create a seal. Be sure to follow the instructions accompanying the tester ensuring the system without pressure before removing radiator cap. Once sealed, it pumps 10 pounds of pressure into the system. Check if your radiator is capable of sustaining 10 pounds of pressure. If the pressure drops, look for the source of the air leak.\nDon\u2019t use more than 10 or 15 pounds of pressure, otherwise you could damage your radiator and cause even more leaks. Your coolant system is typically only rated for 15 pounds, so any more pressure could have adverse effects.\n\n3. Seal Your Radiator Leak\n\nThere are a few common ways to fix your radiator. Depending on the situation you\u2019re in, you can use either emergency fixes or commercial products. Using a commercial product, like Bar\u2019s Leaks, offers a more reliable seal and avoids any additional damage to your vehicle, but there are a few household items you can use to fix your radiator temporarily in case of an emergency.\nFirst, an easy solution for most leaks is commercial leak sealant. While this sealant isn\u2019t as effective as the professional repair solution, it provides you with a reliable seal as you make your way to your local auto parts store or mechanic:\n\nOnce your engine is cool, pour your sealant directly into your cooling system\nTop off your radiator with coolant and water and seal your system\nRun your engine for approximately 10 minutes and then let it sit overnight\nTurn your engine on again to see if it has properly sealed\n\nAnother solution is to use radiator epoxy. Once you\u2019ve found a visible crack, clean the area thoroughly with brake cleaner exercising caution not to damage anything in the surrounding area. Once the area is completely dry, work your epoxy into a malleable putty and create a coat at least an eighth of an inch thick. Let it sit overnight and turn your engine on to test the seal.\n\nFind the Right Parts\u00a0Today",

A few minutes of simple inspection and maintenance can prevent a wide range of issues with your engine.\n\nCheck Your Coolant\u00a0Level and Color\n\nNow that you know some of the warning signs to check for, it\u2019s time to inspect your\u00a0radiator\u00a0and coolant reservoir. Make sure your vehicle is on level ground for accurate readings. You\u2019ll also want to wait for it to completely cool down, as your radiator and coolant can become extremely hot.\nOpen your hood and locate your radiator and\u00a0coolant reservoir. Some older vehicles don\u2019t include a reservoir, but most modern vehicles have a small tank for filling and checking the coolant level. The reservoir should be clear plastic, so you can easily see the level of coolant and the maximum fill line.\nBefore you top off your coolant, inspect your current coolant for any unusual coloring or contaminants. Coolant comes in a range of colors, so it\u2019s normal for it to be red, blue, yellow or green. However, if your coolant is colorless, rust-colored, has particles or is oily or sludgy, you\u2019ll want to have it inspected by your local mechanic. These are all signs of contamination that may indicate more severe issues like a\u00a0leak in your head gasket.\nOther warning signs to look out for include cracked radiator hoses and an extremely low coolant level. These need to be repaired, or your new coolant may leak out.\n\nHow to\u00a0Fill Your Coolant\n\nIf your coolant looks great and is just a little low, top it off with premium engine coolant. While IAT formula coolant is the most popular option for most vehicles, be sure to use the same coolant that\u2019s already in your vehicle.\nYour owner\u2019s manual will have more information about the correct type of coolant. Check to see if your brand of coolant needs to be mixed with water or comes pre-mixed. Adding pure coolant with no water can damage your radiator, while too much water mixture can prevent your coolant from working effectively at extreme temperatures.\nSimply top off your coolant to the top of the maximum fill line and close the cap. Make sure that no debris enters your radiator or coolant reservoir. Be sure both the reservoir and radiator caps are secured and start your vehicle.\n\nWhen to\u00a0Drain and Replace Your Coolant\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed any serious signs of damage to your radiator, or any unusual coloring to your coolant, it may be time to drain and replace it. It\u2019s a good idea to have a mechanic to perform these steps, as there could also be an issue with your head gasket or radiator.\nFirst, locate the plug on the bottom of your radiator. Place a\u00a0drain pan\u00a0underneath and completely drain your old coolant. Inspect your drain pan for any signs of particles or contaminants, as these are most likely caused by a cracked radiator or compromised hose. You\u2019ll need to perform additional repairs, or your new coolant will quickly become contaminated as well.\nRefill your coolant, making sure to bleed any air out of the system, replace the plug and top off your coolant reservoir. Start your engine and drive carefully to test whether there\u2019s any air caught in your system. Continue to inspect your coolant reservoir for any signs of a leak.\nNever refill your coolant when your engine is hot. Always wait for it to cool down. If you open a\u00a0radiator cap\u00a0when the engine is still hot, you could be burnt by escaping steam or hot coolant. Even after opening the cap, pouring cold or room-temperature coolant into your hot system could crack a hot engine block.\nCracked, bulging, and leaking hoses need to be replaced before you refill your coolant. When you inspect the radiator, you should take a look at all the hoses. You\u2019ll find them on the top and bottom of your radiator. Because of the extreme temperatures these hoses face, it\u2019s normal for them to begin to wear out and crack over time. After you\u2019ve drained your radiator, replace any damaged hose section for a sealed, secure system.\n\nShop for\u00a0Quality Coolant and Repair Parts\n\nNow that you know how to check antifreeze, it\u2019s time to pick up quality antifreeze. For the best brands and competitive pricing, stop by\u00a0your local AutoZone\u00a0today.

        "title": "What Is Antifreeze and What Does It Do?",
        "content": "Understanding\u00a0Antifreeze\n\nThe most common types of antifreeze are a combination of water and either ethylene glycol or polyproline glycol. Unless you are a chemist, the chemical makeup of antifreeze may not interest you much. Instead, you need to know the purpose of antifreeze. So, what does antifreeze do?\nIn simple terms, antifreeze circulates through your vehicle\u2019s engine to maintain the temperature of important components. Most importantly, antifreeze keeps the temperature of your vehicle\u2019s engine from dropping to a level that makes it difficult for the engine to do its job. That is, antifreeze prevents the engine from cooling off to a point where it may sustain significant damage. It also stops your car\u2019s engine from overheating. Because an overheated engine can crack, having a steady supply of high-quality antifreeze coursing through the engine is vital for the overall health of your car, truck or SUV.\nAntifreeze comes in a variety of colors, as manufacturers dye their products different shades. There is no distinguishable difference between neon green, pink, or orange coolant. Still, some recipes may use organic compounds that may appeal to you. Regardless of the color of antifreeze you choose, you should realize that coolant can be toxic to humans and pets. Therefore, you should not allow children, dogs or cats to drink spilled antifreeze.\n\nUsing\u00a0Antifreeze\n\nYour car has a\u00a0radiator\u00a0that is likely located in front of its engine. Antifreeze fills the radiator to facilitate cooling. Of course, because the radiator can reach temperatures that can easily burn human skin, the radiator also has an antifreeze or coolant reservoir. When antifreeze levels are low, you can pour coolant into the reservoir without worrying about hot liquid or steam burning you.\nAntifreeze travels through your vehicle\u2019s radiator and engine in a circular fashion, powered by the water pump. Coolant starts in the radiator before moving into the engine. There, it takes on heat that your car\u2019s internal combustion engine naturally creates. After leaving the engine, antifreeze moves past your vehicle\u2019s heating core. The heating core is responsible for keeping your car\u2019s passenger cabin warm when temperatures drop. After picking up heat from the engine and heating the core, antifreeze moves back into the radiator. There, heat disperses before the cycle begins again.\n\nDifferentiating Between\u00a0Water and Antifreeze\n\nAs mentioned, your vehicle\u2019s water pump circulates coolant throughout its\u00a0engine cooling system. While you know that the pump moves antifreeze, you may also wonder if water would work equally as well. The simple answer is no.\nWhen temperatures are moderate, water is probably sufficient to cool your vehicle\u2019s engine. Still, water may corrode sensitive parts of your vehicle. Adding anti-corrosive elements to water does the trick on ordinary days. Nonetheless, when temperatures climb or drop significantly, water does not have the ability to keep your vehicle\u2019s engine at the appropriate temperature. As such, while water may work in a pinch, antifreeze is necessary for the long-term survival of your vehicle\u2019s essential systems.\nWhy does antifreeze do a better job than ordinary water? The chemical formula of antifreeze both lowers its freezing temperature and raises its boiling temperature. As such, when ambient temperatures drop below freezing, antifreeze prevents cold weather from damaging your vehicle\u2019s engine. Further, when your vehicle warms up due to either normal functionality or high outside temperatures, antifreeze keeps internal engine temperatures under control.\n\nReplacing\u00a0Degraded antifreeze\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s engine uses motor oil for lubrication. Still, engine oil does not last forever. In fact, your vehicle\u2019s operator\u2019s manual probably recommends\u00a0changing motor oil\u00a0every few hundred miles, as oil degrades over time. The same is true for antifreeze.\nThe ethylene glycol or polyproline glycol in most antifreeze blends does not degrade over time. Still, antifreeze has anti-corrosion compounds that break down with ordinary usage. These compounds protect the metallic components in your vehicle\u2019s radiator, engine, and other systems from rusting. If you do not occasionally replace antifreeze, sensitive parts of your vehicle may corrode.\nKnowing\u00a0when to replace coolant\u00a0is not difficult. Unlike brake fluid and even engine oil, which may retain its appearance over time, coolant changes color as it breaks down. If your antifreeze takes on a rust-colored or brownish hue, it is likely time to flush it out of your radiator and replace it with a fresh supply.\n\nAdding\u00a0New Antifreeze\n\nIf you need to replace your vehicle\u2019s supply of antifreeze or top off the reservoir, you should first read through your owner\u2019s manual. As usual, following manufacturer recommendation is an effective way to achieve success when replacing or adding antifreeze. You should remember a few things about this fluid, though.\nFirst, you should note that antifreeze usually comes undiluted. With most vehicles, undiluted antifreeze is not compatible. Instead, you must mix the antifreeze with distilled water before adding it to the radiator. A 50-50 mixture of antifreeze and distilled water is typically correct. Still, it is possible to buy premixed antifreeze. If you go this route, you do not want to dilute antifreeze before adding it.\nWhen mixing antifreeze and distilled water, you also must think about where you drive your vehicle. If you keep your car in a place that has temperatures that consistently fall below 34 degrees, you likely want to have a higher percentage of antifreeze than distilled water in your radiator. Generally, a 60-40 or even 70-30 ratio is appropriate.\n\nStaying Ahead of\u00a0Vehicle Maintenance",

        "title": "How to Replace a Radiator",
        "content": "How To Replace a Radiator\n\n1. Safety First\n\nYour radiator has electrical connections. Disconnect the battery before proceeding. You\u2019ll need to raise the vehicle so you can access your radiator. You can use a car jack and stands to keep the vehicle up, but remember to put a chock behind the wheels and engage the parking brake. Wait until the engine is cold before proceeding.\nThis job can be dangerous, so be extra careful. You will encounter sharp edges and other circumstances that could cause injury. Protect yourself by wearing quality safety gloves and goggles. Be watchful of any moving items while working.\nAnd, to repeat, make sure the car, engine, and coolant are NOT hot!\n\n2. Inspect or Replace\n\nBefore jumping in and replacing a whole radiator, take a minute to inspect your entire coolant system. Examine the radiator (or overflow) cap. Check the belts and hoses for damaged, cracked rubber or any leaks. Find the fan clutch between the radiator and the water pump motor (on some vehicles) and make sure there is no play in the bearings. \nDon\u2019t forget about your engine thermostat. If your cooling problem has caused the engine to overheat, your thermostat may have been damaged. You may want to replace this small part when replacing the radiator.\n\n3. Drain the Radiator\n\nThere are two ways to drain radiators. Remove the radiator cap for either way. Once the cap is removed, you can either open the petcock valve or remove the bottom radiator hose to drain the coolant.  Drain the coolant into a plastic reservoir.\n\n4. Disconnect the Radiator\n\nWith the coolant drained, you can start removing hoses, clamps and the radiator bolts keeping the radiator in place. You\u2019ll have to disconnect the following parts on most vehicles:\n\u2022\tRadiator reservoir hose\n\u2022\tUpper radiator hose\n\u2022\tLower radiator hose\n\u2022\tCooling fan connector\n\u2022\tCooling fan mounting bolts\n\u2022\tCooling fan\n\u2022\tCooling fan shroud\n\u2022\tTransmission cooler lines (many vehicles require special tools to disconnect)\n\u2022\tEngine oil cooler lines (these appear in many high-heat vehicles like 4\u00d74 and Deisel trucks)\n\u2022\tA/C Condenser mounting bolts\n\u2022\tRadiator mounting bolts\nRemember to keep all the hoses, connectors, bolts, and components organized. You\u2019ll have to reinstall the parts in reverse order.\n\n5. Remove the Old Radiator\n\nWith all the hoses, bolts, and lines removed, you should be able to remove the radiator from the vehicle. Many radiators can be removed by lifting up and out of the vehicle, but some need to be removed from underneath the vehicle.\n\n6. Mount the New Radiator\n\nSet the new radiator in place, and then reattach all the previously removed parts. Start with the radiator mounting bolts and finish with the radiator reservoir hose.\n\n7. Add Coolant\n\nCheck that the petcock is closed and that all other valves and caps on the new radiator are shut. With all the hoses and bolts attached, fill the new radiator with coolant. Check oil and transmission fluid levels in case any was lost during the installation.\nThis is an excellent time to flush your coolant system and replace the old coolant with new coolant. Unless the coolant was recently replaced, we highly recommend performing a flush and fill. The old, drained coolant can become contaminated with debris or transmission fluid during the process of replacing the radiator, and its a safe bet to just flush and install new coolant.\nUse distilled water for mixing and adding to the cooling system. The water to coolant ratio must be correct. Most applications use a 50/50 mixture although some may require a stronger coolant ratio. Refer to a Repair Manual for specific applications for your vehicle and typical annual weather. \n\n8. Bleed the air from the Cooling System\n\nTrapped air in the cooling system can cause overheating and reduce the heater\u2019s output performance. The process of bleeding air varies by vehicle, so refer to a repair manual for special procedures to remove trapped air.\nAs part of the process, you may need to start the car and let it idle. During this step, watch the car closely to make sure it does not overheat. Check the heat gauge and dashboard lights while the car idles for at least 10 to 20 minutes. Also look out for leaks. \nRe-check the coolant level in the reservoir (overflow) tank after the job is completed and the system has completely cooled off. Also re-check the automatic transmission fluid and engine oil levels.\nRe-check for leaks, especially overnight.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "content": "How Should I Get Rid of Antifreeze?\nMake sure the antifreeze is in a safe, closable container to prevent spills. Contact local recycling centers or service stations for more information on local disposal. Do NOT pour antifreeze down the drain. Do NOT pour antifreeze outside. The content of your antifreeze, whether it is new or used or mixed with another fluid, is important. Take note of the makeup of your antifreeze when inquiring about local disposal methods.\nHow Do I Clean Up Antifreeze?\nBe conscientious of spills in your garage or work area. Antifreeze should  be cleaned immediately if spilled. Carefully and safely absorb the material with kitty litter or sand, and cover with paper towels. Next, wipe up after letting it absorb or rest. Throw away the collected material and wash the area with soap and water before drying thoroughly.\nIs Antifreeze Dangerous for Pets?\nYes, very much so. Antifreeze is toxic for pretty much all living things, but pets are particularly attracted to the smell and taste of antifreeze.

        "title": "Common Cooling Problems",
        "content": "Common Cooling Problems\n\n1. Coolant leaks and fluid\n\nThe most common coolant issue is low fluid caused by a leak. A leak can occur anywhere in the cooling system from a cracked or worn hose and radiator to a leaking water pump seal or heater core. To check for leaks or cracks that aren\u2019t immediately visible, use a pressure tester. The pressure tester forces coolant through the system, making any leaks more obvious.\n\n2. Flush and fill\n\nWhen was the last time you flushed and filled your radiator? Electrochemical degradation from old coolant and contaminants can weaken the cooling system, leading to corrosion of the radiator and puts hoses, the water pump, thermostat and radiator cap at risk. A coolant flush and fill is recommended every five years or every 100,000 miles. If you\u2019re worried about an issue within this interval, you can use a coolant tester to measure temperature protection.\n\n3. Thermostat failure\n\nThermostats control the flow of coolant into the radiator by changing between \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 positions. When they fail, they stick in one of these two positions. If the thermostat fails in the open position, it will allow a continuous flow of coolant into the radiator, causing the engine to run inefficiently and other parts to incur extra wear. In this situation, your vehicle will not be able to reach operating temperature. A few ways to notice this issue are if the temperature gauge hovers around the C marker, if the check engine light comes on, or if the heater is blowing cool or just a little warm, but not hot. If the thermostat fails in the closed position, coolant flow is blocked completely and your engine will overheat. In this case, a dashboard light should surface, you\u2019ll notice the temperature gauge closer to H, staying on H, or jumping to H very quickly while driving, and the thermostat needs to be replaced immediately.",

        "content": "Choosing the Right Coolant\n\nPrioritize Safety\n\nYour first priority when learning how to flush a coolant system, or completing any vehicle maintenance project, is your personal safety. Start by parking your car on a surface that is both dry and flat. You can then use\u202fwheel chocks\u202fso that your vehicle will not move while you\u2019re working.\nWait for at least an hour after you turn off your engine before attempting to flush your radiator. Place your hand near the car radiator to get an idea of the car\u2019s heat level. If you feel no heat, place your hand near the radiator cap. Again, if you feel no heat you can proceed with the job. Finally, safety gloves and goggles should be worn while doing this job.\n\nTools and Equipment\n\nFlushing your car\u2019s coolant system is more than just emptying the radiator and refilling, as the car\u2019s engine block, heater core, and other items all contain antifreeze. DIY flush kits are available at AutoZone that hook into your heater hoses and flush garden hose water through the entire system, and through your heater core. \nIt is highly recommended that when doing a flush, you are flushing the entire system out with water in this fashion. Once you\u2019ve determined whether you are going to do a complete flush or just a radiator drain/full, proceed by opening your hood and secure it so that you can inspect your radiator along with all the attached hoses. Keep an eye out for any leaks, cracks, or stressed-looking rubber. A worn and damaged hose may need to be replaced. At this time, install your flush kit into the heater hose if you plan on flushing the system.\n\nHow to Flush Your Radiator / Cooling System\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and install\u202fwheel chocks. Make sure the vehicle has not been running for at least an hour and that the engine and radiator are cool. Be sure to wear\u202fsafety goggles\u202fand\u202fprotective gloves. Keep coolant away from pets or small children. Clean up any spills immediately. Do not pour coolant down a drain or toilet.\n\n2. Setting Up The Job\n\nOpen and secure the hood. Inspect the\u202fradiator and hoses for any cracks or signs of leaks. Once you\u2019ve determined whether you are going to do a complete flush or just a radiator drain/full, proceed by opening your hood and secure it so that you can inspect your radiator along with all the attached hoses.\nKeep an eye out for any leaks, cracks, or stressed-looking rubber. A worn and damaged hose may need to be replaced. At this time, install your flush kit into the heater hose if you plan on flushing the system. If you notice a worn or damaged hose, it may need to be replaced.\n\n3. Press Down and Remove the Radiator Cap\n\nCarefully press down on the radiator cap and remove it. Make sure the vehicle has not been running for at least an hour and that the engine and radiator are cool. Opening the cap on a hot radiator is extremely dangerous.\n\n4. Locate the Drain Plug and Loosen\n\nLocate the drain plug. This is found on the bottom of the radiator. Place a pan under the drain plug to catch old coolant. Loosen the drain plug and allow coolant to flow. Tighten the drain\u202fplug when coolant has stopped flowing.\n\n5. Fill the Cooling System with Distilled Water\n\nCheck instructions on flush bottle for specific steps. Steps vary according to flush product. Fill the system with both water and flush product. Using a flush product is good to break up any sediment or corrosion and get it out of the system.\n\n6. Install the Radiator Cap and Run the Engine\n\nInstall the radiator cap and run the engine for 10 minutes with the heater on maximum. Only run the engine outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Turn off engine and allow radiator to cool. Repeat drain procedure.\n\n7. Loosen Lower Radiator Hose\n\nOnce you\u2019ve ran flush through and drained the radiator again, it\u2019s a good idea to get any sediment out of the bottom of the radiator that the drain cannot remove. Once the hose is loose and can be removed. Fill the radiator up with garden hose or bottled water, then pull the hose and drain any sediment / dirty water out. At this point, very little of the water will contain antifreeze, but a good deal of sediment that has settled in the bottom of the radiator will come out. Next, hook up your hose to your flush valve you installed and follow the flushing instructions.\n\n8. Drain Out Final Dirty Water\n\nOnce the system has been completely flushed, you will need to drain the system of the remaining dirty flush water in both the radiator, and as much out of the block as you can. Remember, all of this water contains antifreeze, so make sure you follow local ordinances on capturing antifreeze.\n\n9. Fill with New Antifreeze\n\nFill the system with new antifreeze. If using concentrated antifreeze, be sure to use distilled water. Located any bleeder screws in the system that need to be opened to remove excess air. It is vitally important that these are located, or an air bubble can cause the car to overheat.\n\nThe Cleanup\n\nClean the area around your pan and make sure no spilled fluids are on the ground. Next, you need to dispose of the old coolant and other fluids in your pan. There are many laws governing the disposal of these fluids and they vary in different jurisdictions, so make sure you are following the regulations where you live. Whatever you do, never pour these fluids down your toilet or into a drain. Finally, give yourself a hand. You now know how to flush your radiator and cooling system!\n\nGet the Help You Need\n\nBoth draining and replacing the coolant in your engine are repair jobs that will present a moderate level of difficulty. If you have any questions about the coolant flush cost or any step in the flush process, don\u2019t hesitate to call or visit your nearest AutoZone store.

        "content": "Understanding the Basics of Car Batteries\n\nA car battery is a rechargeable storage device that supplies electrical energy your car\u2019s systems. Its main purpose is to start the engine, and once the engine is running, power for the car\u2019s electrical systems is typically supplied by the alternator. But the battery can die if the alternator isn\u2019t charging properly or if there\u2019s an electrical draw in your car, whether a defect or something like a light accidentally left on.\nSome common signs of a failing battery include the engine cranking slowly when trying to start, a dashboard battery warning light, and issues with electrical components such as the lights or power windows that move slowly. If your car shows these symptoms, it\u2019s a good indication that the battery is either weak or dead.\n\nSafety First: Preparing for a Solo Jump Start\n\nSafety must be the top priority when dealing with car batteries, especially when working alone.\u00a0\nAlways have gloves and safety goggles on hand when dealing with a car battery. In case of battery acid leaks, a battery acid neutralizer spray or a mixture of baking soda and water should be handy. Additionally, having a fire extinguisher nearby can be a smart safety precaution.\nLook out for bulging, cracked, or leaking car batteries. These are high-risk situations and jumping the car should not be attempted. Instead, it\u2019s best to replace the battery, or call for a tow truck to address the issue.\n\nThe Step-by-Step Guide to Jump-Starting Your Car Alone\n\nKnowing how to jump start a car by yourself is a skill that can be very rewarding and reassuring if you drive alone frequently. These steps are easy to follow, start to finish, no matter which method you choose.\u00a0\n\nStep 1: Locate and Access the Car Battery\n\nFind the car battery, which is usually located under the hood. In some cars, the battery is located in the trunk or other areas that are less accessible, like under the rear seat. If you don\u2019t immediately find your battery, check your car\u2019s manual for the exact battery location. There may also be jump-starting points under the hood.\n\nStep 2: Connect Jumper Cables Safely\n\nTurn off the ignition and all electrical systems in both vehicles.\n\nConnect the red positive clamp on one side of the jumper cables to the positive terminal on the dead battery.\n\nAttach the other red positive clamp to the positive terminal on the good battery or the positive jump start terminal.\n\nConnect the black negative clamp to the negative terminal on the good battery.\n\nAttach the final black negative clamp to a clean, metal part of your car\u2019s engine block or chassis. This is a precaution to help avoid a spark near the potentially explosive gas fumes surrounding a battery.\n\nStep 3: Start the Dead Vehicle\n\nDouble check the cable connections on both vehicles to ensure they are stable and secure.\n\nStart the vehicle with the good battery and allow it to run for a few minutes.\n\nStart the vehicle with the dead battery and leave both vehicles running for an additional five to ten minutes to allow the dead battery to charge, albeit minimally.\n\nRev the engine slightly on the car with the good battery to give the dead battery a little extra boost.\n\nDisconnect the cables in the reverse order from how they were attached.\n\nAlternative Methods for Jump-Starting Without Another Car\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to another vehicle, there are alternative methods for jump-starting a car battery. Remember that you should always read the product\u2019s instructions before using it.\n\nPortable Jump Starters\n\nPortable jump starters are compact devices equipped with a large battery and jumper cables. They are an excellent alternative to traditional jump-starting. Here\u2019s how to use them:\n\nFirst, ensure the portable jump starter is sufficiently charged via the level indicator.\n\nConnect the red clamp to the positive terminal of the battery and the black clamp to a clean, unpainted metal surface in the engine compartment.\n\nStart your engine as usual.\n\nBattery Chargers\n\nBattery chargers can also be used to revive a dead car battery. Follow these general steps:\n\nPlace the battery charger where it can easily reach the battery.\n\nConnect the red positive cable to the positive terminal of the battery.\n\nAttach the black negative cable to a metal part of the car\u2019s chassis, not the battery.\n\nTurn on the battery charger and select the appropriate charging setting.\n\nOnce charged, disconnect the charger from the car battery in the reverse order.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How Long Do EV Batteries Really Last?",
        "content": "Introduction to EV Batteries\n\nElectric vehicle batteries are responsible for storing and delivering the electric energy that propels EVs. Unlike the lead-acid batteries found in traditional vehicles, EV batteries are typically Lithium-ion (Li-ion) or variations of this technology due to their high energy density and relatively light weight.\nUnderstanding the life expectancy of these high-tech marvels is imperative, as they constitute a significant portion of the vehicle\u2019s overall cost and are not as simple to replace as the 12-volt battery you\u2019re used to. Modern EV batteries use an array of cells connected in series and parallel to achieve the required voltage and capacity. These cells are packed within modules and are then combined to create a battery pack. Managing the delicate balance within these cells is critical to extending the battery\u2019s life.\n\nFactors Influencing Battery Lifespan\n\nEV batteries, despite their advanced abilities, are not immune to the effects of time. Several factors play into how long an EV battery will last before it needs replacing.\n\nTemperature \u2013 Temperature perhaps has the most significant impact. Extremes of hot and cold can both degrade the battery. This is why many electric vehicles come equipped with sophisticated thermal management systems to keep the battery at just the right temperature.\u00a0\nCharging cycles \u2013 The number of charging cycles a battery undergoes takes its toll. Each time a battery goes from a full charge to a full discharge counts as one cycle. However, it\u2019s the high and low states of charge that are particularly stressful for the batteries and can accelerate their wear.\u00a0\nDiagnostic charges \u2013 EVs that sit idle for extended periods can face the issue of deep discharge, a phenomenon that occurs when the battery loses charge over time. This is why many battery management systems will engage in periodic diagnostic charges to ensure a level of charge even while the vehicle is not in use.\n\nGenerally, though, experts believe that an EV battery should last well beyond its minimum warranty timeframe of eight years with 15 years being a reasonable expectation.\n\nSigns of Battery Deterioration\n\nThe good news is that EV batteries typically degrade gradually, showing signs of wear over time. Being able to spot these early can save you from more significant issues down the road.\nOne of the initial telltale signs is a decreased range per charge.

        "title": "Does Cold Weather Affect EV Batteries?\u00a0",
        "content": "Introduction to EV Battery Technology\n\nTo understand how cold weather impacts EV batteries, you need to first understand the basics of these power units. EV batteries are, in essence, large-capacity energy storage systems designed to drive electric motors. Lithium-ion batteries, the most common type used in EVs today, consist of cells that store electricity through chemical reactions.\nLike any battery, electrons flow from the positively charged cathode to the negatively charged anode in an EV battery. Then, when the battery is being charged, the electron flow is reversed. Unlike other smaller batteries, the EV battery pack is a series of battery modules containing dozens or hundreds of smaller battery cells, and each of them function in the same way.\n\nThe Influence of Temperature on Battery Performance\n\nTemperature plays a vital role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries, to be certain. These batteries operate best within a set temperature range, and the ideal temperature for performance is between 68 and 110 F. Chemical reactions within the batteries are temperature-dependent, and when temperatures drop, these reactions slow down, resulting in diminished energy storage and discharge capacity.\nWhat that means is that the battery\u2019s kinetic energy is slower than the ideal range, and it won\u2019t perform as well when it\u2019s cold.\n\nCold Weather Challenges for EV Batteries\n\nFrigid temperatures pose specific challenges for EV owners. The most noticeable is the reduced range. The battery\u2019s ability to hold and discharge energy efficiently drops, meaning that you might not get as many miles out of a single charge as you would during warmer months.\nYou might notice:\n\nThe car\u2019s acceleration is slower than you\u2019re used to in warm weather.\nThe battery range is significantly less \u2013 as much as 40 percent lower during winter driving than in summer.\nThe battery depletes when it\u2019s idle as it uses energy to keep itself warm.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only impact that temperature has on EV batteries. With cold temperatures, the interior climate control activates and electrically-operated heat pump or an electric heater \u2013 or both. The energy used to keep the cabin warm also takes away from the operating range. The warmer you make the interior, the shorter your range tends to be.\nAdditionally, charging times can increase, and regenerative braking systems\u2014which help recharge the battery\u2014may become less effective. These drawbacks can lead to anxiety over being stranded without a charge or the inconvenience of longer charging periods.\n\nTips for Cold Weather Battery Maintenance\n\nDespite the challenges, there are several strategies EV owners can take to counteract the effects of cold weather on their vehicles:\n\nPreconditioning the car while still connected to the charger can warm up the battery before use, helping to preserve its range.\nKeeping EVs garaged and insulated from the harsh weather conditions outside helps maintain a more consistent temperature.\nIt\u2019s also beneficial to limit the use of high-drain accessories while driving and to adhere to a sensible charge range of 20 to 80 percent to avoid undue stress on the battery.\n\nAnother great way to make your car\u2019s battery range last is to modify your driving habits for the winter. Accelerate in a controlled and conservative manner to reduce the high-drain scenarios. And when possible, adjust your regenerative braking to recoup as much energy as possible during stops. That way, you\u2019ll retain the most range possible for your car and, as a side benefit, your brake pads wear less.\n\nInnovations and Future Developments\n\nFortunately, the future looks promising for EV operation in colder climates. Battery heating systems are becoming more sophisticated, working to keep the battery in its optimal temperature range. Also, ongoing research is dedicated to developing batteries with better cold-weather performance, focusing on new types of electrolytes and anode and cathode materials that are less affected by low temperatures. Developments in solid state batteries, for example, could make cold weather changes less of a concern.\nManufacturers and researchers continue to focus on making EVs as reliable in the winter as they are during the summer, ensuring that EV owners can drive with confidence, no matter the weather. These advancements stand to expand the appeal and viability of electric cars in regions with harsh winter climates.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Understanding NOCO Portable Jump Starters\nNOCO\u2019s line of portable jump starters are compact, ultra-portable, lightweight devices designed to jump-start 12-volt batteries using lithium-ion technology. They\u2019re made for both professional and personal use with varying capacities.\nThe device works by delivering a powerful surge of electricity to a dead battery, allowing it to start the engine. For instance, the NOCO Boost Plus GB40 can deliver 1,000 amps, which is sufficient to jump-start a dead battery in seconds, and it can provide up to 20 jump starts on a single charge.\nTo use a NOCO portable jump starter, you connect the clamps from the jump starter to the appropriate terminals on your car battery, ensuring that positive connects with positive and negative with negative. Once connected, the jump starter delivers the necessary energy to start your car\u2019s engine, and all you need to do is turn the key.\nExploring Traditional Jumper Cables\nTraditional jumper cables, also known as booster cables, are a pair of heavy-gauge insulated wires with large alligator clips at each end to connect the dead battery of a vehicle with an external power source. Typically, these cables are used to connect a charged battery from another vehicle to jump-start the car with the dead battery. Cable sets tend to range from around 10 feet to 25 feet in length.\nThe dead battery is connected first, then the donor vehicle\u2019s battery is connected next, and the energy from the donor provides the energy the engine needs to turn over.\nAdvantages of NOCO Portable Jump Starters\nA jump starter from NOCO is a great option for drivers to have a backup power source with them all the time. they\u2019re more compact than booster cables, have technology to prevent sparks and reversing polarity, and they avoid the need to ask someone for help.

        "title": "Signs of a Hybrid Battery Dying",
        "content": "What the Hybrid Battery Does\n\nThe hybrid battery is a series of battery modules made up of individual cells, similar to an AA battery. Combined, they deliver energy to the electrified part of the car to assist or substitute for the gas powertrain. The battery is recharged by an inverter that draws excess energy from the internal combustion engine\u2019s system, and most hybrids also harvest energy through regenerative braking. Certain hybrid models can also be plugged in to recharge the battery.\u00a0\nWhy are hybrids popular? The main two reasons are that they reduce fuel consumption, and they reduce vehicle emissions for greener transportation.\u00a0\n\nSigns a hybrid battery is failing\n\nWhen the battery is no functioning at or near its full capacity, there\u2019s a noticeable decline in performance. These are five signs that can indicate your hybrid\u2019s battery needs attention soon (or right now).\u00a0\n\n1. Hybrid system warning light\n\nThe hybrid system warning light, also known as the \u201cCheck Hybrid System\u201d warning light, is a warning indicator found in hybrid vehicles. In some vehicles, it\u2019s a triangle with an exclamation mark within it, and on other vehicles, it\u2019s accompanied by a message on the cluster display. This light typically appears as a yellow or amber color and is usually located on the dashboard.\nIf the hybrid system warning light appears on the dashboard, it means there is an issue with the hybrid battery or the hybrid system itself. It could be caused by a malfunction in the battery, the electric motor, the power inverter, or the hybrid control module, but the battery is the most common culprit.\n\n2. Charging issues\n\nIf the battery pack in a hybrid has bad or imbalanced cells, or serious degradation has occurred in it due to age or usage, it will often experience issues with charging. Typically, it will accept a charge at a slower rate than normal or not completely charging while you drive. The in-vehicle display might show rapid discharge while it\u2019s in electric mode or it may never show it\u2019s charged to 100%.\n\n3. Reduced range\n\nA weak, sulfated, or otherwise compromised hybrid battery pack may still initiate hybrid mode or EV mode. However, the reduced capacity means that the electrical charge isn\u2019t sufficient for your usual operating range. On your instrument cluster, the estimated distance to empty might show up normally but your car may not achieve it since there\u2019s less stored energy in the battery.\n\n4. Poor fuel economy\n\nSince the gas engine needs to operate more to compensate for the lower battery capacity, it\u2019s going to burn more fuel. It can be substantial. For example, if your hybrid is rated for 50 miles per gallon combined city and highway, it may only achieve 40 MPG or less. That decrease in fuel economy means higher costs to operate your car, naturally, so the longer you wait to fix it, the worse it is.\n\n5. Strange noises\n\nWith a bad hybrid battery, symptoms can also include unusual sounds inside your car. You might hear an electrical hum that either comes and goes or is there constantly while you drive, or there could be clicks and pops you hear. One noise could be a fan that pushes air over the battery that\u2019s louder than normal since a bad battery often generates more heat than normal.\n\n6. What to do about a bad hybrid battery\n\nIn some instances, a bad hybrid battery can be serviced with a process known as battery pack balancing. In other cases, battery reconditioning can add months or even years of extra life to a failing high-voltage battery.\n\nIf your battery can\u2019t be recovered, a replacement hybrid battery is the best route to take. Although it\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s more cost-effective than replacing your car, and the old battery can be recycled to create new batteries.",

        "title": "Hybrid Battery Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Costs associated with hybrid battery replacement\u00a0\n\nDifferent makes and models use different hybrid batteries, and it varies depending if the vehicle is a mild hybrid, full hybrid, or plug-in hybrid. The battery pack itself is the majority of the cost with variations ranging from around $1,000 to $6,000, although most batteries for common models tend to be under $3,000.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlong with the battery itself, you\u2019ll need to pay a certified mechanic to install the high-voltage battery. The job often takes a few hours, and sometimes more than a full day. Labor prices range from around $500 to $1,500 but could be higher based on where you reside and the repair shop you choose.\u00a0\nOther than the battery and labor, there might be a few incidentals to consider such as inverter coolant, clips or connectors that may break, and the cost of diagnosis or programming.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFactors that can impact the cost of hybrid battery replacement\u00a0\n\nThe most prevalent factor for the cost to replace hybrid batteries has to do with the make and model you drive. For example, a 2012 Toyota Prius has a NiMH battery pack that can hold 1.3 kWh (kilowatt-hours) of energy. The 2018 Honda Accord hybrid has a 17kWh battery pack, whereas a 2016 Chevrolet Silverado mild hybrid has a 0.45kWh Li-ion battery pack. With such a wide range of battery pack sizes, the larger the battery, the more you\u2019ll need to pay.\u00a0\nAlso, the battery chemistry makes a difference in price. Older technology such as NiMH batteries are less expensive to produce, so they\u2019re more affordable. Li-ion batteries use highly sought-after materials and contain more energy than an NiMH battery of the same size, and they\u2019re consequently more costly.\u00a0\nAlso, the battery pack for a luxury model seems to consistently be more expensive than a similarly-sized hybrid battery for a mainstream brand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen should a hybrid battery be replaced?\u00a0\n\nIn select models from brands like Kia, there\u2019s a pre-determined replacement interval for the hybrid battery of 10 years or 150,000 miles, or sooner if necessary. But for most models, the battery simply needs to be changed when it doesn\u2019t perform like it should.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the range has deteriorated significantly on EV mode, that\u2019s often an indicator that the battery isn\u2019t holding its full capacity anymore. Also, if the car\u2019s gas engine isn\u2019t shutting off like it used to when it\u2019s in electric mode, the battery could be on its way out. You\u2019ll notice a substantial difference in fuel economy if the hybrid system isn\u2019t working too.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWays to save on hybrid battery replacement costs\u00a0\n\nBecause it\u2019s not the cheapest repair you could imagine, you\u2019ll want to save on battery replacement costs if at all possible. The first way to do that is to properly maintain your hybrid system. Your maintenance guide may prescribe filter cleaning or replacement for the battery cooling fan, or the inverter coolant may need to be replaced. Don\u2019t skimp on these service items \u2013 it could be at the detriment of your battery years earlier than necessary.\u00a0\nAlso, try to keep your battery topped up when it\u2019s parked. Storing a hybrid with a depleted battery can cause sulfation that reduces range permanently. And whenever you can, park in an area where your car isn\u2019t exposed to extreme heat or cold.\u00a0\nIf you begin to notice the battery range is less than it used to be, hybrid battery reconditioning or balancing could help restore its performance and stretch out its lifespan for a few months or years.",

        "title": "How Long Do Hybrid Batteries Last?\u00a0",
        "content": "Average hybrid battery lifespan\u00a0\n\nCar manufacturers are required to warranty a hybrid battery for at least eight years or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first, according to federal law. Some warranties are even 10 years. However, that isn\u2019t necessarily the battery\u2019s lifespan. It\u2019s possible for a battery to fail before that time or mileage, and it\u2019s also common for a hybrid battery to last much longer than its warrantied period.\u00a0\u00a0\nProperly cared for, some hybrid owners have achieved 150,000 miles and, occasionally, more than 200,000 miles before replacing the battery. An average lifespan tends to be around 10 years or between 100,000 and 150,000 miles. Newer cars with the latest technology might stretch that average further.\u00a0\n\nFactors that affect the lifespan of a hybrid battery\u00a0\n\nSeldom will two drivers have the same results from their hybrid vehicle\u2019s battery life. How soon a battery fails is affected by a handful of factors like:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUsage \u2013 a higher number of charge-discharge cycles will cause the battery to deteriorate.\u00a0\nDriving conditions \u2013 the battery can be strained by extreme hot or cold, high altitude conditions, and even heavy loads like hard acceleration or towing.\u00a0\nMaintenance \u2013 keeping the battery charged for storage and periodic battery balancing can help prolong its life.\u00a0\nMaterials and chemistry \u2013 a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery pack will tend to last longer than a nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery.\u00a0\nAge \u2013 internal degradation happens naturally in a battery of any design, reducing its lifespan.\u00a0\nBrand \u2013 certain carmakers have a better track record of hybrid battery life than others.\u00a0\n\nSigns of a bad hybrid battery\u00a0\n\nHow do you know when your hybrid battery is failing? It can manifest differently depending on the car and the driver.\u00a0\n\n1. Warning Light\n\nA hybrid battery warning can illuminate on your instrument cluster. A red or yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in it could show up or a written message like \u201cHybrid System Warning\u201d. While it\u2019s a general warning for the hybrid system, it\u2019s often related to the battery.\u00a0\n\n2. Reduced Performance\n\nYou could notice reduced power or performance while you drive. When it\u2019s in electric mode or sport modes that use both the gas and electric motors combined, you might not feel the same acceleration that you\u2019re used to.\u00a0\n\n3. Lower Fuel Efficiency\n\nYour fuel efficiency can suffer. That\u2019s because the battery isn\u2019t contributing as much or as often as it normally does, and your gas engine is running more.\u00a0\n\n4. Reduced Driving Range\n\nReduced driving range is often detected. On your dash, the distance to empty could be significantly less than you\u2019re used to seeing.\u00a0\n\n5. Strange Noises\n\nAs well, strange noises can occur if the hybrid battery is failing. It can range from clicks to whining to buzzes, and it might come from any area of your vehicle\u2019s electric propulsion system.\u00a0\n\nA hybrid battery warning can illuminate on your instrument cluster.

That includes keeping the hybrid cooling system filter clean and changing the inverter coolant, if so equipped.\u00a0\nOperating conditions play a large role in how long your hybrid\u2019s battery will last also. Extreme temperatures should be avoided when possible, so park in the shade when the temperatures are hot and attempt to keep your vehicle in a moderated climate if it\u2019s extremely cold outside. Use your car normally, avoiding hard acceleration and hard braking when you can.\u00a0\u00a0\nPrevent the battery from becoming deeply discharged. The optimal charging criteria are to limit your discharge to 50% of capacity rather than running the battery down completely. Avoid storing your car when the battery is either overcharged or undercharged \u2013 that\u2019s when accelerated deterioration occurs.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Hybrid Car Battery",
        "content": "Signs the hybrid battery is failing\u00a0\n\nWhy do hybrid batteries fail? In most cases, it\u2019s the natural deterioration of materials inside the battery cells, much like a car battery loses its capacity. An imbalance between cells can also cause poor performance and issues with charging, as can a jarring impact.\u00a0\nThere are several signs that a hybrid battery may be failing such as:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nReduced fuel efficiency \u2013 If the hybrid battery is not working properly, the car may switch to gasoline power more often, resulting in lower fuel efficiency.\u00a0\nWarning lights on the dashboard \u2013 Many hybrid cars have a warning light that will come on if there is a problem with the battery or hybrid system.\u00a0\nReduced power or acceleration \u2013 A failing hybrid battery may not be able to provide the same level of power or acceleration as a fully charged battery.\u00a0\nReduced electric-only driving range \u2013 If the battery is failing, the car may not be able to drive as far on electric power alone or it might not switch into EV mode at all\u00a0\nBattery isn\u2019t holding a charge \u2013 If the hybrid battery is not holding a charge properly, the car may not be able to start or may have a shorter electric-only driving range.\u00a0\n\nSteps to change a hybrid battery pack\u00a0\n\nFirst, a warning:\u00a0\u00a0\nThere is a risk of serious electric shock from improperly working on or handling a hybrid battery, and damage can result to the battery itself. You should obtain proper training and certification to service hybrid cars before attempting a DIY repair involving the high-voltage battery.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re trained and equipped to replace the battery on your hybrid, tools and supplies you\u2019ll need include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInsulated rubber gloves rated Class 0 1000-volt\u00a0\nEye protection\u00a0\nAn insulated socket and ratchet set\u00a0\nNon-conductive wrenches and screwdrivers\u00a0\nTrim tools\u00a0\nSpill response kit for electrolyte\u00a0\n\nWith your tools and safety equipment collected, park your vehicle on a flat surface, set the parking brake, and begin the job.\u00a0\n\n1. Disconnect the 12-volt battery\n\nWith the car parked and the ignition off, disconnect the 12-volt battery\u2019s negative cable. If it remains energized, there can be an inadvertent activation in the electrical system that causes problems later. Depending on the battery location, you might choose to remove it altogether. It\u2019s also a good time to check its condition and replace it if necessary.\n\n2. Remove the hybrid battery disconnect\n\nHybrid vehicles are designed with a master disconnect that cuts power to the car from the battery pack. Check your owner\u2019s manual for its location in your car, then remove it. Keep the disconnect in a safe place because you\u2019ll need to reuse it with the new hybrid battery.\n\n3. Remove trim panels\n\nMost hybrid battery packs are in the trunk or hatch area, although they could also be under the rear seat. Once you\u2019ve determined where it is, remove the trim panels that hinder its access. Use trim tools to prevent broken clips and panels, and always double-check for screws and bolts before forcing a panel to come off. Set them aside on carpeting or cardboard to prevent damage.\n\n4. Access electrical connections\n\nFrom here on, wear your insulated gloves to avoid the potential for a shock.\nLocate where the electrical connections are at the battery pack, then remove them by carefully disconnecting the clips or screws. Tuck them safely out of the way so they don\u2019t come into contact with the old or new battery accidentally while you work. These connections are usually under a protective shield that will need to be removed first.\n\n5. Disconnect vent or coolant tubes\n\nBefore taking the old battery out, check around the complete battery pack and disconnect any tubes, ducts, or coolant lines that might be attached. These items could be damaged if you try removing the battery without disconnecting them first, adding cost and time to the job.\n\n6. Assemble with the new battery\n\nPlace the new battery into your vehicle, then assemble everything you\u2019ve removed in the reverse order. It\u2019s a good idea to hand-start each bolt and nut before tightening them, otherwise, it could be difficult to get the last bolts lined up. Once it\u2019s all assembled, install the battery disconnect and connect the 12-volt battery.",

        "title": "How to Jumpstart a Hybrid Battery",
        "content": "Why would a hybrid need a jump start?\u00a0\n\nIf the battery in your hybrid car is drained and doesn\u2019t contain enough energy to crank the engine over, it\u2019s going to need a boost. It could be something simple that has drawn it down such as leaving the ignition in the accessory position or letting it sit without driving for more than a week or two. It could also be due to a problem with the hybrid system or the inverter, but it\u2019s usually just an issue with the 12-volt SLI (starting, lights, and ignition) battery.\u00a0\nAn assumption some drivers make is that the car will still operate in electric mode since the hybrid battery contains a charge. But that\u2019s unfortunately not the way it works. The 12-volt system is responsible for powering your car\u2019s interior functions, from the radio and HVAC system to the heated seats, power windows, and lights, as well as the safety systems and the ignition. If there\u2019s no power available from the 12-volt battery, your car won\u2019t be able to initiate these systems.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSteps to jumpstart a hybrid car\u00a0\n\nThe process for how to jumpstart a hybrid car isn\u2019t all that different from a typical ICE-powered vehicle. However, at no point should you ever try to jumpstart the hybrid battery pack since it\u2019s a higher-voltage battery and damage or injury could result. Connections with the hybrid system are identified by brightly colored wiring loom, usually orange, and should be avoided.\u00a0\nAlso, the battery is often not accessible under the hood. Many are installed under the rear seat or in the trunk area, but there are boosting or charging points in the engine bay, and you can use these for the process.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s recommended to consult your owner\u2019s manual for any specific instructions to boost your hybrid vehicle and prevent problems. Here\u2019s the basic steps for how to jumpstart a hybrid.\u00a0\n\n1. Ensure all electrical sources are off\n\nFrom the driver\u2019s seat, ensure your lights are off, the ignition is turned off, and the HVAC controls are set to off. Also, you should set the parking brake to guarantee your car won\u2019t start rolling at any point.\n\n2. Lift and secure the hood\n\nThe manufacturer will either have the 12-volt battery installed under the hood or remote terminals to connect your booster too. Lift the hood and secure it with the prop rod. If your hood has gas struts and they don\u2019t keep it up securely, use vice grips on the strut rod to prevent it from falling shut.\n\n3. Locate the jumpstarting point\n\nIf your car has the battery mounted under the hood, you\u2019ll use that for your connections. Typically, the jumpstarting point for a hybrid car will be terminals under a fuse box cover or something similar. Look for a black or red cover that has a conductive metal pole under it. Often it will be marked with a (+) to identify it as the positive terminal.\n\n4. Connect your cables\n\nIf you\u2019re using a jump starter pack, ensure it\u2019s off. Then, connect the red or positive cable to the jumpstarting point or the positive terminal on your battery. Connect the black or negative terminal to an unpainted part on the chassis. A stud on the firewall or crossmember will work fine, or locate another metal part.\nIf you\u2019re using booster cables, connect one end of the cables as described above first. Then, connect the other end of the booster cables to the \u2018donor\u2019 car in a similar fashion with the engine off.\n\n5. Start the engine\n\nTurn the key or press the start button to the ACC or ON setting first to ensure your car has power. Then, crank the engine over. It should fire up within a couple of seconds.\nNext, start the donor car or turn on the battery pack.\n\n6. Remove the jumpstarter\n\nOnce the engine is running, turn off the jump starter, or remove the booster cables from the donor car. Then, take the cables off the terminals on the hybrid car you\u2019ve just boosted.\nIf your battery dies again, there\u2019s a problem that needs to be diagnosed and corrected. It could be as simple as a failed 12-volt battery or it could be a deeper issue.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What kind of battery do you need for your RV?\u00a0",
        "content": "Types of RV batteries\u00a0\n\nGenerally, there are two different types of batteries to think about with RVs: starting batteries and deep cycle batteries.\u00a0\u00a0\nStarting batteries are exactly what they sound like: they\u2019re for firing up the engine so you can drive between home and your camping destinations. It\u2019s a 12-volt battery that\u2019s meant to be maintained either full or nearly full so the high amperage draw from the starter can be fed reliably. In a majority of cases, it\u2019s a lead-acid battery that\u2019s used for starting batteries.\u00a0\nDeep cycle batteries, on the other hand, are specifically designed to be repeatedly discharged and recharged. They are the perfect choice for RVers because they can withstand a greater number of deep discharge-recharge cycles than other types of batteries and typically have a longer lifespan. It powers non-automotive appliances like the refrigerator, lights, and coffee maker among a long list of other things. Two chemistries are prevalent among RV batteries, your commonplace lead-acid battery in a variety of configurations and lithium-ion batteries.\u00a0\n\nHow do RV battery types compare?\u00a0\n\nWhether you\u2019re boondocking or plugging into a full-service campsite makes a difference for the type of battery you need. Lead-acid batteries have been around for decades and are the most commonly used type of battery in RVs. They are relatively inexpensive and widely available, but they do have some downsides:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey are heavy, often two to three times as heavy for the same capacity and application.\u00a0\nThey have a shorter lifespan than lithium-ion batteries. Roughly every three to five years, a lead-acid battery will need to be replaced.\u00a0\nThey may require more maintenance including charge top-ups and, in some situations, electrolyte top-ups.\u00a0\n\nLithium-ion batteries, on the other hand, are a newer technology that has become increasingly popular in RVs in recent years, and for good reason. Benefits can include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey are much lighter than lead-acid batteries.\u00a0\nThey have a longer lifespan, often between six and eight years.\u00a0\nThey also require less maintenance and can be charged more quickly.\u00a0\nThey can handle deeper discharges without affecting their longevity.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0However, lithium-ion batteries are significantly more expensive than lead-acid batteries.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow to choose the right RV battery\u00a0\n\nAmong options for starting batteries, you might find flooded lead-acid, EFB (enhanced flooded battery), or AGM (absorbed glass mat) batteries. EFB and AGM batteries are designed to provide better power storage and delivery for vehicles with high energy needs and electronics as well as better heat resistance.\u00a0\nFor powering your RV\u2019s amenities, you\u2019ll be looking at either a deep cycle lead-acid or lithium-ion battery. That\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re boondocking, and because there\u2019s a high likelihood your RV will sit unused for long stretches of time. With the advancements in technology, lithium-ion batteries are becoming more and more popular among RVers because they offer greater power density, longer lifespan, and less maintenance than lead-acid batteries, but they are more expensive upfront.\u00a0\n\nWhich one is best for you? Here are a few tips for choosing an RV battery:\u00a0\n\nCalculate your power requirements in amp-hours (aH). Each device you\u2019ll be powering will have a rating on it, so you can figure out how much energy you need in a day. Then, expand that to the longest stretch you\u2019ll be without a way to recharge it.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t be underpowered. The last thing you want is for an electric heater to cut out on a chilly night because your battery runs out of energy.\u00a0\nConsider how often you go RVing. If you\u2019re taking one or two short trips a year, lead-acid deep-cycle batteries will probably do the trick quite well. If you\u2019re an avid outdoorsperson or snowbird, get the best, highest-capacity batteries you can afford.\u00a0\n\nFrom starting batteries and deep cycle batteries to lithium-ion options, AutoZone has the RV batteries you need.

        "title": "What Causes Parasitic Drain on Your Car Battery?\u00a0",
        "content": "What is Parasitic Draw?\u00a0\n\nA parasitic draw is a type of electrical current drain that occurs in a vehicle when the ignition is turned off. It is called a parasitic draw because it continues to drain power from the vehicle\u2019s battery, even though the vehicle is not in use. This can be caused by various electrical components that continue to draw power even when the vehicle is turned off, such as the radio, clock, or power windows. It could also be caused by:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA faulty component or wiring issue \u2013 A component that is malfunctioning or has a wiring issue may continue to draw power even when the ignition is turned off. This could include the alternator, starter motor, or ignition switch.\u00a0\nA short circuit \u2013\u00a0 A short circuit can cause a parasitic draw by allowing current to flow through an unintended path.\u00a0\nA stuck relay \u2013 A stuck relay may continue to draw power even when the ignition is turned off.\u00a0\n\nA parasitic draw can be harmful to the vehicle\u2019s battery and may cause it to go dead if it is not addressed. It is important to identify and fix the cause of a parasitic draw to prevent damage to the battery and ensure the vehicle starts properly.\u00a0\n\nHow to Recognize Battery Drain\u00a0\n\nEssentially, if one of the electrical systems isn\u2019t working like you expect it should, it could be an indication of a parasitic draw or load. The most common symptom you\u2019d expect to come across is a dead battery. Obviously, a parasitic battery drain will eventually run down the stored energy and you\u2019ll need to recharge, boost, or replace it to get the car going again.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther symptoms of a battery drain include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInterior lights don\u2019t turn off when the ignition has been turned off. It could be due to any number of conditions including a door switch circuit that\u2019s failed, an interior light switch that\u2019s shorted, or corrosion or resistance in a module. If the interior electronics don\u2019t go to \u2018sleep\u2019 like they\u2019re designed to do, it\u2019s a sign that there\u2019s a parasitic draw.\u00a0\nElectrical systems that aren\u2019t working normally. If the radio keeps playing unexpectedly, the headlights don\u2019t turn off, or the wipers continue going after the key is out of the ignition, it could be due to a component failure or a bad relay.\u00a0\n\nA replacement battery or alternator didn\u2019t fix the problem. If you\u2019ve replaced a failed battery, alternator, or starter motor but the problem re-occurs, it could be due to a parasitic load that\u2019s killing the part.\u00a0\n\nHow to Test for Battery Drain\u00a0\n\nThere are several steps you can follow to test for a parasitic load (also known as a parasitic draw) in a vehicle:\u00a0\n\n1. Start with a fully charged battery\n\nYou could get inconsistent or inaccurate results if the battery isn\u2019t charged. \n\n2. Set up your equipment\n\nConnect the reds lead of the multimeter to the negative cable end of the battery, and the black lead to the battery terminal, then disconnect the cable without breaking this bridge\u2019s connection.  \n\n3. Turn off all electrical components\n\nTurn off all electrical components, including the radio, headlights, and interior lights. Then, wait for the vehicle\u2019s computer modules to go to \u2018sleep\u2019, which normally takes 10 to 15 minutes but could take upward of an hour. \n\n4. Measure the current draw\n\nLook at the multimeter and note the current draw.  \n\nFor newer cars, a reading between 50 milliamps (mA) and 85 mA is considered normal. This amount of draw won\u2019t kill a battery over a week, let alone overnight. If you have a higher draw than 85 mA, particularly if it\u2019s over 100 mA, you should try to track down the source of the draw and fix it.\u00a0\n\nHow to Correct the Issue\u00a0\n\nTesting for a parasitic draw can be tricky, and locating the problem can take time since the parasitic draw might not always be present. If the multimeter indicates excessive draw, begin to track down the problem by pulling fuses and removing relays one at a time until the draw goes away. Once the draw disappears, you\u2019ve likely found where the issue is.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow comes the hardest part: tracing the circuit for the short or identifying if the part has an internal problem. Often, you can start by replacing the part with a known good one before cutting any wiring looms open.",

        "content": "What is a Battery Management System (BMS)\n\nWhat is a BMS? Like any battery, from chemistries including lead-acid and lithium-ion, degradation is a factor that needs to be watched. Over time, batteries will lose the ability to recharge to their original capacity, and it\u2019s the Battery Management System, or BMS, that keeps watch over the battery pack. The BMS is responsible for monitoring all of the factors that contribute to its State of Health, or SoH including the current, voltage, and temperature. It also balances the battery pack to ensure each cell in each module has the same voltage.\nWith the data it monitors and collects, the BMS controls how much charge the battery will accept and projects the range until the battery reaches its discharge limits.\u00a0\n\nWhat causes BMS failure\n\nLike the electronic modules in a car with an internal combustion engine, calibrations can sometimes go off-track. The BMS for battery electric vehicles is typically thrown off when it can\u2019t monitor the battery over a broad State of Charge (SoC) range.\nWhat does that mean? The BMS needs to measure the battery\u2019s health when it\u2019s fully charged as well as at various other charge levels. The BMS does this checkup on the battery\u2019s status when the battery pack is stable, which is usually after it\u2019s been sitting for several hours. That\u2019s when the kinetic energy inside has settled and become consistent across all the cells.\nIf it\u2019s usually plugged into an EV charger immediately after it\u2019s parked, the BMS will only check the battery\u2019s health when it\u2019s fully charged or close to it, and the calibration slowly slips out of its normal values. It also happens if the SoC is kept in a mid range \u2013 say 70% \u2013 and it only goes on short trips.\nIdeally, the BMS would experience the extreme charge ranges occasionally to measure the SoH across a spectrum of charge levels.\n\nSymptoms of a failing BMS\n\nAs an EV battery\u2019s \u2018brain\u2019, the BMS is crucial to maintaining safe and long-lasting performance. Since it\u2019s responsible for keeping tabs on the safety limits, variations in its calibration will usually narrow the window of how the battery can be used.\u00a0\nSymptoms of improper BMS automotive calibrations can include:\u00a0\n\nReduced electric vehicle driving range.\nThe display shows less than 100% when it\u2019s fully charged.\nLonger charging times than normal.\nShorter lifespan of the EV battery.\n\nHow to reset a BMS\n\nFortunately, the BMS calibration can usually be reset. It\u2019s a good idea to perform a BMS reset if your EV doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to get stable readings across a wide range of charge levels. Dealerships may have a procedure that can reset or calibrate the BMS on the spot, but these steps can help bring the BMS data back into normal ranges and restore your range.\n\n1. Bring the battery to a low state of charge\n\nDrive the car until the charge level drops to 10% or below. Single-digit SoC is ideal. When the battery is discharged to this level, the BMS is able to monitor the battery and more accurately determine the lower limits of the discharge rate.\n\n2. Let the battery charge stabilize and monitor\n\nTo ensure the BMS can monitor the EV battery pack, let the battery stabilize for at least an hour while keeping the systems \u2018awake\u2019. All this takes is checking your car in its app or locking or unlocking the door. \n\n3. Charge the car fully\n\nAfter an hour or so, charge the car completely. If you\u2019ve set your battery charge limit below 100%, change it back to 100% so the BMS can calibrate most accurately. \n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Does car battery size matter for my car?\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019re installing batteries into a remote control, a drone, or some other battery-powered device, it will only operate if the correct batteries are used. AA batteries won\u2019t fit into a space for AAA batteries, for example, and a 9-volt battery won\u2019t work in the place of a CR2032 battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile all car batteries operate on 12 volts, vehicles have different electrical demands, available space for a battery, and terminal configuration requirements. The manufacturer equips a vehicle from the factory with a battery that\u2019s suited for its needs, and the same replacement size, orientation, and capacity should be used.\u00a0\u00a0\nBattery sizes are grouped together based on similar criteria including the physical dimensions, the types of terminals, and the overall configuration. While amp-hours (AH) isn\u2019t part of the grouping, there tends to be a correlation due to the dimensions.\u00a0\u00a0\nBattery Council International, or BCI, has introduced Group Sizes for similarly sized batteries. It makes it much easier to shop for a replacement battery since you only need to make sure the BCI Group Size is the same as the one installed from the factory, and it has the same or higher amp-hours as the old one. Every Group Size 35 battery, for instance, will have the same dimensions and terminal configuration.\u00a0\n\nWhat happens if you put the wrong size battery in your car?\u00a0\n\nWhat happens if you put the wrong size battery in your car?\nIf you\u2019ve chosen the wrong battery size, either intentionally or accidentally, fitment can be an issue for your car.\u00a0\u00a0\nPoor physical fit. Choosing a battery that has a larger width or length may mean it doesn\u2019t fit into the battery tray and can\u2019t be secured safely.\u00a0\u00a0Contact with the hood. If the battery is too tall, the battery hold-down may not fit to secure it or the terminals could contact the hood and arc.\u00a0The battery cables might not reach. If the BCI Group Size you choose has a terminal orientation opposite to your required battery size, the negative and positive cables may not reach the posts.\u00a0Wrong terminal design. Your car might need side posts and won\u2019t work with a top-post battery, or vice versa.\u00a0Damage to electronics. If you connect a battery with reversed polarity, it can damage onboard computers, fry wiring, or cause other serious and expensive electrical issues.\u00a0Insufficient cranking amperage. Selecting a battery that\u2019s too small for your car can impact cold cranking as there isn\u2019t enough stored energy to turn over the engine in cold weather.\u00a0Shortened battery life. If the battery does fit, the wrong size may not have the ability to recharge properly from your alternator. It can lead to sulfation that shortens its useful life.\u00a0\u00a0\nDoes car battery size matter? Yes, it does! While there might be a few compatible batteries, like a Group Size 26R and 35, there are very few matches that have the same physical dimensions and amp-hours that will work for your vehicle.\u00a0\n\nHow to know what car battery size to buy?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTo select the correct size, determine the BCI Group Size that your vehicle was equipped with from the factory. You\u2019ll find this number in a few locations:\u00a0\u00a0\nOn the battery label\u00a0In your vehicle\u2019s service information\u00a0On a BCI Group Size chart\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a battery sizes chart with dimensions for many of the popular BCI Group Sizes.\n\nPASSENGER CAR AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL_BATTERIES 12-VOLT (6 CELLS)\n\nGroupMillimeters\u00a0\u00a0Inches\u00a0\u00a0NumberLWHLWH212081732228\u00a0 3/166 13/168 3/422F2411752119 1/26 7/88\u00a0 5/1622HF2411752299 1/26 7/8922NF2401402279\u00a0 7/165 1/28 15/1622R22917521196 7/88\u00a0 5/162426017322510 1/46 13/168 7/824F27317322910 3/46 13/16924H26017323810 1/46 13/169 3/824R26017322910 1/46 13/16924T26017324810 1/46 13/169 3/4252301752259\u00a0 1/166 7/88 7/8262081731978\u00a0 3/166 13/167 3/426R2081731978\u00a0 3/166 13/167 3/42730617322512\u00a0 1/166 13/168 7/827F31817322712 1/26 13/168 15/1627H29817323511 3/46 13/169 1/429NF330140227135 1/28 15/163333817323813\u00a0 5/166 13/169 3/83426017320010 1/46 13/167 7/834R26017320010 1/46 13/167 7/8352301752259\u00a0 1/166 7/88 7/836R26318320610 3/87 1/48 1/840R27717517510 15/166 7/86 7/84129317517511\u00a0 3/166 7/86 7/8422431731739\u00a0 5/166 13/166 13/164333417520513 1/86 7/88\u00a0 1/16452401402279\u00a0 7/165 1/28 15/164627317322910 3/46 13/169472461751909 11/166 7/87 1/24830617519212\u00a0 1/166 7/87\u00a0 9/1649381175192156 7/87\u00a0 3/165034312725413 1/2510512381292239 3/85\u00a0 1/168 13/1651R2381292239 3/85\u00a0 1/168 13/16521861472107\u00a0 5/165 13/168 1/453330119210134 11/168 1/4541861542127\u00a0 5/166\u00a0 1/168 3/8552181542128 5/86\u00a0 1/168 3/856254154212106\u00a0 1/168 3/8572051831778\u00a0 1/167\u00a0 3/166 15/165825518317710\u00a0 1/167\u00a0 3/166 15/1658R25518317710\u00a0 1/167\u00a0 3/166 15/165925519319610\u00a0 1/167 5/87 3/46033216022513\u00a0 1/166\u00a0 5/168 7/8611921622257\u00a0 9/166 3/88 7/8622251622258 7/86 3/88 7/86325816222510\u00a0 3/166 3/88 7/86429616222511 11/166 3/88 7/86530619019212\u00a0 1/167 1/27\u00a0 9/16702081791968\u00a0 3/167\u00a0 1/167 11/16712081792168\u00a0 3/167\u00a0 1/168 1/2722301792109\u00a0 1/167\u00a0 1/168 1/4732301792169\u00a0 1/167\u00a0 1/168 1/27426018422210 1/47 1/48 3/4752301791969\u00a0 1/167\u00a0 1/167 11/167633417921613 1/87\u00a0 1/168 1/27826017919610 1/47\u00a0 1/167 11/16852301732039\u00a0 1/166 13/168862301732039\u00a0 1/166 13/168902461751759 11/166 7/86 7/891280175175116 7/86 7/89231717517512 1/26 7/86 7/893354175175156 7/86 7/895R39417519015\u00a0 9/166 7/87 1/296R2421731759\u00a0 9/166 13/166 7/897R2521751909 15/166 7/87 1/298R28317519011\u00a0 3/166 7/87 1/2\n\nPASSENGER CAR AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL BATTERIES 6-VOLT(3 CELLS)\n\nGroupMillimeters\u00a0\u00a0Inches\u00a0\u00a0NumberLWHLWH12321812389 1/87 1/89 3/8226418123810 3/87 1/89 3/82E49210523219\u00a0 7/164 1/89 1/82N254141227105\u00a0 9/168 15/1617HF1871752297 3/86 7/89\n\nHEAVY-DUTY COMMERCIAL BATTERIES 12-VOLT (6 CELLS)\n\nGroupMillimeters\u00a0\u00a0Inches\u00a0\u00a0NumberLWHLWH4D52722225020 3/48 3/49 7/86D52725426020 3/41010 1/48D52728325020 3/411 1/89 7/82826117324010\u00a0 5/166 13/169\u00a0 7/1629H33417123213 1/86 3/49 1/8 1030H34317323513 1/26 13/169 1/4 1031330173240136 13/189\u00a0 7/16\n\nELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERIES 6-VOLT (3CELLS)\n\nGroupMillimeters\u00a0\u00a0Inches\u00a0\u00a0NumberLWHLWHGC226418327010 3/87\u00a0 3/1610 5/8GC2H26418329510 3/87\u00a0 3/1611 5/8",

        "title": "What You Need to Know About Car Battery Voltage",
        "content": "What is Voltage?\u00a0\n\nIn layman\u2019s terms, voltage is the pressure from a power source that pushes current (charged electrons) through a conducting loop, which allows them to do work. Or, to put it even more simply, voltage is the amount of electrical potential that a battery has.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis is important in cars, because a certain amount of voltage is required to turn on your vehicle. There\u2019s a reason that your vehicle relies on a large, bulky battery under the hood and not some tiny AAA batteries. In order to start, your car needs more power than a small battery can provide, and that power is displayed by voltage.\u00a0\nHow Much Voltage Does Your Car Battery Have?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStandard car batteries are listed as 12-volt batteries. However, this is rounding down, as a car battery should have a \u201cresting voltage\u201d \u2013 which is to say, the amount of voltage it has when it\u2019s turned off \u2013 of 12.6 volts. That voltage increases when the car is running. Once your vehicle is up and running, the alternator powers the electrical elements in the vehicle, like the lights, stereo, power windows, and power seats. The alternator is also responsible for charging the battery, so that it\u2019s fully prepared for the next time you turn on your car. With all that extra electrical current from the alternator, a car\u2019s battery usually has a voltage of 13.5 to 14.5 when running.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow Much Voltage Does a Car Battery Need?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA battery needs the bulk of its voltage in order to function properly. While some people think that a battery has to get down to zero volts before it stops working, the reality is that a car battery can\u2019t dip too far below 12 volts before it\u2019s unable to perform its duties and turn your vehicle on.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a car battery voltage chart that correlates a battery\u2019s voltage to its life, to help display how many volts are really needed to keep your car running happily.\u00a0\nVoltage\u00a0State of the Battery\u2019s Charge\u00a0\u00a012.6 or higher\u00a0100%\u00a012.5\u00a090%\u00a012.42\u00a080%\u00a012.32\u00a070%\u00a012.2\u00a060%\u00a012.06\u00a050%\u00a011.9\u00a040%\u00a011.75\u00a030%\u00a011.58\u00a020%\u00a011.31\u00a010%\u00a010.5 or lower\u00a0Dead\u00a0\n\nHow to Test Your Car\u2019s Voltage\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhile you can always take your car to a mechanic (or an oil change spot) to have the voltage checked, it\u2019s an easy task to do at home. All you\u2019ll need is a multimeter or a voltmeter, both of which are quite affordable.\u00a0\u00a0\nStart by turning the car off, and removing the battery\u2019s positive terminal cover. At this point, it\u2019s a smart idea to check the battery\u2019s terminal for corrosion and clean off any that you spot. Next, attach the positive lead of the multimeter or voltmeter to the positive lead of the battery, and then attach the negative lead of the multimeter or voltmeter to the negative lead of the battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow you\u2019ll want to turn the key of the car to the run position, and get a reading on the multimeter or voltmeter. This will tell you the car\u2019s voltage. It should be sitting between 12.6 and 12.8, though it can be a little bit lower depending on the weather. If the voltage is above 12.8, you should drain the battery a little bit by using the electrical components before turning it on. If the voltage reads below 12.6, you probably need to charge your battery.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat Causes a Battery to Lose Voltage?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe primary reason that a battery loses voltage is time and use. Since voltage is a current, it doesn\u2019t get used up when you use your battery, the way your car uses up gas. However, the frequent generation of power results in the battery\u2019s chemicals slowly turning into different chemicals. Those chemicals are less capable of providing power, and the voltage in the car\u2019s battery will begin to drop.\u00a0\u00a0\nMost lead-acid batteries need to be replaced every three to five years, because sooner or later the voltage will start to run dry. If you have an EFB or AGM battery, its lifespan might stretch by an extra year or two.\u00a0\n\nWhat Are the Signs of a Weak Battery?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhile you can use multimeters and voltmeters to determine the voltage in your car\u2019s battery, your car will also usually give you a fair amount of warning signs when the voltage is beginning to dwindle, and the battery is starting to go.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou might notice some electrical issues with the car, such as headlights that are too dim, or flickering, or power windows that are moving more slowly than usual, or poor sound quality from the stereo. Sometimes those electrical components simply won\u2019t work at all if the battery is fading.\u00a0\nBut the most sure sign of a weak battery is trouble starting your car. If the vehicle won\u2019t turn on, that\u2019s usually a sign of a battery that is dead or dying. If the car will turn on, but it takes a few tries or starts on a delay, then the battery is probably fairly weak.",

        "title": "What is an AGM Battery?",
        "content": "Introduction to AGM Batteries\n\nAGM stands for Absorbent Glass Mat, which is a key feature that differentiates this battery type from others. AGM batteries belong to the family of Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA) batteries. Unlike conventional flooded lead-acid batteries, AGM batteries utilize a special design that enhances their performance, safety, and reliability.\nThe core component of an AGM battery is a glass mat separator that is saturated with electrolyte. This thin, absorbent mat is placed between the battery\u2019s positive and negative plates, ensuring a more efficient and controlled flow of ions during charge and discharge cycles.\n\nHow AGM Batteries Work\n\nUnderstanding how AGM batteries work is crucial to appreciating their advantages and applications. AGM batteries operate on the same basic principles as traditional lead-acid batteries but with some notable differences:\n\nAbsorption. During charging, the glass mat absorbs and retains the electrolyte, preventing spillage and making AGM batteries maintenance-free. This also means they can be installed in various positions, including on their side, without the risk of leakage.\nRecombination. AGM batteries employ a unique recombination process. As gas is produced during charging and discharging \u2013 a process that\u2019s normal conditions for all batteries \u2013 it is recombined within the battery rather than being released into the atmosphere. This minimizes the need for topping up the electrolyte.\nLow Internal Resistance. AGM batteries have lower internal resistance compared to flooded lead-acid batteries. This results in quicker charging and discharging, making them ideal for high-demand applications.\n\nAdvantages of AGM Batteries\n\nAGM batteries offer several compelling advantages over traditional lead-acid batteries:\n\nMaintenance-Free. One of the most significant benefits of AGM batteries is that they are maintenance-free. They don\u2019t require regular topping up of electrolyte, making them hassle-free to maintain.\nDeep Cycle Capabilities. AGM batteries are well-suited for deep cycle applications, such as powering RVs, boats, and off-grid systems. They can handle frequent deep discharges without suffering from the \u201cmemory effect.\u201d\nQuick Charging. AGM batteries have a high charge acceptance rate, allowing them to recharge rapidly. This is especially advantageous in applications where quick power recovery is essential, such as in auto start-stop applications.\nLeak-Proof Design. The sealed design of AGM batteries prevents acid leakage, making them safer to handle and suitable for confined spaces.\nVibration Resistance. AGM batteries are highly resistant to vibration and shock, making them ideal for use in vehicles where constant motion is a factor, like in off-roading.\n\nApplications of AGM Batteries\n\nAGM batteries find applications across various industries and use cases.\n\nAutomotive. AGM batteries are commonly used in modern vehicles, providing reliable starting power and supporting advanced electronics and accessories.\nMarine. Boat owners appreciate AGM batteries for their ability to withstand the rigors of marine environments while delivering consistent power for essential onboard systems.\nRVs and Campers. AGM batteries are a popular choice for recreational vehicles due to their deep cycle capabilities and resistance to jolts and vibrations.\nSolar Power Systems. AGM batteries serve as energy storage solutions in off-grid and grid-tied solar power systems, storing excess energy generated during the day for nighttime use.\nEmergency Backup. They are also used as backup power sources for critical applications like medical equipment, telecommunications, and security systems.\n\nAGM vs. Lead-Acid Batteries: A Comparison\n\nTo better appreciate the advantages of AGM batteries, let\u2019s compare them to traditional flooded lead-acid batteries.\n\nMaintenance. AGM batteries are maintenance-free, while lead-acid batteries require regular electrolyte topping up.\nPositioning. AGM batteries can be installed in various positions, including sideways or upside down, without the risk of acid leakage. All other types of lead-acid batteries must be upright.\nDeep Cycling. AGM batteries excel in deep cycle applications, whereas standard lead-acid batteries are better suited for starting and shallow cycling.\nCharging Speed. AGM batteries charge faster due to their lower internal resistance, whereas lead-acid batteries have a slower charge rate.\nVibration Resistance. AGM batteries are highly resistant to vibrations, making them suitable for vehicles and boats. Lead-acid batteries may suffer from plate damage in such conditions.\n\nKey Considerations before Switching to AGM Batteries\n\nBefore making the switch to AGM batteries, consider the following:\n\nCompatibility. Ensure that your vehicle or system is compatible with AGM batteries. Check your owner\u2019s manual or consult a professional if needed.\nCharging System. Not all vehicles can properly charge an AGM battery. Verify that your charging system can accommodate AGM batteries to maximize their lifespan, or you could be replacing it sooner than you expect.\nCost. AGM batteries are typically more expensive upfront than traditional lead-acid batteries. Evaluate the long-term benefits and cost savings to determine if they are the right choice for your needs.\n\nMaintenance and Care of AGM Batteries\n\nWhile AGM batteries are low maintenance, there are still some care guidelines to follow:\n\nCharge Regularly. Avoid leaving AGM batteries in a discharged state for extended periods. Charge them regularly, even during storage.\nProper Charging. Use a battery charger designed for AGM batteries to prevent overcharging or undercharging. Many standard chargers aren\u2019t designed to charge AGM batteries well.\nClean Terminals.

        "title": "Why Does My Battery Keep Dying?",
        "content": "Car Battery Life\n\nModern batteries have a typical operational life of between three and five years, but many can last beyond that if you keep them charged and maintain the connections. The older a battery is, the more likely you will begin to see issues with slow startup, or even electrical gremlins with accessories in the vehicle, so it\u2019s wise to replace your vehicle battery before it dies completely.\n\nCan I Test My Own Battery?\n\nThe good news is that you can do some quick battery tests in your own home, with some basic tools, that will assess whether the battery is at fault or perhaps you have an issue somewhere else in the vehicle\u2019s electrical system. Follow this guide to do a basic check on your battery.\n\nComplete a visual inspection\n\nOften, mechanics can diagnose a problem simply by looking under the hood. If you see loose wiring, a frayed or severed cable, or even corrosion on the battery terminals, you may have found what drains the car battery. Replace any broken cables or connections, if you can, and clean the battery terminals and cable connections with a wire brush before applying some dielectric grease and reconnecting everything. It is surprising how many battery issues can be solved with a simple cleaning like this.\n\nTest the voltage\n\nTesting your car battery with a multimeter\nIf that doesn\u2019t solve your problem, use a multimeter to test the voltage on the battery. A multimeter is an electronic tool that can measure voltage and amperage from a variety of sources, so it\u2019s very useful to have around the house. Start by disconnecting the negative cable on the battery. Then set the multimeter to 20V on the direct current (DCV) mode and measure the voltage across the negative and positive battery terminals. If the voltage reading is between 12.4 and 12.6 volts, your battery is charged properly, and any electrical issues lie elsewhere in the system. If the voltage is below 12.4V, charge the battery fully and repeat the test.\n\nCheck the charging system\n\nOne other possibility is that your alternator is not functioning up to specifications and leaving your battery weak, even after long drives. To test your charging system (the alternator), have a friend start the vehicle and keep the engine RPMs at a steady 2,000. Place your multimeter leads on the positive and negative battery terminals to measure the voltage. If you are seeing between 13.5 and 14.5 volts, then your alternator is doing its job.\n\nShould I Get a Trickle Charger?\n\nCharging a battery with duralst battery charger\nA trickle charger is a cheap way to increase the service life of your car battery by keeping it fully charged. In modern cars, there are so many electrical draws that even continue when the vehicle is turned off, so batteries take a beating. If you live in a climate with extreme temperatures, your battery will also live a rough life, so keeping it charged with an intelligent trickle charger is a smart move.\n\nFAQ",

        "title": "How to Charge a Car Battery",
        "content": "How a Battery is Designed\n\nCar batteries are designed very similar to household batteries, with a positive electrode, a negative electrode, an electrolyte, and a separator. The electrodes, known as the anode and the cathode, are highly conductive, which allows energy to pass between them. Power comes into the battery through the anode (the negative end), and out through the cathode (the positive end).\nOn the outside of the battery, both the positive and negative terminals are placed on top, or at the top of one side, of the battery, as this design allows you to easily access both terminals without removing the battery from the car. As such, you can easily charge a car battery while it is still under the hood.\n\nWhat Charging a Battery Does Inside\n\nThe process of charging a battery is fairly simple. Electrical charge enters the battery from an outside source, typically the alternator when the engine is running, which activates a chemical reaction inside the battery. That chemical reaction is converted into electrical energy, which is stored inside the battery\u2019s cells.\u00a0\n\nSteps to Properly Charge a Battery\u00a0\n\nNormally your car\u2019s battery is charged by the alternator. When your car is running, the alternator is the main source of electrical power. Most of the electrical features, like the stereo, headlights, interior lights, and power windows, are powered by the alternator. In addition to powering those electrical components, the alternator sends power to the battery to charge it. That way your battery should be fully charged when you turn your car off, and thus capable of doing its job and getting your car turned back on when you next use it.\u00a0\nHowever, if your car battery isn\u2019t charged enough to turn the car on, then you certainly can\u2019t rely on the alternator to charge the battery, because alternators only run when the engine is running. When that happens, you\u2019ll have to charge the battery yourself. There are two main ways to do this.\n\nUsing a Battery Charger\n\nThe first is the traditional way: by using a battery charger.\u00a0\nWith all of the electronics in the car turned off, disconnect the negative battery cable, then disconnect the positive battery cable.\u00a0Make sure that the cables are not resting near each other, as you don\u2019t want them touching.\u00a0You\u2019ll probably need a socket wrench when disconnecting the cables.\u00a0Next, clean the battery terminals using a battery brush or a battery cleaning solution.\u00a0Now it\u2019s time to use your battery charger. Different chargers might have different instructions, so read through the manual first, but in general, they all work pretty much the same.\u00a0With the charger turned off, connect the positive cable from the charger to the battery\u2019s positive terminal, then do the same with the negative cable and negative terminal.\u00a0Then turn the battery charger on, and it will begin the process of charging the battery.\u00a0Once the charging is complete, turn off the charger and remove the cables from the battery terminals.\u00a0Reconnect the car\u2019s battery cables, and again be sure to do the positive cable first, and the negative cable second. Then you\u2019re good to go.\n\nJump Start the Car\n\nThe other way to charge a battery is by jump-starting your car. To do this, you\u2019ll need a pair of jumper cables and a second car, or you\u2019ll need a portable jump starter.\u00a0\nIf using another car, park that car with the hood near your car\u2019s battery. Clamp one end of the red jumper cables to the positive terminal on the dead battery, then clamp the other end to the positive terminal on the working battery. Then clamp one end of the black cable to the negative terminal on the working battery, and clamp the other end to a metal bracket on the car with the dead battery. Turn on the car with the working battery, then turn on the car with the dead battery. Once the car is running, disconnect the negative cables followed by the positive cables.\u00a0\nIf using a portable jump starter, the process is essentially the same, but without a second car. Instead, you\u2019ll just have to press a button, then turn on your car.\u00a0\nOnce your car is running, you\u2019ll need to run it for at least 15 to 30 minutes so that the alternator has time to charge the battery. If you just turn your car off as soon as you jump-start it, it probably won\u2019t turn back on.\u00a0\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Charge a Battery?\u00a0\n\nIt depends entirely on how powerful your charger is, and how dead the battery is. In general, it usually takes around 12 hours to fully charge a car battery with a charger at a slow and steady rate. If you\u2019re jumping the car, it usually is instantaneous to get the car running, and then takes 30 minutes of running the vehicle before the battery is mostly charged.\u00a0\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "What Are Deep Cycle Batteries?",
        "content": "What Is a Deep Cycle Battery?\nDeep cycle batteries will oftentimes look like a car battery to people who are unfamiliar with them. However, the two battery types are pretty different. Deep cycle batteries are lead batteries specifically designed to provide long-term energy to the objects powered by the battery. These types of batteries are rechargeable and will usually operate effectively until 80% of the energy they have stored is depleted. The deep cycle battery gets its name from the extra-thick plates it possesses that allow it to endure more discharge cycles than other types of batteries.\nDeep Cycle Battery Uses\nThe sustained energy provided by deep cycle batteries is perfect for applications that favor a long-term energy supply over a battery that provides a quick start. If you are a boat owner, it is likely you use a deep cycle battery to power your craft. Many consider it to be the best boat battery. Other deep cycle battery uses include:\nGolf cartsForklifts (and other vehicles used in material handling)Recreational vehiclesMarine applicationsRenewable energy (made available off-grid)\nHybrid batteries are sometimes used and are most popular for marine applications. Hybrid batteries provide sustained power that is the norm for deep cycle batteries but also deliver the added benefit of a starter burst. However, hybrid batteries will not last as long as a deep life battery specifically designed for longevity in most cases. Let\u2019s look at the most commonly used deep cycle batteries: the flooded and deep valve battery types.\nFlooded Deep Cycle Batteries\nThe first type of deep cycle battery is a flooded deep cycle battery. These are not very different from the standard lead-acid car batteries. This battery is currently referred to as a \u201cwet-cell\u201d battery and is the oldest and most commonly used deep cycle battery type. \nFlooded batteries will require more maintenance than other battery types due to the liquid contained within the batteries. Flooded deep cycle battery owners will need to refill the battery\u2019s liquid container with distilled water when the electrolyte levels inside the battery are low. \nAdvantages: Flooded deep cycle batteries are cheap to purchase and are designed in a way that makes their use and repair relatively simple. The flooded battery type also provides a huge energy surge that can be applied to a wide variety of uses.Disadvantages: The unsealed battery case will allow electrolytes to leak out if care is not taken. The propensity for leakage also means that extra precaution is needed whenever a flooded deep cycle battery is transported in a vehicle. The trade-off for the high energy surge possessed by the battery is low energy density. Remember to position your battery in a well-ventilated place when charging to compensate for the hydrogen that will be released.\nValve Regulated Deep Cycle Batteries\nThe next answer to the question \u201cwhat is a deep cycle battery?\u201d is the valve regulated deep cycle battery. This is also commonly referred to as a sealed lead-acid battery and does not possess the need to be watered. Sealed batteries do not require the maintenance that is necessary with other types of batteries but should still be routinely monitored. \nThe \u201crecombinant\u201d feature of the battery signifies that both oxygen and hydrogen are present within the battery. The valve possessed by this deep cycle battery type is activated when the high voltage is used to recharge the battery. When the valve is activated, materials inside the battery make an exit and the battery capacity is decreased. The two types of valve regulated deep cycle batteries available are the AGM and gel varieties.\nHow to Charge a Deep Cycle Battery Properly\nIndividuals searching for information on how to charge a boat battery should first understand the need to ensure the battery is dust- and corrosion-free. You should also make sure the battery charger you buy is capable of providing the amperage your deep cycle battery needs in a time frame that is acceptable. A charger that is not well-suited for your battery will not provide you with an adequate charge for your boat battery and may do damage to it.\nRatings for Deep Cycle Batteries\nOne common rating that will help consumers decide the best boat battery for them is \u201camp hours.\u201d This rating informs battery users of how much amperage is available to them during one complete hour of battery usage. Amp hours for deep cycle batteries measure the capacity for the chemical energy that exists within the battery to be converted to electrical energy. An amp hour rating will also provide users with a measure of how much battery usage they can enjoy before a recharge is necessary.\nLife Span of Deep Cycle Batteries\nIt is important to understand that many manufacturers choose to measure the life span of their batteries by cycles and not solely in calendar years. A cycle represents a single and complete discharge of a battery. The manner in which your battery is used, charged, and maintained will affect the amount of use you enjoy per cycle. \nWhen performing your calculations, you should remember that it is never a good idea to allow a 100% discharge of your deep cycle battery as you will have an even greater need to know how to charge a boat battery. The specific life span you can expect will be ultimately determined by your usage habits and other factors particular to your unique situation. However, you can ensure you enjoy maximum possible battery life by properly maintaining your battery. You should provide water as needed and adhere to the recommendation that your battery is never discharged by more than 50%. \n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "How to Protect Your Car Battery from the Cold",
        "content": "Why does the cold affect car batteries?\nThere are a few reasons why cold weather can affect car batteries. One is that the battery itself is temperature sensitive. When it\u2019s cold outside, the battery fluid can freeze and expand if it\u2019s low on charge, which can damage the battery cells.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the chemical reaction that produces electricity slows down in cold weather, so the battery doesn\u2019t produce as much power. Cold weather can also make it harder for the engine to turn over, which puts additional strain on the battery. All of these factors can combine to cause car batteries to fail in cold weather.\u00a0\n\nWays to prevent a dead battery in winter\nNo one wants to spend their time asking a Google mechanic, \u201cWhy won\u2019t my car start in the cold?\u201d It\u2019s so much easier if you prevent the problem before it starts. And like other car maintenance and operating best practices, prevention is always preferred.\u00a0\n\nKeep it charged\n\nOne of the most important things to do in winter is to keep your car battery charged. A dead battery is one of the most common reasons for a car to not start in cold weather. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to keep a battery charged in winter without a little help.\u00a0\nIf you drive short trips often, the high strain on your battery during start cycles might take longer for the alternator to replenish than your drive. To help out, put a trickle charger on your car\u2019s battery overnight once per week. That should help to keep it topped up.\n\nDrive your car often\n\nIn winter, it\u2019s important to keep your car\u2019s battery charged so that it will start in cold weather. But how much do you need to drive to keep the battery charged? Experts recommend driving for at least 30 minutes once a week. This will help to keep the battery topped off and prevent it from being damaged by the cold weather. Even 10 to 15 minutes of driving can make a difference. Just be sure to turn off your headlights and other accessories if possible so that you\u2019re not putting extra strain on the battery and putting as much charge directly to it.\n\nPark in warm, protected places\n\nYou can also try to park in a garage or other sheltered spot whenever possible. This will protect your battery from the cold and help to prolong its lifespan. Although your car doesn\u2019t feel the windchill factor like your skin does, parking in an unheated garage still has an insulating factor that helps retain heat longer. And if you have access, heated parking is fantastic for reducing the cranking effort and keeping your battery warm, inevitably helping it last longer.\n\nTest your car battery\n\nYour car needs a healthy battery to start the engine and work your accessories \u2013 heater motor, windshield wipers, and radio, especially. An older car battery loses its capacity over the years in normal conditions, and that can affect whether your battery will work for you in the cold. An old or sulfated battery can charge to normal levels or around 12.6 volts, but the cold cranking amperage and reserve capacity might be much lower than it\u2019s rated for.\u00a0\n\nInstall a new battery\n\nHow to Install a Battery\n\nAnd if your car\u2019s battery keeps dying on you, it becomes a safety issue as well as an inconvenience. Rather than hoping for a jump-start when it happens, install a new car battery. Ensure you choose the correct size and capacity for your car by finding a Group Size that\u2019s intended to fit just like the original. It has the same terminal orientations, same physical dimensions, and cranking amps and reserve capacity that meet or exceed your car\u2019s needs.\u00a0\n\nBest car battery for cold weather\n\nThe best cold weather car battery is one that\u2019s rated the same as your factory\u2019s battery, or better. Look for the same Group Size as the old one so that it fits like it should.\u00a0\nAside from physical size, a cold weather car battery will have higher cold cranking amps (CCA) than the original battery did. That means that when the mercury plummets, the battery will still have enough energy to turn the engine over. Reserve capacity is also important to keep track of since it can determine if your battery has plenty of power if you need to try starting several times in a row.\u00a0\nGreat choices for winter-ready batteries include Duralast Premium EFB and AGM batteries that recharge quickly with the engine running and tend to last longer than other options. Spiral-cell AGM batteries from OPTIMA also rank highly for cold weather operation.\u00a0\nIf you need help finding the right battery for your car, AutoZone can help.

        "title": "How to use a portable jump starter",
        "content": "What is a portable jump starter?\n\nIn a situation where you jump-start a dead battery on a car, truck, boat, RV, or motorcycle, you connect booster cables from the terminals of the recovery vehicle to the dead battery\u2019s posts. It uses the donor\u2019s battery storage and alternator\u2019s power generation to quickly enable a start.\u00a0\nEssentially, a portable jump starter does a similar function without needing a second vehicle. It\u2019s more convenient, faster, and its size makes it perfect to use remotely and take with you when there\u2019s no help around for miles.\u00a0\nInside the jump starter is a compact yet powerful battery that can often start an engine more than a dozen times over without being recharged. Two leads come out the side \u2013 a red positive lead and a black negative lead \u2013 that clamp to your battery terminals without worrying that you\u2019ve mixed up the order between the vehicles. It\u2019s almost foolproof, and you\u2019re unlikely to fry any electronics with it.\u00a0\nThe massive price range is due to the power capacity and other options the portable car jump starter contains. One of the main determiners is the type of battery it possesses. Lead-acid and lithium-ion jump starters are the two main variants, and Li-ion is smaller, more powerful, and lighter, thus it\u2019s more expensive.\nSome higher-end boosters can jump-start 6-volt, 12-volt, and 24-volt systems. Others have USB chargers built in, or they could have LED work lights, and others yet have an inverter to power 110-volt household devices. While some are simply jump starters, others are multi-tools.\n\nHow to use a portable jump starter\n\nTime needed:\u00a030 minutesAs with any equipment you purchase, read the instructions to get specific directions on its functions and safe operation. Using a portable jump starter is something every driver should know, and it\u2019s a great idea to test it out before you actually need it in a time-sensitive situation. Charge it up Most portable jump starters come with some juice in the battery when it\u2019s delivered, but charge it fully before you need it. Usually, it\u2019s a common household plug and a port on the side of the device. Figure out your connections Some booster packs have hardwired cables while others have quick-attach options. Determine which connectors you will need and get your jump starter set up. Attach the cables Connect your jump starter to the battery directly, if you can. Clamp the red cable to the positive (+) post on the battery and the black cable to the negative (-) post. Often, you\u2019ll get an indicator light up or a tone if you\u2019ve connected it wrong. Place it in a safe location Prop the device up so that it won\u2019t be in the way of moving parts when the engine starts. Turn it on If there\u2019s a power switch, now\u2019s when you turn it on. Never turn a portable jump starter on before it\u2019s connected properly and you\u2019re about to crank the engine over. Start the engine Crank the engine over until it starts. If the problem was battery power, your engine should fire right up. Disconnect the jump starter With the engine running, turn off the power switch (if equipped) and carefully disconnect the cables from the battery posts. \nIf you\u2019re looking to charge a USB device like a smartphone or power a small appliance like a toaster while you\u2019re camping, use the outlets like you normally would at home. For some portable car jump starter packs, you won\u2019t need to turn the power switch on while for others you will.\u00a0\n\nBattery chargers vs. portable jump starters\n\nPortable jump starters are fantastic in a pinch, but there\u2019s a reason you have a dead battery you need to boost. Plenty of drivers will boost the battery and just drive, hoping to replenish the charge. In some cases, this works, but not always. It can result in sulfation or a surface charge that could leave you stranded again.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s best to use a battery charger to fully charge your car\u2019s battery as soon as you\u2019re able. These devices meter power at a slow, steady rate so your battery\u2019s health isn\u2019t compromised.\u00a0\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Car Won\u2019t Start with New Battery? Here\u2019s What to Check",
        "content": "What the battery really does\n\nMost car owners and drivers believe that the battery powers your car\u2019s electronics, modules, and engine while you drive. That might be true to a very small extent, but the main power source while the engine is running is the alternator, delivering electricity on demand while recharging the battery.\nA car battery\u2019s main purpose is as a power reserve for when the engine isn\u2019t on. It\u2019s called on every time you crank the engine over, delivering a powerful, high-amperage current to the engine starter to crank it over. And once the key is shut off again but in the accessory or ON position, it continues to power computer modules, the infotainment system, the heater fan, memory and remote functions, and the lights.\nSo, if you\u2019ve installed a new battery in your car, why would it be dead? Here are some causes to consider.\n\nCheck if the battery is properly installed\n\nIf you have a new battery but the car won\u2019t start without jump starting it, it looks like a battery problem. Your instinct to replace the battery \u2013 or your diagnosis \u2013 might\u2019ve been accurate. But if you\u2019ve installed the battery incorrectly, it won\u2019t fix the problem. Check if your battery cables are tight. They shouldn\u2019t be able to move by hand when you wiggle the terminal at the battery posts and, if you can, they need to be re-torqued.\nAn unfortunate yet common problem is installing the battery cables to the wrong posts. If you install the positive cable to the negative post and the negative cable to the positive post, it\u2019s called reversing the polarity. It can damage the alternator, short the battery, cause wiring to melt, and will almost certainly blow one or more fuses.\n\nAccidently leaving the exterior or interior lights on\n\nFor older cars that don\u2019t have automatic lights, it\u2019s easy to leave the headlights, marker lights, or the interior lights on. Sometimes, the light switch gets turned or bumped and you don\u2019t notice the lights on. You\u2019ll have a dead battery, and if you change it, it will start up right away. But if you don\u2019t turn the lights off, you could easily have a dead battery again.\nThe fix is fast and easy. Fully charge the battery and check to see if there are any lights on. When you turn them off, the electrical draw stops.\n\nBad Starter\n\nThe engine starter is a powerful electric motor, and if it fails, you\u2019ll often only hear a click. Coincidentally, that\u2019s often all you hear when you have a dead battery. A bad starter could mimic a dead battery, and when you change it, it doesn\u2019t fix a bad starter, obviously.\nIf you\u2019ve already installed a new battery and the car won\u2019t start \u2013 just clicks once loudly \u2013 it could be the starter motor is faulty.\n\nBlown Fuse or Relay\n\nSometimes, the problem is so simple that you overlook it. A blown starter fuse or relay could be all that\u2019s causing the issue. It happens when one of the components on the circuit is drawing more power than it should.\nSwitch the starter relay with another known good one and try again. If it starts, you\u2019ve found the problem. If not, check the starter fuse, again, swapping it with a good one to see if that\u2019s all that\u2019s wrong. But don\u2019t forget, if you have a blown fuse, there\u2019s likely an underlying cause to watch for.\n\nAlternator Problems\n\nA new battery that won\u2019t hold a charge while you drive almost always indicates a bad alternator. Perhaps the serpentine belt is shredded, or maybe the battery\u2019s been jump started with reversed polarity. An alternator that doesn\u2019t put out any charge or very little current won\u2019t sustain your car\u2019s electronics, let alone recharge the battery.\n\nEngine Issues\n\nIf you\u2019ve replaced your battery but the engine still won\u2019t start, it could actually be an engine problem. A seized engine won\u2019t turn over, and that often resembles a bad starter or dead battery.\nIf you suspect that your problem stems from an engine issue, it could take hours to diagnose and repair. It might be something you\u2019d like to hand off to a Preferred Shop to help you out.\n\nParasitic Draw\n\nIf you find your new car battery dead after it\u2019s been parked for only a few hours or days, you could have a parasitic draw. That\u2019s when a circuit or electrical part continues to draw power even when it should be turned off. A parasitic draw requires specialized knowledge to trace circuits and identify the underlying problem. Although it might be the root cause, your battery replacement was probably still warranted since fully discharging a battery can reduce its lifespan.\nIf you\u2019ve got electrical problems that are beyond your purview, we can help.

        "title": "Can a Car Run with a Bad Alternator?",
        "content": "How Long Can I Drive with a Bad Alternator?\n\nThe amount of time you have before the car completely dies will depend on how much charge the battery had before the alternator failed, how many accessories you have running in the car, and the driving conditions. It\u2019s also important to note that many newer vehicles use electricity to power engine cooling fans, power steering, and a host of other systems, so the power drain can happen very quickly. Your best bet is to pick up and install a new alternator immediately or get to a service center as quickly as possible to have it replaced.\n\nPotential Issues Driving with a Faulty Alternator\n\nThere are some potential safety hazards that come when driving with a faulty alternator. The main issue is that most new cars use electrically assisted power-steering and when the power fails, the steering effort goes up quite a bit. This could be very hazardous at highway speeds, especially with inexperienced drivers, or if driving in areas with many curves. You\u2019ll also be doing your battery no favors, since completely draining a battery reduces its service life. If your alternator has quit and the battery charge is depleted, your car could stall, leaving you stranded in traffic.\n\nSigns of a Faulty Alternator\n\nThe faster you recognize the signs that your alternator might be going bad, the better off you\u2019ll be, so it pays to know these signs of a faulty alternator:\n\nYour car won\u2019t start. If your car refuses to start and then dies quickly after being boosted, you may have an alternator issue. If your battery is simply dead (but the alternator is still good), your car should run after being boosted.\nYour headlights are dimmer than usual or are dimming and getting brighter at random intervals. This is a sign that your alternator is providing inconsistent voltage and may fail soon.\u00a0\nYour battery warning light appears on the dash. The \u201cbattery\u201d light actually represents the charging system, not just the battery. If it appears on your dash, you\u2019ll want to check that your alternator is still producing consistent voltage. Most alternators should be producing between 13 and 14.5 volts, if they are operating properly.\u00a0\nYou are hearing strange noises from under the hood of the car. If you hear new rubbing, grinding, or squealing noises from under the hood, it\u2019s a sign that something is wrong. Start by opening up the hood and looking, listening, and smelling for the location of the problem. If you can pinpoint the location, you can start to diagnose many car care issues.\n\nSigns on when to replace your alternator\n\nHow Replace an Alternator\n\nThere is great satisfaction in diagnosing an issue with your car, buying the parts and tools for the job, and successfully completing a repair. Anyone can work on cars. You just need to be patient, remember where you put all your parts, and do a little research before you start. Read on for a general guide on how to replace the alternator in your car.\n\nOrder your alternator according to your car\u2019s year, make, model, and engine size.\u00a0\nDetach the negative cable from your car battery. You\u2019re working on the electrical system of the vehicle, so you don\u2019t want to injure yourself or cause problems with the car due to a short circuit.\nLocate the alternator. They\u2019re usually about the size of half a loaf of bread and it will have a pulley on the front with a belt attached. The belt will probably wind around a bunch of other pulleys on the front of the engine.\nRemove the belt from the alternator pulley. One of the other pulleys on the front of the engine will be a tensioner pulley which is attached to a spring-loaded arm that moves back and forth to keep the belt tight on the rest of the pulleys. Most tensioners have a nut on the front so that you can use a box end wrench or a socket and ratchet to release the tension on the belt. Be careful because if your wrench slips off, the tensioner will spring back quickly and could injure you. If there isn\u2019t a nut on the front of the tensioner, it probably has a female hex key insert that you can use for the same purpose. Some tensioners, often on older cars, are mechanical rather than spring loaded and simply need a bolt loosened.\nDisconnect all the cables that are attached to the alternator. The electrical circuit to the battery will be a wire that is bolted to the alternator. The control circuit will usually use quick connectors that have a tab that you pry back with a little screwdriver while you pull the connector. Be careful not to break the tabs! While you\u2019re taking off the cables, inspect them to make sure they\u2019re in good condition (not cracked or worn).\nRemove the bolts that connect the alternator to the engine. Most alternators will have two to four bolts. Carefully remove the alternator.\nInstallation is the reverse of removal.\nOnce you have the new alternator installed, test it by starting the car and removing the negative battery cable. If the car continues to run without the battery connected it means that your alternator is producing power. You can test how much voltage your alternator is producing by using a multimeter. Set your multimeter to Volts (at least 20) and then touch the disconnected negative cable to one of the multimeter leads while touching the other battery cable with the other multimeter lead. It should read around 13-14.5 Volts.\n\nWhat Does an Alternator Replacement Cost?\n\nIf you do the work yourself, you can save a bunch of money. Even if you purchase all the parts and tools that are required for this repair, it will still cost less than going to a mechanic.\u00a0 The other factor is the one to three hours of labor costs, at $100-$200 per hour, for a total cost to replace an alternator will probably be between $600 and $1,000 or more, depending on the cost of replacement parts.\n\nThis you alternator is going bad? Don\u2019t forget that you can head to your local AutoZone and get your alternator tested for free.",

        "title": "How to Disconnect a Car Battery",
        "content": "Why Would You Need to Disconnect a Battery?\n\nContrary to popular belief, the battery does not supply your car\u2019s electronics with their main source of energy while the engine is running \u2013 that\u2019s the alternator\u2019s job. But when there\u2019s a problem with power delivery, it\u2019s nearly always the battery that needs to be checked first. It has a lifespan of around three to five years before it can\u2019t hold up to the demand required of it, and it needs to be replaced.\nTo replace the battery requires taking the old one out. Naturally, that means disconnecting it first. But that\u2019s not the only reason you might need to do so.\nWhen the engine is off, most people would think that the electrical draws stop too. Not completely true. The electrical demand is substantially less, but take a look around in your car. See the clock on the radio and the dome lights on? They represent a tiny draw on the system. As well, the body control module, powertrain control module, and other computers inside the car need to maintain memory, so a teeny electrical draw keeps them powered up too, even if they\u2019re \u201casleep\u201d.\nIn other cases, the battery needs to be disconnected before repairs commence. For example, an extremely off-chance scenario can occur when repairing the airbag system that an airbag could deploy if the module still has power. As well, fixing something in the engine compartment might seem safe with the engine off, but some cars can still trigger the cooling fan when the key isn\u2019t even in the ignition. It poses a risk to health working on some things with the battery connected.\nWhether you\u2019re fixing a problem, storing your car, or replacing the battery, here are the steps to take to disconnect it.\n\nDisconnecting the Battery for Replacement\n\nImagine that you\u2019ve needed to jump-start your car three times this week. Despite charging the battery between, it doesn\u2019t have the gusto to start on its own. You need to replace the battery. It\u2019s not a difficult process but it needs to be completed accurately or sparks could fly.\n\nDisconnecting the Car Battery for Replacement\n\n1. Locate the Battery\n\nIt might seem ridiculous at first to mention finding the battery, but not all car batteries are under the hood. In some vehicles like BMW models and some Chevy\u2019s, the battery is located in the trunk, tucked away under a panel. In even rarer circumstances, the battery could be under the rear seat bottom. Check these places if you don\u2019t see it under the hood.\n\n2. Remove the Negative Battery Cable\n\nAlways disconnect the negative battery cable first. The negative post is indicated with a (-) near the terminal. Use a wrench to loosen the clamp, typically a 10mm size. Other options can be 8mm, 11mm, 12mm, or 13mm. When it\u2019s loose enough, wiggle the connection off the battery and secure it away from the post.\n\n3. Remove the Positive Battery Cable\n\nNext, remove the positive cable in the same way as the negative side. There\u2019s not much more to it.\n\n4. Unfasten the Hold-Down\n\nThen to remove your battery, take the battery hold-down off. It cold be a block fastened at the battery\u2019s base that needs to be removed or a bar across the top of the battery case. You can\u2019t get the battery out without taking this off.\n\nDisconnecting a Car Battery for Storage\n\nIf you\u2019re storing your car long-term like over the winter, you\u2019ll do the exact same process as if you\u2019re replacing it. Store your battery somewhere warm, and put it on a block or shelf off the ground.\u00a0\nBut imagine that you\u2019re taking a month-long trip to Europe and your car is staying in long-term parking. Since you don\u2019t want a dead battery upon your arrival back home, you can just disconnect it. Instead of taking both cables off the battery, all you need to do is remove the negative cable. Tuck the end off to the side where it won\u2019t contact the post, and consider securing it there with a bungee cord or string.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re performing a repair on your car that requires the battery be disconnected, it\u2019s the same procedure too. When you\u2019re all done, you may have to program the radio presets, the memory seats, and the like, but your battery will be safe in the meantime.\n\nRisks of Doing It Wrong\n\nWhy is it a big deal to disconnect the battery the right way? Simply put, the consequences can be extremely expensive or hazardous to your health if you don\u2019t.\nWhen you\u2019re removing the battery cables, it\u2019s imperative that you never touch the positive and negative battery posts with a wrench, ratchet, or other conductive object at the same time. While it\u2019s only 12 volts, it can send a shower of sparks out or cause a fire. If the battery cables are still connected when that happens, it can blow fuses or relays and melt wiring and fusible links, even shorting computer modules out. There\u2019s no telling the time, aggravation, and cost to fix it.\nAnd again, working on the certain parts of your car like the airbags or seatbelt pretensioners can trigger violent reactions that can all be avoided if you simply disconnect the battery.",

        "title": "How Much Does an Alternator Replacement Cost?",
        "content": "Factors Affecting the Alternator Price\u00a0\nNew alternators might all look roughly the same, but differences between them will affect their price. They include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe year, make, model, and engine size. Only an exact match for your car\u2019s needs will do, so always shop for parts like the alternator taking its specs into consideration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe amperage. Smaller alternators that don\u2019t need to generate as much electricity for the car tend to have less high-value material content like copper used in the windings. Thus manufacturing costs are lower. It isn\u2019t always the case, though.\u00a0\u00a0\nIts mounting style. Since the alternator needs to fit perfectly, you can\u2019t choose a low-cost alternator intended for a different car. It won\u2019t work.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe types of electrical connections. Alternators for older cars that are considered 1-wire alternators often are lower priced, while 3-wire alternators tend to be more expensive.\u00a0\nThe new part\u2019s warranty. Choosing a new part with 1 year of warranty compared to a similar part with a lifetime warranty will, expectedly, cost you more money initially.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Role of the Alternator\u00a0\n\nCars today require a surprising amount of power. Not only are there obvious systems that need power like the radio, power windows, door locks, sunroof, and heated seats but there are modules and sensors all around as well. As an example, the anti-lock brakes usually have a wheel speed sensor at every wheel, an anti-lock brake control module, an ABS pump, and other related parts that all need constant access to power.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe alternator takes power from the battery and amplifies as an electromagnet to provide enough electricity to maintain operations for all your car\u2019s electrical needs while the engine is running. It also generates enough power to deliver some back to the battery, topping up its charge. The alternator\u2019s magnetic rotor and copper windings create an alternating current (AC), then a set of diodes in the rectifier convert it to direct current (DC), the type of electricity your car\u2019s devices need in order to operate. The voltage output is regulated to prevent damage from overcharging as well as issues with too little power.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the alternator isn\u2019t producing between 13.5 and 14.5 volts, creating noises, or if the wrong type of current is finding its way through the alternator is failing, and it needs to be replaced.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSigns You May Need a New Alternator\u00a0\nRepair costs are often unavoidable. Once symptoms of a bad alternator are present, it becomes a question of whether you can avoid extra costs from related repairs. If you have one or more of these symptoms, it might be time to change the alternator.\u00a0\n\nDead Battery: The battery sends a massive electrical current to the starter when you crank the engine over. If you have a dead battery, it can be a warning sign that the alternator isn\u2019t replenishing the power drawn by the starter.\u00a0\n\nIlluminated Battery Light: but it warns of a charging problem. It could be undercharging or undercharging, two conditions that can be caused by a fault alternator, among other things.\u00a0\n\nBurning Smells: A pungent burning rubber smell may be a belt slipping along the alternator pulley if it\u2019s beginning to seize, and a burning electrical smell could be a fault inside the alternator.\u00a0\n\nLighting Issues: You might notice your interior and exterior lights are dimmer than normal or are abnormally bright. There could be flickering as well. This can be from inconsistent voltage from the alternator.\u00a0\n\nUnusual Electrical Issues: Odd happenings in your car may not seem related to the alternator, but it\u2019s always a possibility. Low voltage can cause slow power window motors, crackling or fading out from the radio, low fan speed, and a host of other electrical problems.\u00a0\nAvailability of cores to rebuild. Alternators are either remanufactured or new, and the majority of the aftermarket is remanufactured. Rarer vehicles and options produce rarer alternators, which means there\u2019s less cores coming back to rebuild, which means higher costs.\u00a0\n\nWhirring Under the Hood: All else might be working fine, but a whirring or whining noise under the hood can spell disaster for the alternator soon. Worn or corroded alternator bearings can mean a seize-up is impending.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCan I Drive With An Alternator Problem?\u00a0\nMost of the time, a short drive is fine when the alternator isn\u2019t charging enough. The battery\u2019s reserve power can substitute electricity, such as if you\u2019re driving a few blocks to the repair shop. However, if your alternator is overcharging, it could damage computer modules, the battery, and other electronics or wiring even during a short drive.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you detect an alternator problem, it should be a top priority to have it fixed. If you\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s safe to drive, play it safe and arrange a tow truck to get it to your destination.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow Often Does an Alternator Need to Be Replaced?\u00a0\n\nUnlike your brake pads, tires, or even the serpentine belt, it\u2019s tough to gauge how long an alternator will last. For some cars, it will last for the car\u2019s lifetime while for others, it will require replacement more than once during its course of action.",

        "title": "How Long Does an Alternator Last?\u00a0",
        "content": "How is an Alternator Made?\u00a0\nRegardless of which car make and model you drive, an alternator\u2019s general design has remained the same for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\nAn external case is made of aluminum to contain all the critical workings, and the choice of material is intentional. Aluminum does not magnetize so it won\u2019t interfere with the alternator\u2019s function.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe alternator pulley is mounted on the front of the assembly. Cars with a V-belt for the alternator will have a single deep groove in the pulley while cars that use a serpentine belt have a flatter surface with multiple shallower grooves.\u00a0\nThe stator is a bundle of copper wires fashioned into three windings and fixed to the inner surface of the case or shell. It delivers the generated power to the battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe rotor is the magnetized rotating mass attached to the pulley by a shaft. It\u2019s connected to power, creating an electromagnet that generates the alternating current electrical field in conjunction with the stator.\u00a0\nThe rectifier converts power from an alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) that your car\u2019s devices need.\u00a0\nA voltage regulator controls how much power can pass from the windings to the conductor to power your car. On older vehicles before 1980, many voltage regulators were external, mounted somewhere in the engine compartment. Since then, they have been internally located within the alternator.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther parts such as bearings, wiring, brackets, and brushes ensure the alternator continues to function reliably for years.\u00a0\nWhy an Alternator Can Fail\u00a0\nDesigned for longevity and dependability, an alternator can seem indestructible. For some cars, the alternator can and does last its complete lifetime but that isn\u2019t always the case. Inside, there are parts that can wear down or there can be sudden failures. It might generate less electric energy than it\u2019s supposed to, it can be sporadic, or it can be completely out of commission with zero output.\u00a0\n\nWorn brushes reduce the alternator\u2019s conductivity and can be the source of many alternator problems.\u00a0\u00a0\nExcessive energy demands from the battery and electrical system can make the alternator charge at maximum capacity, shortening its lifespan.\u00a0\u00a0\nDecreased output from failed or corroded sections of the rotor can mean the alternator doesn\u2019t function well enough, requiring a repair.\u00a0\u00a0\nA regulator issue can mean an overproduction or underproduction of electrical energy.\u00a0\u00a0\nCorroded or broken electrical connections inside the alternator can interrupt current flow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSometimes, a failure doesn\u2019t mean that the alternator isn\u2019t charging. It\u2019s possible that bearings can fail from an overtightened belt or due to wear, which starts as an annoying noise, but can lead to mis-alignment of moving parts, and catastrophic failure.\u00a0\u00a0\nSymptoms of a Bad Alternator\u00a0\nWhen an alternator goes bad, symptoms are sure to appear. They can vary depending on the cause of failure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA battery light on isn\u2019t actually related to a battery problem. Rather, it\u2019s indicating a charging system fault when the voltage is above or below the normal operating range. It comes on when the alternator output is above 15 volts or below 12 volts.\u00a0\nDim headlights and interior lights are a common symptom since they\u2019re receiving less than the normal 12 volts of power.\u00a0\nWhining under the hood can occur when the alternator is struggling to keep up with the car\u2019s demand for power.\u00a0\nA burning smell is another common occurrence when the belt is slipping on the alternator pulley and when there are overheating electrical connections in the alternator.\u00a0\nThe engine can stall while you drive when your car\u2019s critical systems don\u2019t have the required voltage to maintain their operations.\u00a0\u00a0\nA dead battery may be directly related to an alternator that\u2019s unable to produce power, thus it doesn\u2019t charge the battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany of the symptoms of a bad alternator can be caused by other issues too, so an accurate diagnosis is important to prevent spending money on repairs unnecessarily.\u00a0\nHow Do You Change an Alternator?\u00a0\n\nThe alternator is driven by a belt from the front of the engine, so it\u2019s almost always located in an accessible location. Some cars have other components in the way that must be removed or relocated to access the alternator but, in many cases, the job can be done in around an hour or so.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the exact process to replace an alternator varies by model, begin by disconnecting the negative cable from the battery for safety. Then, remove the serpentine or alternator belt. Disconnect the wiring from the alternator itself being careful not to damage any plastic connectors, then remove the fasteners that hold the alternator to the engine. Install the new alternator, making sure you\u2019ve chosen an exact replacement based on the car\u2019s year, make, model, and engine size. After connecting the battery cable, start the car and test that your alternator is working properly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso, if changing an alternator isn\u2019t a job you want to tackle, check out our list of Preferred Shops in your area to help you complete the job.\u00a0\u00a0\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Bad Battery vs. Bad Alternator: Which One Is the Problem?",
        "content": "What is your car battery responsible for?\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s battery has one primary responsibility: to provide enough energy to start the car. Aside from this, it will also provide backup power to your vehicle accessories for instances when your alternator is not running at full spin because the engine RPMs are too low. This may happen frequently in city driving, especially in stop and go traffic, or a traffic jam where you\u2019re stuck in one spot for a while. It also provides all the power to any accessories that need to be on while the car is not running, like a security system or dashcam.\u00a0\nStarting a car takes anywhere from 400 to 600 amps normally, and can range up to 2,000 amps, depending on the size of the engine. Smaller car engines will be on the lower side of that scale, whereas large commercial vehicles may have a big diesel powerplant that requires the upper end of the scale. Because of the incredible strain put on automotive batteries to start the car, their design is optimized to discharge a lot of current in the starting phase and then recharge immediately. If a battery is started repeatedly without fully recharging, it can start to lose its ability to retain a full charge and you may begin to see battery issues.\u00a0\n\nWhat symptoms indicate a battery problem?\n\nThe battery\u2019s main function is to start the vehicle, so the most obvious symptom of a bad battery will be failure to start the car. If you turn the key or press the start button and nothing happens, it\u2019s a good bet that your battery is completely depleted. If you get a clicking sound but the engine doesn\u2019t turn over, it\u2019s often a sign that the battery is just about dead. Another sign of a bad battery is very slow cranking when you\u2019re turning over the engine to start the car. Very slow cranking also happens in northern locations where the super-low temperatures cause the engine components to be stiff and the battery voltage to drop. A block heater or oil pan heater can help to mitigate that problem.\u00a0\n\nWhat is your alternator responsible for?\u00a0\n\nYour alternator is a small generator that produces the electricity your car needs to run all the accessories and recharge your battery at the same time. The output voltage of an alternator will be between 13 and 14.5 volts and the amperage output can vary, depending on the vehicle. Most passenger vehicle alternators have a maximum amperage between 130 and 200 amps, but you can get alternators that are rated up to 400 amps, depending on the application. If you install a high-power stereo system with massive subwoofers you may want to upgrade your alternator because those subs will pull a lot of amps and reduce the amount going to recharge your battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlternators aren\u2019t always running at maximum output, either. When your car is idling, like in heavy traffic or at a stoplight, the engine RPMs are too low to maximize alternator output, so it will focus on providing power to the engine ignition and the essential accessories like cooling fans, water pumps, and HVAC. Your battery won\u2019t be receiving a full recharge in that scenario.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat symptoms indicate an alternator problem?\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned that your alternator is beginning to fail, there are some early warnings to look out for. One potential warning of a bad alternator is if your headlights or interior lights are running dim or are dimming and then getting brighter, depending on how fast you are driving. This indicates that the alternator is providing inconsistent voltage. If other electrical accessories in the car are starting to do weird things, like shutting off unexpectedly or operating poorly, that\u2019s another sign that you need to check the alternator.\u00a0\nIf your car won\u2019t start because of a dead battery, try to jump start it. If it starts but dies again after a short time, that may be a sign that your alternator isn\u2019t functioning properly because your alternator provides the power to the engine ignition.\u00a0\n\nHow to tell if it\u2019s your battery or the alternator that is causing the problem\n\nYou can test your alternator by starting your car and using a multi-meter across the battery terminals to measure voltage If the voltage is between 13 and 14.5 volts, then your alternator is charging the battery. Further tests can determine if the alternator is supplying the correct amperage under load, which can also be done at any AutoZone location. If the voltage is below 13 volts or if it is fluctuating wildly, the alternator is likely suspect and will need to be removed and bench tested. This can also be performed at any AutoZone to determine if the fault is in the alternator, or the wiring circuit between the alternator and battery. \u202f\u00a0\n\nHow can I prevent problems with my battery or alternator?\u00a0\n\nIf your driving habits include infrequent short trips and many days of not driving, you may deplete your battery and damage its ability to recharge. You can either make a point of taking the car for a longer drive on the highway once a week, or you can install a trickle charger to keep the battery topped up. It\u2019s also a good idea to clean your battery terminals and connections with a wire brush periodically and apply some dielectric grease to the contact points. Dielectric grease helps to improve the electrical connection and also protects the surface from corrosion.\nWhether you\u2019ve settled on the car battery being at fault or the alternator needing to be replaced, or if you simply need tools to accurately diagnose the concern, AutoZone can help. Ask an AutoZoner for Trusted Advice or choose the parts and tools you need online for quick delivery or pickup.

        "title": "What Does the Battery Light Mean?",
        "content": "Why is the battery light on in my car?\n\nFirst things first: if the battery light comes on in your car when you turn it on, you probably have nothing to worry about. Sometimes the battery light will come on when you start your car, but then the light will quickly flick off. If this is the case, pay it no mind.\nSecond, the battery light is probably one of the most misunderstood lights in your vehicle because most people immediately assume it means your battery is bad. While your battery can be bad in some of these cases \u2013 that is not why the light is on. The light is on because your alternator is not properly charging. Initially, in the olden days, this light was referred to as the generator light and often had the abbreviation \u201cGEN\u201d on the light itself. Several made the migration to \u201cALT\u201d but eventually, this light became a little battery icon, or battery word, and the rest is misunderstood history.\nWhat you need to know though is that the battery light does not mean your battery is bad. It does mean, if you don\u2019t attend to it quickly, your battery will die, because your entire car\u2019s electrical system is running off of it.\n\nCan You Drive Your Car With the Battery Light On?\n\nThe short answer to this is, \u201cYes.\u201d The full answer is, \u201cProbably not for too long.\u201d The car\u2019s battery light coming on generally means that there is something preventing your car\u2019s electric system from the battery charged and thus, the car is running on battery power only. Basically, if you see the battery light on in your car when it is running, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be able to drive it for very long. Think of it like unplugging your cell phone from your wall charger. If you leave it plugged in, your phone will last indefinitely on 100% charge. Unplug it, and you\u2019re on battery power. Chances are good that after a day, your phone will be dead.\nThe exact amount of time that your car will be able to function with the battery light on depends on many factors, but assuming that the alternator is the issue (this is the most common issue) it is likely that your car will lose battery power after 30 minutes to an hour of driving. This is about how long it takes most car batteries to completely discharge to a level that the ignition system cannot keep the car running. Of course, this depends on your battery and your car, and some cars may be able to last longer while others may die quicker.\nOther signs of problems with your car\u2019s electrical system may be windows that will not roll up or down if your car has power windows, or a radio that will not turn on. You may also experience problems with the headlights or climate control.\n\nWhat Can I Do if The Battery Light is On?\n\nThe smartest thing to do is to try and get your car home or to a mechanic\u2019s garage as quickly as possible if you see the battery light go on. If you are not in a position where you can do this, the first thing is to ensure that you keep the engine running. Do not turn it off for any reason. If you turn off the engine, it\u2019s likely that you will not be able to start the car again without a jump, and if you\u2019re in an area where you don\u2019t have easy access to mechanics, you probably won\u2019t have easy access to a jump, either.\nYou will also want to make sure that you turn off any features of the car that draw on electricity unnecessarily. This means turning off the air conditioning, stereo, potentially dimming the dome lights, and try not to roll your windows up or down if your car has power windows. If you have any external devices plugged into your car, like cell phones, make sure that they are unplugged. If it is dark, make sure to keep your headlights on for as long as possible, as driving with them off is dangerous.\nUnderstand that driving with the light on can cause issues with your battery in the long run, most notably the rapid discharging can cause your battery to also go bad, and not be able to be recharged. Many customers end up replacing the alternator in the car, don\u2019t properly recharge the battery before installation, then find out the battery also went bad. Just remember that driving on the battery light is limited time. Get the alternator or wiring fixed, and properly recharge the battery at the same time.",

        "title": "Dead Car Battery? Learn the Signs of a Bad Battery",
        "content": "Signs of a Dead Car Battery\n\n1. A Sudden, Slower Start\n\nWhen temps drop below 20 degrees, generally any car\u2019s starting cadence will slow down. Get below 0 and it gets even slower. If you notice this behavior suddenly and the temperature hasn\u2019t dropped \u2013 a slow, dragging start suddenly begin, get your battery tested as soon as possible and don\u2019t ignore it. Eventually, the car will not start. \nIf a slow starting battery seems to be able to take a charge and test fine, it\u2019s likely that a parasitic drain, or draw is discharging the battery while the vehicle sits, and the electrical system will need to be looked at.\n\n2. Headlights and Power, But No Start\n\nYour lights work, the radio works, but you get a click or buzz once you hit the key. Or, your headlights are very dim. The purpose of the battery is to crank the engine by providing a full dose of high-amperage power to the starter. When the battery is low, it cannot deliver that power but often can still supply enough power for lights or accessories, that don\u2019t require as much amperage. \nKeep in mind, jump-starting the car in these situations should only be done in an emergency. Get the battery tested as soon as possible, and do not rely on the alternator to charge the battery back up!\n\n3. No Radio\n\nYour radio doesn\u2019t turn on. Don\u2019t mistake it for a minor inconvenience. When the ignition is in the ON position, the battery will run the radio, windshield wipers, and headlights, among other electronic devices. If these flicker or dim before starting, your battery charge is weak.\n\n4. Swollen Battery Size\n\nThe battery is fat, or swollen. The manufacturer designs your battery to have a specific footprint, and if the battery swells in size, you should be able to see it. If you have a bloated battery, the alternator has a faulty voltage regulator and has over charged the battery.  This over charging of the battery is caused by a buildup of hydrogen gases faster than the battery can dissipate.  Damage to the battery has already been done and cannot be reversed.\n\n5. Odd Smell From Your Battery\n\n6. Your Battery is Old\n\nYour battery is old. The average life span of a car battery is typically between four to six years. At around the four-year mark, you should pay more attention to it. Have a technician check to see how much charge it has.  AutoZone provides this service for free.\n\n7. Check Engine Light Flashes\n\nThe check engine light flashes or stays on constantly. Generally, this light identifies serious problems in your engine that will require costly maintenance. But you may get lucky and discover that it\u2019s only your car battery that needs replacement. Visit your local AutoZone store for a free diagnosis.\n\n8. Vehicle Starts, Then Dies Immediately\n\nThis is a very strange issue that can indeed happen on certain makes / models of vehicles. The battery will have enough voltage to start the vehicle, but then it immediately dies and will not idle. If you encounter this issue, there are a multitude of things that could be wrong, but doing a simple battery check is the first and easiest place to start. The basis behind this is when a battery fails, it can cause interruptions to the constant signals it sends to the ECU. Then if the battery can muster enough might to start the car, the sensors controlling engine idle, speed, and fueling have already lost signal, and the car immediately dies.\n\nBattery Testing & Charging at AutoZone\nIf you\u2019re experiencing signs of a dead car battery, it\u2019s time to visit your local AutoZone. Bring your battery in today and get it tested to help diagnose the problem. If you need a new battery, we will help you find a replacement that fits your needs.

        "title": "Do Lithium Ion Battery Boosters work?",
        "content": "How Do Lithium Ion Jump Starters Work?\n\nThe short answer is \u2013 science. Lithium Ion batteries are light weight, compact, and they\u00a0have the ability to\u00a0pack a serious, long lasting charge, which makes them ideal for a battery jump pack\u00a0that\u2019s small in size and very\u00a0convenient. \nOne such unit is the\u00a0Duralast\u00a0DL-800L, which packs 800 cranking amps into its small size, and a very ideal price-point at just over $100.00. The unit comes with the charging\u00a0unit, which is encased in rubber for durability, has an illuminated\u00a0LED screen that shows your charge percent, an attachable set of clamps, and carrying bag\u00a0\u2013\u00a0which makes it very easy to stow away in a glove box, console, or inside the garage or home. \nUsing the DL-800L is simple. Once charged, simply plug in the cable assembly and turn the unit on\u00a0with a switch on the side.\u00a0The cables provide protection against reverse polarity, short circuit, and reverse charging. Once hooked up, you will then quickly see the blue LED screen illuminate and show you the available charge. Hook your clamps up properly to the battery or charging posts, the unit will auto-sense\u00a0it\u2019s hooked up, and will now be available to offer a boost. Crank your car as normal and disconnect the unit once the car is started. It\u2019s that easy.\n\nTesting the DL-800L\n\nThe positive cable of the C10 was disconnected, rendering the DL-800L as the only source of battery power for starting the vehicle.\u00a0\nTo test the DL-800L on our own, we wanted to run the booster through\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0paces in a worst-case environment. We used an old, but trusty 1985 Chevy C10 \u201csquarebody\u201d classic that had been through more than its\u00a0share\u00a0of miles and replacement parts over the years. To take it one step worse, we completely disconnected the positive lead of the battery (which had been converted to top post battery by its previous owner, for those closely paying attention!) in an attempt to see whether the DL-800L could start the truck on\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0own, with no additional battery help \u2013 and do it several times. \nOnce hooked up, to\u00a0our\u00a0amazement, the truck fired up with the first bump of the key better and faster than the old, tired battery had done.\u00a0We\u00a0then\u00a0tried it a second time. A third time. A fourth. A fifth. All the way up to 6 times. Each time, a quick bump of the key and the truck was started. A quick look at the battery charge after 6 times? 98%.\u00a0To say that the Dl-800L is solid battery insurance is an understatement. \nThe unit can be used around the home and garage for starting stubborn lawn equipment or powersports toys. It\u2019s perfect for stowing it in the boat for emergency start-up if you\u2019re out on the lake, or for extra insurance on camping and overland trips far away from home when you accidentally leave your stereo on in the truck all evening (been there, done that). The DL800L is perfect for stashing in the car as an emergency pack during\u00a0winter, and\u00a0saving yourself from very bad dead battery situations.\n\nFind an Auto Parts Store Near You",

        "content": "How to Remove a Car Battery\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPark the vehicle on a dry, flat surface and set the parking brake. The ignition should be off, and if the vehicle is warm, give it time to cool before starting this job. Wear safety goggles, gloves, and pull back long hair. You should never smoke under the hood, especially when working on batteries.\n\n2. Disconnect Negative and Positive Cables\n\nStart with the negative terminal and disconnect the negative battery cable. Look for a black cable and a minus (-) symbol.\nTop-Post: You may need to use a ratchet to loosen and remove the clamp. Once the clamp is off, move it safely out of the way.\nSide-Post: There will be an 8mm fastener. Use an 8mm ratchet to loosen, and then move it safely out of the way.\nDisconnect the positive terminal after the negative terminal. Positive terminal has a plus sign (+) and the cable connected to it is usually red. It is very important that your ratchet or wrench not come in contact with anything that could be a ground, because this will cause sparks around the battery.\n\n3. Remove Battery and Restraint\n\nMost cars feature a bar or a restraint of some sort to hold the battery in place. This is often secured with a bolt or some other fastener. Remove the restraint in order to remove the battery. Pull the battery out from under the hood and set it off to the side.\n\n4. Clean Your Cables and Terminals\n\nTake a wire brush and scrub the battery cable ends as well as the battery terminals to remove any corrosion or dirt. Wear a mask to avoid breathing dust during this step.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve removed your car battery, it\u2019s time to install the replacement. Apply terminal grease before attaching the positive cable first, and then connecting the negative cable. The exact installation method will vary depending on whether you are installing a top-post or side-post battery.

        "title": "Car Battery Corrosion: How to Clean a Corroded Car Battery",
        "content": "What Causes Car Battery Corrosion?\n\nBattery corrosion around the posts of the battery is caused by the sulfuric acid and hydrogen gas vapor that can escape from the battery. Sometimes this vapor is vented out of the top vent blocks on the battery, but other times, small amounts of this vapor leak out in the area between the posts and where they seal to the plastic battery casing. This vapor mixes with other gas under the hood, the heat of the engine, the differences in lead composition between the posts and the terminals, the copper of the battery wires, and creates corrosion. Under the hood of a car, temperatures can exceed 250 degrees, and this heat causes the metal of the posts and the plastic of the casing of the battery to expand at different rates. This is the reason why you rarely see corrosion on the posts of a battery that\u2019s under a seat, or in the trunk of a car. These batteries aren\u2019t exposed to the extreme temperatures you find under the hood.\nCleaning corrosion off of your car battery terminals is not a complicated process. You don\u2019t have to take the car to a mechanic or rely on any advanced, complicated techniques to get your\u202fbattery\u202flooking like new. You can either use one of our battery cleaning solutions or a combination of baking soda and water.\u00a0It\u2019s recommended that you use either a battery cleaner brush tool, or a very small wire brush to do the cleaning, along with a solution.\n\nHOW TO CLEAN CAR BATTERY CORROSION\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nFirst, check the area around the battery for any leaking acid. If you have a battery that is leaking acid and is wet in the tray or around the bolts, this is potentially a sign of a bigger issue and not just regular battery corrosion. The battery should be removed, inspected, and tested, and the battery tray/area should be cleaned with baking soda and degreaser.\nWith a mix of some baking soda and water, you can usually neutralize and remove all the corrosion on the terminals. To do this, start by assembling the essential tools and products for the job. You\u2019ll want some protective gloves for safety reasons. Next, grab a box of baking soda from your kitchen pantry along with some water. Your battery brush, wire brush, or even an old stiff-bristled toothbrush will be a handy tool to scrub the terminals. You should also get some old rags so you don\u2019t mind getting dirty.\nRemember, if you unhook the battery terminals, your cars electronics will lose their memory power, and some vehicles need a battery tender hooked up at all times to keep 12V of power to the engine\u2019s computer. Check to make sure your car isn\u2019t one of these, and if not, unhook the battery terminals by loosening the bolts on the clamps so that the posts and the terminals can be properly cleaned. When loosening heavily corroded terminals \u2013 if you encounter ANY resistance and the bolt is too tight \u2013 stop. Mix up some solution, and don\u2019t risk breaking the terminal.\n\n2. MIX THE SOLUTION\n\nThe baking soda and water should be enough to do the job efficiently. Start with 1 tablespoon of baking soda to 1 cup of water and mix it thoroughly until all the baking soda is blended in. If there\u2019s heavy corrosion on battery terminals, it may be better to use a specialized battery terminal\u202fcleaner. These are often aerosolized for easy application.\n\n3. SCRUB\n\nScrub all the corrosion off the terminal and spray the terminal\u2019s bolt with a little penetrating oil like WD40. Next, attempt to loosen the bolt and remove the terminal for further cleaning.\n\nHow to Protect Your Car Battery from Corrosion\n\nOne of the easiest and best solutions to help protect against corrosion is by using felt battery washers and a protective grease. Battery washers are chemically treated to help absorb that vapor at the source right at the base of the post before it gets to the terminal. Battery grease is a silicone-based grease. Unlike petroleum jelly which is, like its name says, petroleum based, silicone grease will last longer when exposed to under-hood heat. Coat the top of the washer and the terminal in protective grease before installation, and that\u2019s it. Over a long period of time, these washers lose their ability to absorb that vapor. They don\u2019t last forever, but they help keep the terminals clean for several years. It\u2019s usually long enough to get you through to your next battery replacement. \nOn a side post battery, the post is actually BELOW the acid level, so a felt washer, even though it could be used, is not going to provide the level of protection as it does on a top post battery. This is where buying terminal grease will help protect. When a side post battery is subjected to heat and has the same separation between the battery and the post, it can actually leak acid. This corrodes the terminal, sometimes so badly that the bolt seizes in the bolt hole. By applying terminal protectant into the bolt hole and on the terminal, you are creating a barrier that works like an anti-seize.\nBattery terminal grease also provides great protection for non-automotive batteries. Marine applications, ATV, lawn and other small engines that operate on a battery are subjected many times to extreme heat. These batteries don\u2019t offer the ability to use a washer on them, but do allow you to coat the terminal lugs, or bolts, with protectant.\nWhen it comes to your vehicle, few things are more frustrating than dealing with battery trouble. If you follow these steps of how to clean car battery corrosion, you are much less likely to experience these issues by taking care of corrosion when it appears.\nIf you need Trustworthy Advice or clarification on how to clean car battery corrosion or you\u2019re trying to figure out the right product to work for your needs, AutoZone associates are there to help.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Battery Boosters and Chargers Guide",
        "content": "Battery Chargers vs. Maintainers vs. Jump Starters\n\n1. Battery Chargers\n\nWhen shopping for a battery charger, it\u2019s important to understand several of the other functions that chargers can provide. Most chargers on the market provide 3 charging functions \u2013 a low amp, or trickle charge (which is generally 1 to 2 amps), a standard charge (generally 6 to 10 amps), and an engine starter, which is essentially a boost of 75 to 100 amps. Several other chargers also have a feature of a \u201cmaintain charge\u201d. Let\u2019s go through what each of these various charging cycles actually mean.\nLow Amp/Trickle Charge: A trickle charge often is the most effective way of charging a battery. It\u2019s very slow, steady, and often takes 1-2 days to properly charge the battery. It does so by providing a very low amperage. Trickle charging is what is also used in Battery Maintainers, which we will talk about their use and importance later.\nStandard Charge: A standard charge allows you to charge a battery \u2013 in most cases \u2013 in 3-5 hours, sometimes sooner. Every battery, based on it\u2019s use and age, responds differently to charging, but most people use a standard charge because they need use out of the battery as soon as possible.\nBoost or Engine Starting: The Engine Starting Feature of a battery charger is designed to supply a strong current of 75-100 amps to help start a vehicle if the battery is charged enough to turn the engine over, but not enough to turn it with the speed needed to start the engine. This supplied boost generally only lasts 30-60 seconds before the charger shuts off the current. It\u2019s important to note that this feature is different than that of a separate Battery Booster (discussed below), which supplies a much higher amperage boost and can start a car with a completely dead battery.\n\n2. Battery Maintainers\n\nOne of the big killers of batteries is a series of constant discharges / recharges. A battery can only take so many of these before it simply loses its ability to take and maintain a charge. Many times, items that suffer from this are lawn and power sports equipment, or vehicles that are rarely driven or stored for the winter \u2013 anything that goes a long time in between use. Because of this, battery maintainers are a fantastic item to solve this problem.\nA battery maintainer is essentially a very small version of a battery charger that serves one purpose \u2013 supply a very low-amperage trickle charge to the battery only when it needs it, and in that sense, keep it \u201cmaintained\u201d at the proper voltage at all times. Maintainers are generally the size of the palm of your hand, and provide 2 types of ways to connect to a battery. You can use standard \u201calligator\u201d clamps like all chargers use, or you can go with a permanent solution that allows you to wire a pigtail connector right into your battery cables. This way, when you want to hook the maintainer up, you simply plug the connector in, plug the maintainer in to the wall, and you are ready to go.\nMaintainers are growing in popularity as customers realize that replacing a $100.00 battery every year, or 2 years on multiple pieces of equipment is far worse than buying a $30-50.00 maintainer to keep all your batteries in top shape when not being used. Many maintainers have multiple circuits, so you can maintain multiple batteries at once (think of boats that may contain 2-3 batteries), or, buy a maintainer for every piece of equipment you have that uses a battery. One such maintainer is the Duralast DL-2D.\nKeep in mind, that many Battery Chargers also have a \u201cmaintainer\u201d function, as discussed before. This means that when the battery is kept hooked up to the charger, the charger will sense if the battery drops below the ideal threshold of a charge, and will then subsequently charge the battery. While this is a great feature to have, it only works for one battery, whereas the smaller, cheaper maintainers can be purchased for multiple batteries. More recent technology has seen Solar Maintainers come on the market, which is also a great solution if getting power to the location of the batteries is an issue. A solar maintainer can be kept on a car parked in a driveway, or equipment inside a shed with no power, as long as the solar panel can be placed outside in the sun.\n\n3. Battery Boosters\n\nBattery Boosters, or Booster-packs are essentially a portable car battery. They provide high amperage (800-1200 amps) power through connector clamps, and can start a vehicle with or without a battery. Most standard jump packs are about a cubic foot in size, have a carry handle, and many can be rather heavy as they are housing a heavy duty battery. An example of this is the Duralast DL-1200AC, which is a Jump-starter and an emergency air compressor all in one. These boosters are a great addition to any garage or shop, making it much easier than the, \u201choney, can you pull the car around to the truck and get the jumper cables!\u201d approach to starting something with a dead battery.\nOver the past few years, Lithium Ion Boosters have risen rapidly in popularity. They are small in size, lightweight, and provide a ton of starting power, while at the same time, providing this in a small package that can easily be stowed in a Car, Truck, or Boat for emergency use. We run one of these Lithium Ion boosters, the Duralast DL-800L through the paces to show just how powerful it really is.\nIt\u2019s important to note that starting a vehicle with a very-dead battery is not a best-practice and should be left to emergencies only. A modern-day alternator is not designed to completely charge a dead battery that could not start a car \u2013 it\u2019s designed to provide power to a car that is already started, and maintain the battery\u2019s constant charge, which is much easier than charging a battery that\u2019s dead. It will, and can, but can be super taxing to an alternator, and many times, lead to failure. This is why many times, customers who come in for a battery replacement who have repeatedly jump-started the car over weeks and weeks suddenly find that their alternator is now not working either. When ever possible, always charge a battery properly first \u2013 if you have time.",

        "title": "Are Car Batteries Universal?",
        "content": "Are All Car Batteries\u00a0the Same?\n\nNo. Car batteries differ in multiple ways to work with different vehicle\u2019s specifications, and they are generally year, make, model-specific.\nMany car batteries do have one important similarity in\u00a0how they work. The vast majority of batteries that you would use in an automobile are called starting, lighting, and ignition batteries, commonly abbreviated to SLI. This battery starts your car, and it also provides the power necessary to run the radio, lights, and other electrical components in your car. These batteries tend to have a shallow charge cycle, and provide power in short bursts.\nIt is also true that the majority of car batteries offer a standard 12v voltage output.\nAgain, the majority of automotive batteries are SLI batteries, but not all of them are. If you happen to drive a hybrid vehicle or an electric car, you may have a lithium-ion battery. Lithium-ion batteries have much more energy compared to an SLI battery, and are much lighter. However, they don\u2019t last as long as SLI batteries do. Most SLI batteries last for four to five years, while most lithium-ion batteries as an estimated lifespan of around three years.\nHowever, even if you know that your car needs an SLI battery to function, it\u2019s not the same thing as driving down the street to the big-box store and picking up AAA batteries. Sure, most of the batteries may supply 12v voltage; however, that doesn\u2019t mean a\u00a0big pickup truck\u00a0is going to be able to use the same battery as a small, zippy coupe.\nSo if you\u2019ve ever asked yourself, \u201cAre car batteries universal?\u201d the answer is \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWhy Is Choosing the Right Kind of Car Battery\u00a0Important?\n\nChoosing the right battery\nWell, the first issue you may encounter if you try to purchase a battery that is not suited for your car is that the battery itself may not fit into the\u00a0battery tray. Clearly, if you can\u2019t even get the battery to stay in the car, it\u2019s not going to do you or the car much good.\nPlus, particularly with modern cars, there are a ton of electronic components that go into the functioning of the vehicle. Many vehicles come with entire computer systems built into the car that not only help with GPS and radio functioning, but also control safety features and can sense for oddities with your vehicle like low tire pressure. If your car beeps at you if you are about to back into something or lets you know that you need an\u00a0oil change, all of that is run electronically. This means that it\u2019s being charged by the battery.\nGiven how important electrical systems are to modern cars, it\u2019s important to protect those systems. Using an inappropriate battery can put all of this at risk and lead to very expensive repairs.\nHaving the appropriate battery also ensures that the battery\u2019s lifespan is maximized. While it could be theoretically possible to use an inappropriate battery for your car, this is a risk both for the car and the battery.\n\nWhat Battery Should I Choose for\u00a0My Car?\n\nWhich Battery Is Right For You\nYou need to consult your owner\u2019s manual to really get the specs you need to purchase a new battery.\n\nParticularly if you are not heavily knowledgeable regarding the electrical system of your car, this is an area where it\u2019s not a good idea to go rogue. The best thing to do is to purchase\u00a0the right battery, the one that is recommended by your manufacturer and fits OEM specs for your specific vehicle and the engine inside of it.\nIf you are looking to go custom, basically, look somewhere else on your car to do it. For your\u00a0battery replacement, it\u2019s safest to play by the book.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Lead Acid vs. Lithium-Ion Jump Starters",
        "content": "Understanding the Technology: How Lead Acid and Lithium-Ion Batteries Work\n\nThe battery chemistries used for jump starters are quite different. For a 12-volt lead-acid battery, there are six cells that each store just over two volts each. When it\u2019s fully charged, it contains 12.6 volts. Ions travel through a liquid or gel electrolyte between a negatively-charged lead electrode and a positively-charged lead dioxide electrode. This movement of ions translates into the electricity your vehicle uses to power its electronics, and when the alternator or battery charger is working, it reverses the ion flow back to the negative plate.\nWhile a lithium-ion battery also moves ions from the negative electrode to the positive, the chemistry is different. Cells in Li-ion battery production can be virtually any size you can imagine, so a 12-volt battery is often just one larger cell. The electrolyte is a dissolved lithium salt solution rather than sulfuric acid in lead acid batteries.\n\nComparing Features: Power, Weight, and Size\n\nA jump starter comparison between these two battery chemistries reveals some pretty surprising results that favor lithium-ion options:\n\nLi-ion portable jump starters contain more power for their size compared to lead acid. It has the ability to store energy at a much higher density.\nLead acid batteries are heavy since much of the battery is made up of lead plates and liquid weight. Comparatively, Li-ion batteries are much lighter \u2013 typically less than one-quarter of the weight for the same energy capacity.\nTo generate the same energy as a lead acid battery, Li-ion batteries are much smaller. Many li-ion jump starters can fit in a center console or glove box whereas lead acid jump starters would simply not be able to fit.\n\nAlthough a lead acid jump starter may be sufficient, li-ion leads the segment in terms of power, weight, and size.\n\nAdvantages and Limitations of Lead Acid Jump Starters\n\nLead-acid jump starters are typically cheaper, powerful, easily rechargeable, and can provide a high power output capability. They are also known for their reliability and durability when used correctly, and they have one of the lowest self-discharge rates among rechargeable batteries.\nHowever, lead-acid jump starters also have notable drawbacks. They are heavier and bulkier due to their low energy density, which makes them less practical. They also degrade more easily and lose charge quickly compared to lithium-ion. This means that they may require more maintenance, and their lifespan can be shorter.\n\nAdvantages and Limitations of Lithium-Ion Jump Starters\n\nIn comparison, lithium-ion jump starters are generally smaller, lighter, and more user-friendly. They have a longer cycle life, meaning they can be fully charged and discharged more times before needing to be replaced. Lithium-ion batteries can also deliver power at high currents without losing capacity.\nDespite these advantages, lithium-ion jump starters also come with their own set of challenges. They are typically more expensive than lead-acid jump starters, and they may be more sensitive to cold temperatures.\n\nChoosing the Right Jump Starter for Your Needs\n\nWhat\u2019s most important for you in a jump starter? That\u2019s what you should focus on when making your selection.\n\nDo you have a high-displacement engine? Look for higher-capacity jump starters for larger vehicles, and vice versa.\nIs size and portability important? If you plan on keeping your jump starter in your car, a li-ion option is best, but lead acid does well if it\u2019s kept in your home or garage on a charger.\nWill you use it as a battery bank? For many, you can plug in USB chargers to top up phones and other devices.\nWhat\u2019s your budget? If you\u2019re keeping it low-cost, lead acid is the way to go. But if you have a bit more to spend to get better longevity, lower weight, and smaller size, look at Li-ion options.\n\nTips for Proper Usage and Maintenance\n\nWhether you decide on li-ion or lead acid, here are some tips for safety and maintenance on your new jump starter:\n\nNever attempt to charge or jump-start a battery that is frozen or low on electrolyte. The battery may rupture or explode.\nAlways ensure you know where to attach the jumper cables. Identify the positive terminal on the dead battery correctly and connect the negative to a ground, not the battery.\nTake care to avoid incidental contact with the vehicle when your jump starter leads are connected to a live battery.\nKeep your jump starter charged. Avoid letting the unit sit discharged.\nThe best practice is to charge a jump starter after each use. Remember, jump-starter batteries have no memory issues, so frequent charges, even when they are only slightly discharged, will not harm them.\n\nEnvironmental Considerations: Disposal and Recycling\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best portable jump starters for your money, AutoZone is your trusted source.

        "title": "How to Test a Car Battery With a Multimeter",
        "content": "Testing Your Battery\n\nHow to Use a Multimeter\n\nMultimer being used to test a battery.\n\nEssentially, a multimeter is a device to test electrical circuits for a variety of industries. It can be used for measuring current, voltage, resistance, continuity, and a gamut of other things. There are analog multimeters still around, but the majority you\u2019ll see available today are digital multimeters, with a small screen that displays your readings.\u00a0\nIt has one black lead and one red lead that need to be connected or touched off to a point. You will be connecting the red lead to the positive terminal of the battery, and the black lead to the negative or ground terminal of the battery. You will want to read your multi-meter manual to determine that the test leads are in the proper connecting spots on the meter for measuring voltage and continuity, and that the meter is set to DC voltage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0If your multimeter has increments, set it for the next number higher than the voltage you\u2019re testing. For example, if your digital multimeter has settings for 2, 20, 200, and 2,000 volts, choose 20 since it\u2019s the next highest number to the expected 12+ volts in a car battery.\u00a0\nThen, it\u2019s a matter of attaching or touching the black lead to a ground source and probing your circuit with the red lead. Watch the display for your voltage reading.\u00a0\n\nTesting Batteries With a Multimeter\n\nBefore you learn how to test a car battery, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. A multimeter itself is going to test one thing on the battery, and that\u2019s to measure voltage. A battery test at AutoZone has an advantage in that it\u2019s going to simulate a starting load on a battery. Many bad batteries will appear to have full voltage, but when it comes to holding that voltage under load, the battery reveals it is bad. There are several things you can do at home to simulate a load, which we will walk through, but none is as good as a thorough load \u2013test that AutoZone can perform.\u00a0\u00a0\nNext, you should only test a battery after it\u2019s been sitting unused for at least an hour. This is known as \u201cresting voltage\u201d. If you test it immediately after use, you can receive a false reading from a unit charged by your car\u2019s electrical system, also called a surface charge. Once you\u2019re sure you can use your multimeter, you\u2019re ready to get started.\u00a0\n\nHow to Test a Car Battery with a Multimeter\n\nUsing a Multimeter to test a car battery\n\n1. Prepare Your Multimeter\n\nSet your multimeter to voltage and ensure its adjusted to 20 DC volts, or if your voltmeter does not have incremental settings (2, 20, 200, 2,000) then simply set it to DC volts. \n\n2. Touch the Probes to Your Battery Terminals\n\nPress each probe to the correct terminal to test your battery, touching negative to negative and positive to positive. Your multimeter and battery are probably both color-coded, so the negative terminal and probe will be black while the positive terminal and probe are red. \n\n3. Check the Reading\n\nTake a look at the initial reading with the vehicle off. If the battery is below 12 volts to start with, the battery is immediately suspect. Starting voltage on any battery is 12.4 volts or more. At this point, you\u2019ll want to remove the battery and have it tested at AutoZone. If the battery is extremely low (8 volts or below) its generally not a good idea to jump-start the battery as this can cause a massive strain on the alternator. If the battery voltage is above 12 volts, turn the vehicle\u2019s key to the run position and check the multimeter. It\u2019s a good idea to write down the reading. Then, compare it to the voltage figures below. See if you have a large drop in voltage once the vehicle is switched to run.  \nThe temperature outside affects the voltage of the battery. At about 80 degrees, a fully charged battery will be around 12.5 to -12.6 volts. To be more specific: a fully charged battery ideally measures at 12.66 volts and above, but 12.6 volts at 80 degrees, 12.588 degrees at 30 degrees, and 12.516 volts at 0 degrees are acceptable readings. A 75% charged battery will measure closer to 12.45 volts while anything below 12 volts indicates the battery is effectively discharged. \nIf you get a reading between 12.3 and 12.5 volts and have the ability to charge the battery, try charging the battery up to full, which shouldn\u2019t take long. Next, turn on the headlights, and the heater blower motor and check the voltage. The voltage should drop by a few tenths, but shouldn\u2019t be drastic. At this point, if the car still is not starting \u2013 meaning you are getting a click or buzz when attempting to start \u2013 , do a multi-meter test on the battery while someone attempts to crank the car. Observe the reading as this happens. Most good batteries when a serious load like a starter is put on them will drop 1 to 1.5 volts during the load, then quickly return to full charge once over. If you notice the battery drop from 12.5 down to say, 8 or 9 volts or lower, this is an indicator that the battery may indeed be bad. \n\n4. Bring the Battery (or Vehicle) in to AutoZone\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, that jump-starting and driving on a potentially bad battery is not a good practice. A bad battery that cannot keep a charge puts an incredible strain on an alternator, which is not designed to put a high-amperage charge on a battery, unlike generators of old, which could do this. This is one of the prime reasons why many vehicle owners change out their battery, only to come back where they purchased the battery a few days later, angry that the battery has died again, only to then find out the worse news \u2013 the alternator is also bad. If you suspect the battery is bad based on your multimeter testing, remove the battery and bring it into AutoZone for further testing. If the vehicle will start on its own, bring it into AutoZone where it can be checked. If you do end up replacing the battery, you can learn\u202fhow to test your charging system here, or bring the vehicle back up to AutoZone for a charging system test. Don\u2019t assume once the battery is changed that everything has returned back to normal. \n\nFAQ for Testing Your Battery with a Multimeter",

        "title": "What Is a Car Battery Trickle Charger?",
        "content": "Trickle Chargers: What Are They and\u00a0How Do They Work?\n\nSo,\u202fwhat is a trickle charger and how do trickle chargers work? In essence, a trickle charger is a special type of battery charger designed to replenish a vehicle battery at a very low, slow rate. (The slow, gradual charging speed is actually why they\u2019re called \u201ctrickle\u201d chargers in the first place.) In most cases, the charge rate is about equal to the battery\u2019s natural rate of self-discharge. This makes it possible to leave the battery connected to the charger on a long-term basis, as there\u2019s little to no chance of it actually overcharging the battery and damaging it in the process. Other benefits of the \u201cslow and steady\u201d trickle charge approach to battery maintenance include:\n\nA better, more thorough charge that you can really trust\nA longer, more efficient lifespan for your battery\nA much more convenient way to keep your battery road-ready when your vehicles aren\u2019t in use\n\nFor best results, invest in a trickle charger that automatically self-regulates and goes into float mode once your battery is fully charged. If yours does not do this, you will definitely want to keep an eye on the process to make sure your battery doesn\u2019t wind up\u202fovercharged.\n\nTrickle Chargers as\u00a0Compared to Other Charge Methods\n\nOf course, trickle chargers aren\u2019t the only ways to keep a battery charged up and ready to go. That said, is it the\u202fbest\u202fway or simply something that\u2019s nice to have on hand? How does it stack up against other more commonly used ways to keep a battery charged or replenish a battery\u2019s charge from scratch once it\u2019s nearly been depleted? Here\u2019s a closer look at the answers to all of those questions and more.\n\nIf you already have a standard battery charger, you may be wondering why you can\u2019t just go ahead and use that to keep your batteries full. The answer is that you can, but it truly isn\u2019t what\u2019s best for the battery. Faster isn\u2019t always better and this is definitely an instance where that would be the case, as the faster the charge, the harder the process is on the battery. You don\u2019t want to use a standard charger on a long-term unattended basis at all,\u202fas it can be extremely dangerous. The battery can actually overheat and even explode.\nJumping your battery\u00a0to get it started is actually the hardest on its integrity, so it\u2019s something to refrain from unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency. It\u2019s definitely not a process to subject your batteries to as a rule.\nSimply making it a point to start your vehicles and drive them around every so often\u202fseems\u202flike an easy solution, so long as you have the time and patience to work it into your schedule. However, your vehicle\u2019s alternator doesn\u2019t actually put out much of a charge. Driving around the block a time or two definitely isn\u2019t enough to keep your battery fully charged, so you\u2019re likely not replenishing it to the extent most people think they are.\nYou can always drop your vehicle off at your favorite body shop for the day and have a mechanic handle the task of fully charging your battery. However, this isn\u2019t a convenient or cost-effective solution for most people.\n\nAt the end of the day, the right trickle charger can really take a lot of the guesswork out of keeping idle batteries fully charged. It\u2019s safer, it\u2019s more efficient, and it\u2019s a lot more convenient than many of the alternatives. It\u2019s also a much better solution for people who really need to be able to \u201cset it and forget it\u201d for the most part when it comes to managing stored vehicles or seasonal rides.\n\nMore Battery\u00a0Maintenance Tips To Know\n\nUsing the right charger is a good start when it comes to taking care of your batteries, but it\u2019s not the only thing you can do to maintain a battery\u2019s integrity, especially during charging. Always make sure your car battery\u2019s caps are in place before charging. Make sure your battery and the space around it is clear of any metal objects or materials before beginning the charging process. In the event there\u2019s a short, you don\u2019t want any sparks to be generated, as they\u2019re a fire hazard. You\u2019ll also want to refrain from wearing metal bracelets or rings while connecting or disconnecting a battery, as you can sustain burns.\n\nShop Car Battery Trickle Chargers",

        "content": "Why You Can\u2019t Just Throw it in the Trash\n\nYour\u202fcar battery\u202fuses lead and acid to retain a long-lasting and reliable charge.\u00a0Both of these\u00a0materials can pose a serious risk to the environment and your health. A sealed battery is safe to handle, but improperly disposing of a battery is dangerous.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t simply throw your battery in your household garbage or use your typical recycling method. These hazardous materials need to be disposed of carefully,\u00a0and, in most\u00a0cases, you\u2019ll be paid for getting rid of it.\u00a0What you don\u2019t want happening is a battery left to sit in a junk pile or a landfill, where the\u00a0lead\u00a0and sulfuric acid\u00a0can be a major environmental issue.\nThe EPA estimates that 98% of lead acid batteries are currently being recycled properly. Join this large percentage of Americans and find out how to safely remove, store, and recycle your old car battery. There are many ways to safely recycle car batteries, so find out how you can keep your environment safe and avoid any health issues related to improper battery disposal.\n\nSafely Removing a Car Battery\n\nWhether your battery has lasted three years, five years, or even 10 or more years, it may be past its prime. An old battery doesn\u2019t hold a charge as long, doesn\u2019t operate effectively in extreme temperature conditions and is prone to leakage. Before you replace your battery, however, you\u2019ll need to safely remove it.\u00a0\nHere are some simple steps to removing your car battery:\u00a0\n\nHow to Remove a Car Battery\n Safety\u00a0First First, you\u2019ll need to wear gloves and protection. Old batteries may have a leak and coming in contact with\u00a0battery acid\u00a0can be dangerous. Disconnect the\u00a0Negative Cable Disconnect the cable from the negative terminal of your battery. It should have a black or gray coating. You\u2019ll need to use a\u00a0wrench\u00a0to loosen the nut on the terminal. Be sure your wrench doesn\u2019t touch both terminals at once. Disconnect the\u00a0Positive Cable Remove the cable from positive terminal, which should have a red coating. Inspect and\u00a0Remove Once the\u00a0battery terminals\u00a0are removed, nearly all batteries will have a hold-down device in the form of a strap or block at the bottom of the battery. That will also need to be removed. After this, check to see if your battery has a clip, strap or other safety feature holding it in place. After these are removed, check to ensure your battery is free from cracks, punctures or other surface damage that may cause a battery fluid leak. A leaking battery requires extreme caution. Battery acid can be irritating, cause burns and even cause long-term health issues. \n\nStore Your Old Battery\n\nNow that you\u2019ve safely removed your old car battery, store it in a plastic bag. Use two bags or a thick, heavy-duty option to ensure the grease and grime of your old battery doesn\u2019t stain your vehicle as you transport the battery. Plastic bags will also ensure any battery fluid leak remains safely contained.\u00a0\nNever store or transport your battery on its side. Some\u202ftypes of car batteries\u202fhave vent caps which can\u00a0leak\u00a0acid if not properly stored upright. Be cautious of how you store and transport your battery to ensure it isn\u2019t jostled, tipped, or dropped.\u00a0All of\u00a0these harsh movements can easily damage your old battery.\u00a0\nWhile you can safely store your batteries standing upright in a plastic bag, it\u2019s best to remove them from your property as soon as possible. A lead acid battery in a plastic bag may still leak battery fluid. Don\u2019t let this risk stay in your area for longer than it needs to and find out how you can safely recycle them before any damage is done.\n\nReplacing the Battery\n\nNow that you\u2019ve removed the old car battery, you need to invest in a new one. We carry multiple battery options for most vehicles on the road today. Select a premium battery with a longer warranty for hassle-free performance. Talk to your local AutoZone associate for more information about the best car batteries available.\u00a0\n\nBring Your Old Batteries to AutoZone\n\nBatteries can be\u00a0safely\u00a0recycled at 3 places of note. Just about any municipality that has a hazardous chemical and item pickup/dropoff\u00a0can take old batteries of any kind. While these are often quick and easy methods, they also don\u2019t give you anything for your used battery, which is worth money due to the amount of valuable lead inside of them.\nThe second option is any metal recycling establishment. These places generally take scrap metal of all\u00a0kinds, and\u00a0will also pay you for your battery or batteries you drop off.\nHowever, a more convenient option for many individuals is to\u00a0drop off your battery at AutoZone\u00a0in exchange for a\u00a0gift card.\u00a0Keep in mind, with a new purchase, you\u2019ll be turning in your old battery for a core, but if you have an old battery that needs disposal, or several, you\u2019ll receive a gift card for every battery you drop off!\n\nHow to Return a Battery to AutoZone\n\nTo return batteries to AutoZoneThen fill out the Return Form (Section B on your shipping invoice) and include it with the product in its original packaging and/ or box.\nWhether you\u00a0have to\u00a0recycle batteries, oil, or just need to find a great deal on a new car battery, stop by your local AutoZone for more information.

        "title": "How Car Batteries Work",
        "content": "What\u2019s In a\u00a0Battery?\n\nAll batteries are composed of three basic components. Whether you\u2019re looking at the tiny\u00a0batteries in your key fob\u00a0or the sizable one in your car, you can expect to find these three elements:\n\nAnode\nCathode\nElectrolyte\n\nWhen electricity is discharged from a battery, electrons are released from the anode and travel to the negative terminal. Ions are also released into the electrolyte. This process is called an oxidation reaction.\nOn the positive terminal, the cathode is responsible for accepting electrons. This flow of electrons completes the circuit. The electrolyte is an essential part of the battery that bridges the gap between the anode and cathode. It creates equilibrium between the two terminals and prevents electrons from jumping directly from the anode to the cathode, meaning current must travel through a circuit to reach the terminal for the cathode.\nMany batteries you purchase are disposable. These batteries work in a single direction and have a limited amount of reactants. Once they run out of these reactants, they can no longer use chemical energy to produce electrical energy.\nElectrical energy comes from the movement of electrons from one object to another. A good conductor creates a more efficient flow, but electrons can flow through a great number of materials. The copper or other ductile metal in your wiring makes a great conductor, while the rubber coating doesn\u2019t. Our bodies are excellent conductors, so it\u2019s essential to always wear protective clothing and be cautious around batteries and electrical wiring. Touching the two terminals of your battery together with a conductor can create an electric circuit and poses a risk of electrocution.\n\nBasic Parts of a\u00a0Car Battery\n\nYour car battery, like most batteries used in modern electronics, is a rechargeable battery. This allows them to become recharged and continue to work far longer than a disposable battery. Here are the basic steps to understanding how a car battery works.\nA car battery is attached to your vehicle\u2019s SLI electrical system, or starting, lighting and ignition system. Your vehicle uses an\u00a0alternator\u00a0to supply power to the battery and your SLI system after ignition. A typical car battery is called a 12-volt lead-acid battery.\nWhile new car battery types are being used, most standard SLI batteries have six cells inside their case. These cells are all made of a lead plate and a lead dioxide plate. These plates, also called grids, work together to create two volts for each cell. That\u2019s why a six-cell battery is also called a 12-volt battery.\nThe lead plates of your lead-acid battery are submerged in sulphuric acid. This acid acts as a catalyst and triggers the reaction between your lead and lead dioxide plates. The result of this reaction is ions and lead sulphate.\nThe ions in this reaction form a chemical reaction with the plates and create hydrogen. This chemical reaction produces electrons. It\u2019s these electrons that bridge the gap between chemical reaction and electrical reaction. They speed around the two plates and create electricity, which is sent through the battery terminals and into your entire SLI system.\nUnlike a disposable battery, this reaction is reversible. With proper use, your car battery can last three years or more, as long as there\u2019s no physical damage to the exterior of your battery.\n\nWhat Car\u00a0Batteries Do\n\nThe battery has two main functions:\n\nSupply power to the starter so that it can start the vehicle\nStore electrical energy for running accessories in case of electrical system failure and/or when vehicle is not running\n\nBattery Design\u00a0Considerations\n\nGroup Size:\u00a0Size refers to the dimensions of the battery. It indicates length, width, height, and post configuration (which side the +/POS and -/NEG terminals are on). This ensures consistency among manufacturers the same way AA, AAA, etc. batteries are used for the batteries in your remote controls, flashlights, and so on.\nCold Cranking Amps (CCA):\u00a0Cold cranking amps is the amount of power (amperage) that the battery can deliver consistently over 30 seconds in cold (0F) temperature. The higher the CCA, the better a battery will be able to perform in extreme weather conditions.\nReserve Capacity (RC):\u00a0Reserve capacity is the amount of time that the battery can supply power to the vehicle when the key is off, or if the charging system fails. The technical definition is \u201cthe number of minutes a battery at 80 degrees can be discharged at 25 amps and maintain a voltage of 10.5 volts for a 12-volt battery\u201d. The higher the reserve capacity, the longer the battery will provide power before needing a charge and the longer the vehicle will operate on the battery power alone. This is an important factor to consider for a vehicle with accessories that require extra electricity such as light bars, winches, etc.\nNote:\u00a0Having the correct group size battery with more CCA and reserve capacity provides assurance to overcome potential electrical system problems. The higher CCA and RC you have, the better off you are when you encounter extreme conditions that might cause lower power batteries to fail.\n\nHow the Weather\u00a0Affects Batteries\n\nHeat is the number one cause of battery failure, and extreme heat can cause the water in a battery to evaporate. This can lead to corrosion of the internal components and battery failure.\nCold temperatures dramatically reduce the effectiveness of a battery. Electrons flow slower, reducing the amount of energy a battery provides. This results in a reduction of cranking power and sluggish starting. Batteries left in a discharged state are also susceptible to freezing, which damages internal components.\n\nDangers of an\u00a0Old Battery\n\nAlthough the chemical reaction can be reversed for a long time, you should still be cautious using an older car battery. Most warranties last up to three years, after which it\u2019s a good idea to find a replacement. Your battery may still be working effectively, but it\u2019s subjected to harsh temperature changes, bumps, and jolts while in your vehicle. Over time, your battery may crack, causing the acid to leak out into your engine compartment.\nBecause your car battery uses both lead and sulphuric acid, it can be hazardous to remove a damaged battery without proper protection. You\u2019ll also need to find a safe way to remove, store, and dispose of your battery. Don\u2019t place a battery on its side or top. When handling a battery, it\u2019s always a good idea to wear protective clothing, just in case. This is particularly true of older batteries, which may not be sealed. Old car batteries have a loose lid that can be easily opened, which could easily cause you to come in contact with lead and sulphuric acid.\nTo dispose of your old battery, bring it to your local AutoZone and consider swapping it for a new one. Don\u2019t wait until your battery ceases to function, look for warning signs that it may be time to upgrade your 12-volt car battery.\nOther signs of a battery that needs to be replaced include corrosion around the terminal or a short battery life. If you find your battery quickly runs out of power when your engine isn\u2019t running, it may be time for a new battery.\n\nFind a\u00a0New Battery Today\n\nNow that you know the basics of how batteries operate, you understand a little more about your remarkable vehicle. Your car battery is an essential part of your ignition system, so without it you won\u2019t be able to start your vehicle reliably. A dead car battery can leave you stranded, so it\u2019s an important part to keep up-to-date and well maintained.\nIf you\u2019re not sure how old your battery is, or whether it\u2019s still operating efficiently, stop by your local auto parts store. At AutoZone, we\u2019re happy to not only test your battery, but also help you remove your old battery, find the right car battery, install your new battery, and safely dispose of the old battery.

        "title": "What Motorcycle Battery is Best for You?",
        "content": "Motorcycle Batteries\n\nMotorcycle batteries maintain the same general structure as a car battery, but they are smaller in size, construction, mount, and weight. Also, the cranking amp specs will be different. All of the necessary and pertinent information for finding a good motorcycle battery can likely be found in the owner\u2019s manual or online for your particular make and model.\n\nTypes of Bike Batteries\n\nWhile every owner\u2019s manual will have some basic specifications laid out as to the appropriate size and capacity of a motorcycle battery, not every manual will specify the type of battery. Therefore, before selecting a battery as the best, it is necessary to understand the different types. There are at least four types of motorcycle batteries available, and each one has its pros and cons.\n\n1. Conventional\n\nConventional batteries or flooded cell batteries have been around for over 100 years. These are still a very common choice today, and these units come in at a significantly reduced price when compared to other models. These units are often shipped dry and require you to add the acid solution to the battery, and in many cases, then trickle charge afterward.\n\n2. Gel\n\nGel batteries are similar to conventional batteries in that they rely on an acid, or electrolyte, solution, but these use a gel form of electrolyte. These batteries are better for deep-cycling applications and rugged use. However, many people often confuse these batteries AGM batteries, which they are not. While some AGM batteries do use gel, not all manufacturers do.\n\n3. Lithium\n\nLithium or lithium ion phosphate batteries do not use acid or lead, making them slightly safer than other battery models. However, as these batteries rely solely on lithium-based cells, they can run into issues in the winter months. The main benefit of a Lithium battery is that they are extremely light compared to their lead counterparts. Also, despite being made for high-performance and incredibly light, these batteries are very expensive, and they might not be worth it for every rider, especially those in colder climates.\n\n4. AGM\n\nAbsorbed glass mat or AGM batteries are also lead-acid batteries. However, instead of using a flooded cell construction, these models use fiberglass mats to hold the electrolyte solution. These batteries are the pinnacle of motorcycle batteries as they maintain the reliability of lead-acid models and reduce the risk. Also, this type of battery works in all weather conditions, unlike the lithium model. Therefore, when it comes to the best battery, you are probably looking for an AGM.\n\nBest Battery for Your Motorcycle\n\nWhile AGM batteries are great for most riders, is it right for your specific bike? What does your manual say? The AGM is a versatile model, and it has a lot to offer most riders, especially those living in colder climates. While lithium models are high-performance, if you live in colder areas, they are less effective. However, as stated previously, the answer to which motorcycle battery is best for your bike can often be found in the owner\u2019s manual, which should always be your first resource.\n\nCar Batteries as Motorcycle Batteries\n\nThere is a common question that comes up in the midst of any battery research. Can a car battery be used on a motorcycle? This question often comes up because batteries specifically designed for bikes, especially those designed for particular models, can get expensive. For starters, most car batteries are considerably larger than motorcycle\u00a0batteries, and therefore would never fit.\u00a0While you can technically use a car battery for a motorcycle, as they are both 12 volts, the sizing, weight, amperage, and terminal configurations are likely going to be different, requiring significant modifications.\n\nThe Best Battery All-Around\n\nThe best battery for a motorcycle, in general, is a universal powersport AGM battery. This type of battery gives you the dependability of a lead-acid battery without the concerns for safety. The components are sealed, and the separators made from microfiber help to reduce any risk of leakage. Also, these batteries are maintenance-free, meaning that you do not need to worry about activating or filling them. Additionally, as these are designed for motorcycles, they are constructed to withstand the vibration of the engine, and the universal construction ensures that they will fit your bike. However, the best part is likely to be the price, as they are far more affordable than lithium batteries.\nKeep in mind, that using a battery maintainer or trickle charger is crucial for any motorcycle or power sports equipment that you don\u2019t use regularly.",

        "title": "How To Charge a Lawn Mower Battery",
        "content": "When To Charge Your Mower\u2019s Battery\n\nYou may drive your mower for months without ever having to charge it. Still, there are some common times when you should hook your battery to a charger to ensure it has full juice. Here are some instances when you may need to charge your riding mower:\n\nBefore starting the mower for the first time early in the spring\nBefore storing your mower for the cold winter months\nBefore mowing if the battery is unexpectedly dead for some reason\n\nSaid another way, you likely do not need to charge your mower\u2019s battery routinely. Instead, you probably only need to connect the charger when your battery is unresponsive, or you are planning for startup or storage.\n\nThe Problem With Older Battery Chargers\n\nBefore you charge your lawn tractor\u2019s battery, you should understand just how far battery chargers have come. In the past, chargers often lacked the ability to stop overcharging. The consequence of an overcharged battery is the release of toxic gasses from the power source.\nThat is no longer a concern. Today\u2019s battery chargers have built-in systems to prevent overcharging. As such, you can likely hook up your battery charger and forget about it. When you return, even after a number of hours, you should not have to worry about noxious gases harming either you or the natural environment.\n\nFeatures of Modern Battery Chargers\n\nAs mentioned, if you invest in a modern lawn tractor battery charger, you likely do not have to worry about many of the health hazards that are common with older chargers. Also, depending on the model you select, you can choose a variety of innovative features, including the following:\n\nMultiple mode settings, including slow charge, fast charge and jumpstart\nHookup failsafe to prevent improper connections\nIntegrated charging timer\nAutomatic shutoff\nClamps for multiple types of connections\nFloat modes for optimal charging\nControlled amp rates\n\nYou should note, however, that not all chargers on the market today come with all the above features. If you are looking to extend the life of your lawn tractor\u2019s battery, though, investing in a charger that has many of these options probably makes sense.\n\nHow to Charge a Lawn Mower Battery\n\nBefore you charge your mower\u2019s battery, you must be certain you are using the correct charger. Most lawn tractors made after 1980 have a 12-volt battery. If your mower does, be sure you connect a 12-volt charger. Note, though, some chargers allow you to toggle between 12-volt and 6-volt settings. If that is the case, be sure you opt for the setting that matches your battery\u2019s voltage.\nAdditionally, you want to use a charger with an output of 10 amps or fewer to charge your lawn tractor\u2019s battery. If you use one with a greater output, you risk damaging your mower\u2019s battery.\nIf you are wondering how to charge a lawn mower battery, you should know that you do not need to remove your mower\u2019s battery before charging it. Instead, leave your battery in place and follow these eight steps:\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPut on protective clothing, including gloves, and safety glasses.\n\n2. Disconnect the Charger\n\nUnplug the battery charger from the electrical outlet.\n\n3. Find the Battery\n\nAccess the mower\u2019s battery. On most lawn tractors, the battery lives beneath the seat. If you are having trouble locating your mower\u2019s battery, consult its operator\u2019s manual.\n\n4. Connect the Positive Side First\n\nConnect the red positive charging cable to the red positive battery terminal.\n\n5. Connect the Negative Side Second\n\nConnect the black negative charging cable to the black negative battery terminal.\n\n6. Match Voltage Between the Mower and Charger\n\nToggle the charger\u2019s voltage setting to match your mower\u2019s battery\u2019s voltage. Again, for most mowers made after 1980, the 12-vote option is the correct setting.\n\n7. Plug in the Charger\n\nPlug the battery charger into an electrical outlet.\n\n8. Wait\n\nWait until the battery has a full charge before disconnecting the charger.\n\nIf you are using a 10-amp charger, your mower\u2019s battery should charge in approximately one hour. Of course, connecting the battery to a lawn mower battery charger that has fewer amps may extend charging time.",

        "title": "What is the Starting and Charging System?",
        "content": "How Vehicle Starting and Charging Works\n\n1. The battery supplies power to your vehicle\n\nThe starting battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The three essential parts for this conversion are the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte.\n\nThe anode is the negatively-charged side of the battery\nThe cathode is the positively-charged side\nThe electrolyte is a buffer that separates the anode and cathode\n\nChemical reactions inside of the battery cause electrons to build up in the anode. Like with magnets, the similarly charged particles repel one another, but in a battery the electrolyte blocks these particles from merely switching sides by moving over to the opposite side.\n\n2. Battery cables and terminals carry current from the battery\n\nBattery cables connect the battery\u2019s terminals to the vehicle. One end of each cable is connected to either the negative or positive terminal.\n\nThe other end of the negative cable is often connected to the engine or somewhere on the vehicle\u2019s frame\nThe positive cable\u2019s other end is typically connected to the starter or a fuse box\n\nBecause the electrolyte keeps the charged particles from crossing the battery, electrical current moves from the battery, through the cables, and into the vehicle.\nCorrosion and loose connections can keep your cables from working the way they should. Be sure to inspect your cables for looseness or corrosion from time to time. If you have a problem, it\u2019s easy to tighten the cables or to remove corrosion with a wire brush.\n\n3. Relays, fuses, and the starter receive electrical current\n\nThe moment you turn the key to start in your car (or push the button) a signal is sent to a relay, or series of relays. The main relay in this group is referred to as the starter solenoid. The signal, coming from the ignition, is low amperage. When it hits these relays, and the starter solenoid, this engages a high-amperage current which directly engages the starter.\nYour vehicle\u2019s relays and fuses regulate current in the electrical systems.\n\nA relay is basically a switch that allows small currents to control accessories that would require heavy switches and wiring. Relays reduce the amount of wiring needed by having larger contact areas that can handle large amounts of current. The starter solenoid is generally one of the largest relays in your car because it handles such a huge amperage amount.\nMany vehicles have fuses in-line in their ignition system as well or a main battery or system fuse. These are often seen mounted either directly on the battery cable, or nearby in the engine\u2019s fuse/relay compartment.\nFuses protect your vehicle\u2019s electronic devices and wiring. If something like, say, your radio tries to draw too much current, the radio\u2019s fuse will blow, cutting off the current\u2019s path to the radio. This prevents the excess current from damaging the radio or melting wires in the system.\n\nAfter reaching the relays and fuses, current continues to the vehicle\u2019s various electrical systems.\n\n4. The starter turns the engine\n\nWhen the starter solenoid engages, the starter\u2019s gear, or \u201cbendix\u201d moves out to engage the flywheel or flexplate of the engine, turning it over. The turning of the engine allows the fuel air-mixture to enter into the engine cylinders for combustion, starting the engine.\nA clicking noise when you turn the key is a good indicator of low battery voltage that is sufficient enough to engage the relays, but not enough to turn the motor. Often times, you will hear a buzzing sound. This sound is your starter solenoid not fully engaging because of low or insufficient voltage. Or, in some cases, a click indicates that your starter has gone bad. In these cases, a visual inspection and/or removal and bench testing is needed, which AutoZone provides. If the starter is soaked with oil contamination and requires replacement, be sure the oil leak is repaired to prevent damage to the replacement starter.\n\n5. The accessory belt or serpentine belt drives the alternator\n\nOnce the engine is turning, rotational force from the crankshaft turns the belt pulley. The belt transfers this rotational force to other systems, like the power steering pump, the water pump, and most importantly for this article: the alternator.\n\n6. The alternator recharges the battery\n\nThe alternator is responsible for 2 things at the same time. It supplies voltage power to everything your car uses while it is running. While doing this, it also sends charge to the battery to maintain its charge as well, and in doing so, the battery acts as a capacitor. An alternator works no different than a windmill or turbine, generating AC power, which is then converted to DC power inside the alternator. The 3 items responsible for this inside the alternator are the rotor, stator, and rectifier. The alternator works similarly, except it is turned by the belt rather than a hand or the wind. The two components responsible for generating electricity are the rotor and the stator:\n\nThe rotor features magnetized finger poles that rotate surrounding the wire field winding. Each finger pole is a different length to produce alternating north and south poles for the winding.\nThe stator is just enough larger that the rotor can spin without touching the stator walls.\nA rectifier is in a sense a valve. It converts AC power (Alternating Current) into DC power (direct current).\n\nThe spinning magnetized poles generate current in the winding, and this current provides the power that charges your battery. Inside your alternator, a voltage regulator makes sure that this voltage is maintained at a proper level for your car\u2019s electrical system. This is usually somewhere between 14-16 volts.\nTest your alternator using an alternator/battery tester or voltmeter (Learn how to test an alternator here). Ensure the drive belt is in good condition and does not slip on the alternator pulley. A dead battery, one that won\u2019t stay charged, or headlamps and interior lights that appear dim can indicate that your alternator is possibly bad. Visually inspect your alternator for signs of the problem. If the alternator is replaced, be sure the battery is fully charged before starting the engine. This will prevent overload and potential damage to the replacement alternator. If the drive belt shows signs of wear, replace it to ensure the alternator will perform properly. If equipped with an automatic belt tensioner, inspect it for wear and binding/sticking. If it does not move smoothly it should be replaced along with the belt.\n\nRemember that AutoZone can help with any of your Battery, Alternator, or charging system needs through replacement parts or testing.

        "content": "How Car Battery Type Affects Performance\n\nBattery type affects performance in small but important ways because each design for a battery has a different performance range. They only vary slightly in voltage, but their construction also determines how fast they charge and how much energy they can store. Some battery types are typically only used in recreational vehicles and boats in modern constructions, but you should always check to see what kind of battery you have before buying an upgrade. We separate out powersport and marine batteries by application to make finding the right kind simple.\nThe battery style can also affect the optimum temperature range for operations, so make sure you are shopping for batteries that match both your car\u2019s power requirements and your climate. It\u2019s important to remember that as far as your car is concerned, the battery\u2019s cranking power, voltage, and maximum capacity are what matters. It might be possible to shift to another battery type to get better performance in extreme heat or cold.\n\nWhat Type of Battery Is a Car Battery?\n\nMost automobile batteries on vehicles made in the late twentieth century and later are or were flooded cell batteries or a variation thereof. Flooded cell batteries have a liquid electrolyte and can be replenished with distilled water. In recent decades, sealed versions of these batteries that theoretically do not need replenishing have become widespread. The theory behind sealed batteries is that without a path to evaporation, the electrolyte will not dehydrate and need to be replenished with water.\nOther notable battery types that can be manufactured in the power range and capacity to run your car include all the following, but they are uncommon in today\u2019s car market and more likely to be found in boats, scooters, and recreational vehicles. Performance batteries often make use of unconventional designs to achieve various goals, so it\u2019s worthwhile to understand them before committing to a battery upgrade.\n\n1. Valve-Regulated Batteries\n\nThese are another variant on the sealed battery, so the user needs to do no maintenance beyond charging it if it gets depleted too far. They are a little different from traditional sealed flooded wet cell batteries because the valves help keep electrolyte from spilling or shifting to another part of the battery with a sophisticated valve design. They can be manufactured in a few styles, including gel cell and AGM formats. They are the current state of the art design because they are so much harder to disrupt by jostling or upending than older designs.\n\n2. Gel Cell Batteries\n\nGel cells are the top end design for electrolyte use, gaining the advantages of a fluid electrolyte without the instability and chance of spilling. Dry cell batteries tend to be less expensive and less likely to last for an extended lifespan, but gel cell batteries are easier to keep stable at all temperatures, making them more consistently efficient across different driving circumstances. There are still limits to a battery\u2019s operating range, though, so make sure you are checking the temperature rating for any battery you buy for your car.\n\n3. Dry Cell Batteries\n\nDry cell batteries use a glass mesh to absorb the electrolyte, and operate much like wet cell batteries except the dry cell reduces spilling and allows the battery to be positioned in any orientation, which can be very useful when trying to fit a lot of power into a limited space.\n\n4. Deep Cycle Batteries\n\nThese batteries are incredibly common in recreational boating and camping, because many campers with power systems use them as the core component for storage. They can be recharged and carry a long operating life because of their deep power capacity. They also take a long time to fully charge, and this sustained power can make them ideal for many heavy operations. While they are less common on the automotive market, they attract designers of performance batteries who are looking to maximize the sustained output of the battery. Deep cycle batteries can allow for extended accessory use without the engine running, they can power additional lighting and environmental systems, and they can also provide a deeper well of power for higher cranking output in cold weather if you buy the right design.\n\nSelecting the Right Battery\u00a0for Your Vehicle\n\nThe right battery will depend a lot on your engine size and driving style. Some large capacity batteries that might look attractive on paper will probably turn out to be sized incorrectly for your vehicle, and other types might be unavailable in the power capacities your vehicle needs. To find the right numbers for your car\u2019s power needs, check out the owner\u2019s manual or technical handbook for your make and model year. You can easily find off-beat battery options that will work for your vehicle by searching according to these numbers.",

        "title": "Lawn Mower Batteries Explained",
        "content": "Battery\u00a0Overview\n\nMany ride-on lawn mower models feature a starting battery and alternator. There\u2019s also a voltage regulator on the mower to keep it charged and ready for the next use. otherwise you\u2019d end up with a dead battery. This may not be as inconvenient as being stranded in the middle of nowhere in your vehicle. But, you certainly don\u2019t want to be sitting on your mower on a lawn of overgrown grass with a battery that doesn\u2019t have the juice to get the machine started.\n\nHow the Battery Is\u00a0Different Than a Car Battery\n\nWhen you need to buy a new battery for your lawn mower, you don\u2019t want to head to your\u00a0local auto parts store\u00a0and pick out just any product. Your machine will require a specific battery with the right specs to power the mower. Shopping online can make your job easier, as you can filter your search for lawn mower batteries. These batteries are smaller than a car battery. Another key difference is the mower battery can last longer than a car battery. In fact, if you properly maintain the battery and take good care of it, you shouldn\u2019t have to replace it for years. Of course, you probably won\u2019t use the lawn mower nearly as often as you start up your vehicle. Still, even with much less frequent use and a lot of sitting idle in your garage or shed, the battery should be as effective in five years as it is today.\nYou\u2019ll also love that lawn mower batteries won\u2019t cost as much as a car battery. This difference can help your pocketbook now when you need to purchase a new one and in the long run, as you won\u2019t need to buy one as often. Mower batteries don\u2019t require a starter with the same size starter as a car, either. This means the cold crank cranking amps (CCA) are about one-third of what you would find with a vehicle.\n\nSimilarities Between a\u00a0Lawn Mower Battery and a Car Battery\n\nThough your lawn mower battery is powering a completely different machine than a car, there are some features that resemble those of a vehicle battery. You\u2019ll have to pay attention to corrosion issues with your mower battery, just as you would with a car battery. This is because a mower battery has comparable acid content and antimony. You should clean off the corrosion buildup from the terminals often. You can do this with hot water, baking soda, and a toothbrush. Doing this can improve performance and help it last longer.\nA car battery uses cells with lead plates to power it. These cells are submerged in an acid electrolyte. Your motorcycle battery will act similarly. Also, sulfate covers the plates, and the acid turns into alkaline when the battery discharges. As it charges again, the sulfate will return to the acid electrolyte and it becomes acidic. This process is much like what you would find with your car battery.\nThough the battery in your lawn mower is physically smaller than the one in your car, it will also run on a 12-volt electrical system.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Battery:\u00a0Ratings and Size\n\nAs you start shopping for a battery for your mower, you\u2019ll probably ask, \u201cHow are lawn mower batteries rated?\u201d These, too, use the CCA measurement. CCA is an indication of how much current the battery is capable of sending at zero degrees Fahrenheit in 30 seconds. While you may have attempted to\u00a0start your car in these cold temperatures, it\u2019s difficult to imagine why you would need to mow your lawn under these conditions. Still, the ratings can give you a good idea of the battery\u2019s capabilities and reliability, even after years of use.\nFor a typical riding lawn mower, you would want to shop for something that has at least 145 CCA. However, larger models with bigger engines of more than 12 horsepower will require a battery with up to 300 CCA. To make sure, you can check the old battery\u2019s label, or the owner\u2019s manual or manufacturer\u2019s specifications for your mower. The vast majority of lawn mower batteries are all very similar and part of the U-1 group size. These consist of U1, U1-R (reverse posts) and the rarer U1-3 which is simply a higher cranking amp version.\nWhen it comes to their ratings, you\u2019ll notice that most batteries are rated according to their size. Your mower battery will probably fall into the Group U1 category, which means it is 8.3 inches long, 5.1 inches wide, and 7.25 inches high. Don\u2019t disregard this size description; it\u2019s important that you can fit the battery comfortably and firmly in the tray and engine compartment. You\u2019ll need to be able to connect the battery cables to it as well.\n\nHandle\u00a0with Care\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a lawn mower battery, make sure it has the right CCA rating and fits correctly into your machine. There\u2019s no reason why this product shouldn\u2019t serve you well for many years and countless uses. Cut your grass dependably with a mower battery you can feel good about.

        "title": "How Long do Car Batteries Last? A Car Battery Life Guide",
        "content": "Average Battery Lifetime and Charge\n\nBatteries live a mysterious and misunderstood life. While some batteries offer clues that failure is coming, many do not. While we\u2019d all like to have an avid array of warnings that battery failure is coming, it\u2019s good to first prevent some of the big issues causing battery failures, and next, react quickly when clues present themselves that something may be wrong.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that no battery lasts forever, but certain things can reduce the life of a battery, and sometimes very quickly. Whether you\u2019re keeping your car in storage all year or driving it every day, you\u2019ll still need to replace your battery at some point. Typically, the average car battery life is between three and five years. Pushing a battery longer than five years, even under perfect driving conditions, could cause your battery to fail without notice. For that reason, many manufacturers recommend a replacement schedule of five years.\n\nWhy Do Car Batteries Die?\n\nCar batteries are designed for one purpose \u2013 provide a powerful, quick, high-amperage current to the starter to start the car, and then constantly have this charge of 12.6 volts maintained by the alternator once the car is running. The following things, however, can cause a battery to either not retain that charge, or not supply the proper current to start the car.\n\nSlow discharging / recharging: All batteries, if left untended, very slowly discharge from 12.6 volts. But unlike its cousin, the deep-cycle battery, a car starting battery is not meant to be discharged beyond it\u2019s starting cycle, and charged again over a multitude of times. Often times, this rears its ugly head when a battery is left in a vehicle that hasn\u2019t started for a long period of time, or, the vehicle has a parasitic drain or draw that is stealing voltage as the car sits. When this happens, in most cases, the battery must be recharged, or worse yet, the car is jumped-started and the alternator is left to do the work of charging a dead battery, which it\u2019s not meant to do. Either way, a starting battery can only take so much of this before it loses the ability to be recharged. More so, time can wear on a battery here, where after so many years and start cycles, the battery again loses its ability to maintain a charge. This often becomes very apparent in frigid temperatures, where an engine needs more amperage to start, and a cold battery supplies even less.\nStructural failure: Batteries are made up of a series of lead grids, submersed in electrolyte, which in this case is sulfuric acid. They also live a hard life, being bumped around with a car\u2019s movements and suspension, and subject to massive, rapid temperature changes either inside an engine compartment, or going from a hot summer day to freezing temperatures in the winter. Because of this, some batteries can simply have an internal structural failure, which many people have labeled a \u201cdead cell\u201d. Many times, failure is due to a loss of electrolyte, which causes one of the grids, or cells, to become exposed to the air. The battery is fine one minute, next it\u2019s not, it cannot take a charge, and therefore must be replaced when any structural failure happens.\nRapid discharging or overcharging, or alternator failure: Similar to slow discharging, a rapid discharge or overcharge often happens when an alternator \u2013 the battery\u2019s source for maintaining charge \u2013 fails and causes issues. If an alternator begins to overcharge the battery, the electrolyte can boil over, leak, and eventually the battery fails. Opposite of this, if the alternator stops charging or a break in the charging circuit between the alternator and battery happens, the cars entire electrical and ignition system is now running off of the battery, which causes a quick and rapid drain. This failure also triggers the Battery Light, which is a bit of a misnomer as the Battery Light indicates that your charging system is not charging the battery, not that the battery is suddenly bad. In most cases, if an alternator issue is quickly identified, fixed, and the battery is properly recharged, the battery can be saved. However, the battery often fails at the same time as the alternator due to this rapid discharge, and it\u2019s many days until it\u2019s discovered.\n\nSigns That Your Battery is Failing\n\nBatteries don\u2019t always provide you with clues that there\u2019s a problem brewing, but many times they do. Remember that any battery over three years should immediately be suspect, as the clock is marching towards failure quickly. Check for any of these items below and if any are present, get the battery tested at AutoZone immediately:\n\nSlow starting: Slow cranking is a clear sign that the battery doesn\u2019t have as much power to start the car as it should. Over the average car battery life, you can expect minimal difference in the cranking speed, but it\u2019s accentuated when the battery is failing.\nSigns of leakage or corrosion: Check the tops of the battery for corrosion, or signs of acid in the battery tray below. While corrosion on the terminals doesn\u2019t condemn a battery immediately, that corrosion will eventually lead to a failed terminal. It calls into question how long should a car battery last. Leakage can often signal a structural failure or over-charging.\nSudden click or no-start: If suddenly your battery is dead \u2013 meaning, you turn the key and get a click or buzzing, jump-starting the car and going about your day is not the solution unless it\u2019s an emergency. Many times, the headlights or dash lights will work fine, but the car will click when you try to start it. Get the battery charged and tested immediately, along with other parts of the charging system. If the issue continues after battery replacement, the chances of a parasitic draw on the battery are likely and it will need to be checked out.\nA very bad smell: The tell-tale sign of sulfuric acid is a rotten-egg smell. If you smell this, the chances are your battery is very unstable, and more than likely either being overcharged, or has an internal structural failure.\n\nHow to Prevent Battery Failure\n\nHow to prolong your car\u2019s battery life\nRoutine testing and keeping track of your battery\u2019s lifespan will give you a clear idea of when to replace a car battery. As your battery nears the end of its life, it\u2019s time to consider the best battery replacement and budget for a replacement. In the meantime, however, several things can be done to get the most out of your battery life.\n\nLong time between starts? Use a maintainer: A battery maintainer keeps an on-demand low-amperage charge on your battery, eliminating any slow discharge. Remember, that slow discharge, and recharge will eventually kill a perfectly good battery. Learn more about different types of battery chargers here.\nGet the corrosion off: Periodically check the battery terminals for corrosion and keep the posts and clamps clean. Battery corrosion washers and dielectric grease will help aid in keeping corrosion at bay.\nDon\u2019t power accessories for long periods: Again, your car battery is used for starting, not accessories. If you are someone who throws the stereo on in the truck out at the campsite to listen to the football game over the weekend, or you spend any time powering items with the car off, consider either an auxiliary battery or a deep cycle-starting combination battery that is better suited for discharge and recharge.\nDon\u2019t remove heat/protective blankets: Many vehicles come equipped with protective heat blankets or shields around the battery. Over time, these devices break down or get removed and discarded. They\u2019re designed to protect the battery from the hot elements under the hood, so keep them around.\nTest your battery frequently: Finding out your battery is bad in a frozen, empty parking lot at night is not a good thing. Finding out your battery needs to be replaced while getting tested in an AutoZone parking lot is way less stressful.\n\nWhatever replacement battery you choose on replacement, the important thing is to keep track of what\u2019s going on with your vehicle and know when you need to test or replace the car battery. You may not experience any warning signs, but a battery test and consistent schedule are essential for preventing sudden failure. Whether you replace your battery every three years or extend its life to five years or more, carefully monitor its power and ability to maintain a charge. This will reduce your odds of being stranded and keep your vehicle powered as you cruise down the road. You can fulfill all of your battery needs at your local AutoZone.",

        "title": "Car Batteries Explained",
        "content": "What Is a\u00a0Car Battery Size?\n\nThe automobile battery size refers to the physical dimensions of the battery. While this seems straightforward, it\u2019s important to remember that the size doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything more than the height, length, and width. A larger battery, for instance, isn\u2019t automatically more powerful than a smaller battery. Much the same way a small leather hiking boot could be stronger than a large sandal, there are other factors involved.\nThe group sizes are standardized by the Battery Council International, who provide each battery\u2019s dimensions in both inches and millimeters. The group numbers are generally two digits and may be followed by a letter. 24F, for instance, is a common battery size that fits many Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and Acura vehicles.\u00a0 \nIf you have an old battery for your automobile, it should have the group size listed on it. You can also look it up by checking your service manual or searching for the information on the internet. Once you have the BCI group size, you can move on to the other details.\u00a0 \n\nWhat Other Information Do You Need To\u00a0Know About Your Battery?\n\nIn addition to the size, your car uses a battery with a specific terminal type, terminal configuration, mounting system, polarity, number of cranking amps, and number of cold cranking amps. You could easily own two sedans that use radically different batteries, even if the style of the vehicles is relatively the same.\nIt\u2019s essential to have this information when searching for the right product because BCI codes are used on many batteries. Utility vehicles, trucks, golf carts, and go karts also use batteries similar to cars. A unit with the same group size as your car\u2019s might fit in the right spot but it won\u2019t be able to start your engine unless it has the right specifications.\u00a0\u00a0 \nCold cranking amps, in particular, are critical to your battery\u2019s operation. Cold weather puts more stress on both your vehicle and your battery. A minimum amperage is required for your car to start and your battery\u2019s CCA has to meet or exceed this number.\u00a0 \nWhile this can be a little overwhelming, keep in mind that some of this is included in the BCI code. You should also be able to find the relevant information on an old battery, the service manual, or an informative website.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nMeasuring Battery Power\n\nThree traditional measures of battery power are listed right on the label. \nCranking Amps (CA)\ufeff \u2013 Indicates the number of amps a new, fully charged battery can deliver continuously at 32\u00b0 F for 30 seconds while maintaining a voltage of at least 7.2 volts.\n\nCold Cranking Amps (CCA) \u2013 Refers to how much power the battery can generate while \u201ccold,\u201d specifically when starting the engine. This measures the battery\u2019s ability to go from not in use at all to providing a lot of power quickly. Modern vehicles start very quickly so cold cranking amps are not as important on later-model vehicles.\n\nReserve Capacity (RC) \u2013 Shows the number of minutes at 80\u00b0 F a battery can be discharged at 25 amps and maintain at least 10.5 volts for a 12 volt battery.\n\nHow Long Does a\u00a0Battery Last?\n\nThis can be a complicated question to answer because so much of it depends on your vehicle and your driving. While your alternator keeps your battery charged, it can\u2019t hold a charge forever. Batteries have an amp hour rating that provides an approximate number for their longevity. It\u2019s not always written on the label and may not even be in the product description, making it hard to know exactly.\n\nHaving said that\u00a0the size of a battery doesn\u2019t necessarily translate directly to its AH rating. Having said that, larger batteries generally last longer while smaller batteries have less staying power. If shopping online, contact the website directly to get manufacturer information on AH values.\u00a0\n\nRegardless of the AH rating, there are some things you can do to increase the life of your battery. Ensure your battery is properly mounted and installed tightly to prevent internal damage. Safely cleaning your terminals from time to time can minimize the spread of corrosion.\u00a0Practicing good repair and maintenance habits\u00a0also\u00a0helps your car run well, which puts less stress on the battery.\u00a0\n\nHow Does Weather\u00a0Affect Batteries?\n\nHeat is the number one cause of battery failure, and extreme heat can evaporate the water inside the battery. This can lead to corrosion of the internal components and battery failure\nCold temperatures dramatically reduce the effectiveness of a battery. Electrons flow more slowly, reducing the amount of energy that the battery provides. This results in a reduction of cranking power and sluggish starting. Batteries left in a discharged state are all susceptible to freezing, which damages internal components\n\nWhat Are the\u00a0Different Types of Batteries?\n\nLead-acid batteries\u00a0are the most common kind. They consist of an outer casing that\u2019s filled with battery acid. The terminals correspond to positively and negatively charged lead plates in the acid. They may not perform as well as more advanced batteries, but lead-acid models are more than adequate for most purposes. They also tend to cost the least.\nEnhanced flooded batteries (EFB)\u00a0are built in a similar style to lead-acids but give up to double the cyclical stability. Their construction makes them tougher for better resistance to discharging and vibration. They\u2019re more expensive but also tend to last longer. If your vehicle has stop-start technology, it may have come with an EFB.\nAbsorbent glass mat (AGM) batteries\u00a0are the most expensive models with the best power. This style became popular in the 1980s after proving its reliability on military vehicles. The name comes from a fine fiberglass mat that is soaked with acid. This makes the battery spill proof, which is excellent for off-road applications. Perfect for high-powered features, you find AGM batteries on sports cars and luxury automobiles.\n\nDoes AutoZone Take\u00a0Old Batteries?\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble with your battery or your battery is more than four years old, don\u2019t buy a new one before you figure out the issue. Bring the battery by for a test, if it tests low,\u00a0AutoZone stores can charge your battery for free.\n\nWhile it\u2019s tempting to buy a high-tech model, you should check your power needs first. Most cars only have basic power requirements that can be fulfilled by a lead-acid battery. Unless you do a lot of off-road driving or have complex systems on-board, you may not need an EFB or AGM battery. On the other hand, if you just had a custom sound system installed, you might\u00a0need an\u00a0AGM unit to create enough electricity.\u00a0\n\nNow that you know how to choose a car battery size for your vehicle, you can save money by purchasing and installing it yourself.\u00a0Swapping out a battery is one of the simplest things you can do on your car. Keep it cheap and convenient by ordering your new unit online.\u00a0Find a\u00a0reliable lead-acid model or\u00a0get an advanced AGM battery for your high-performance machine.\u00a0You can get it delivered right to your door,\u00a0so you don\u2019t even have to go to the\u00a0local auto\u00a0shop.",

        "content": "Step-by-step guide to use with instructions\n\n1. Safety First\n\nThis job requires working with battery acid, which is toxic and highly corrosive. Make sure you\u2019ve got appropriate gloves and safety glasses before you do this. Standard latex safety gloves are not advised for this job. You\u2019ll want thicker gloves with some kind of rubber coating.\n\n2. Open the box\n\nHere\u2019s what you get in the box. Your battery, battery acid, caps for the battery ventilation tube, hardware for your cable leads, and a good set of instructions with your warranty card. \n\n3. Remove the seal\n\nWith your gloves and glasses on, start with removing the seal from the cell and from the caps. \n\n4. Remove the vent port cap\n\nNext, there\u2019s a cap on vent port. Now this long hose is the vent tube, and that goes on to the port that we just pull the cap off of. Take the longer, clear tube (ventilation tube) and attach it to the port you just removed the cap from.\n\n5. Cut open acid container\n\nHere\u2019s where your scissors come in handy. Cut the cap off of the acid container and attach a fill tube so we can pour the acid into the battery.\n\n6. Fill the battery\n\nFill each individual cell up to the upper level. Take your time and be safe doing this and be careful to avoid spills. If you do spill some acid, use a baking soda and water solution to clean it up safely. Baking soda neutralizes the acid and allows for a safe, simple cleanup.\nFill each cell up to the upper level line indicated on the side of the battery and dispose of the acid container safely.\n\n7. Clean up any spilled acid\n\nUse a baking soda and water solution (while still wearing gloves) to clean up any spilled acid or acid residue.\n\n8. Install the cell caps\n\nPut the caps on the battery. Install the caps by hand. Using tools may over tighten and create a chance to strip or break the caps.\n\n9. Charge the battery\n\nUse a battery charger to charge the battery. Connect the positive to plus, the negative to minus, set up the charger and turn it on. It is critical that the first charge is a full charge to get the longest life out of your battery. We recommend using a smart charger to ensure the battery does not overheat and gets the optimal charge. A smart charger will tell you when the battery is fully charged, and will automatically stop charging the battery when full, and restart the charging process when needed.\nIf at any time during the charging process you notice the battery getting hot, disconnect the charger, let the battery cool down, and then connect the charger again.\n\n10. Check the cell levels\n\nIf you notice a cell has dipped below the lower line, fill the cell to the line using distilled water. Distilled water doesn\u2019t contain any minerals that might harm the battery. Never add more battery acid. That will change the chemistry inside the battery and cause damage.",

        "title": "Optima Battery Types: Red Top vs Yellow Top vs Blue Top",
        "content": "What Type of Battery is an Optima Battery?\n\nThese batteries use an advanced form of AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technology called Spiralcell. This absorbent glass mat holds acid in place by absorbing it like a sponge. Optima\u2019s unique Spiralcell and Pureflow technologies give Optima batteries more than 15 times the vibration resistance compared to traditional batteries and make them maintenance free batteries that cannot be spilled. This means that the batteries will last longer and require less work from you.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of Optima Batteries?\n\n\ufeffUp to 2X Longer Life: Durable construction and high resistance to extreme temperature and vibration are why Optima batteries last up to 2 times longer than ordinary batteries.Strongest 5-Second Starting Power: They deliver a higher level of power to the starter in the critical first 5 seconds of the vehicle starting cycle.Leak-Proof & Maintenance-Free: Tightly sealed cells allow for mounting in multiple positions without leaking or damaging your vehicle.Resistant to All Damaging Factors: They are corrosion resistant and ideal for all types of weather and temperatures.Over 15X More Vibration Resistance: Damage from vibration can cause battery failure, but Optima cells are tightly compressed to withstand even the most severe vibration conditions.\n\n3 Reasons Why Optima Batteries Perform Like No Other Battery\n\n1. They are Made of Extremely Pure Lead\n\nOptima\u2019s components are made of 99.99% pure lead. Without impurities to get in the way, Optima conducts electricity faster to provide a much higher burst of starting power. Faster electricity flow in Optima\u2019s pure lead also allows it to recharge faster and hold its voltage longer as it discharges.\n\n2. They Use Spiral cell Technology\n\nEach of Optima\u2019s six cells uses AGM plates to hold the acid in place. These are wound into precisely compressed spiral cells and inserted into the case. This Spiralcell design naturally has more surface area than a conventional battery and provides an internal structural advantage that helps the cell hold its shape even under varying harsh conditions.\n\n3. The Case is Completely Sealed to Withstand Rough Handling and Harsh Environments\n\nUsing precision plastic welding techniques, the case is completely sealed, forming a one-piece, air-tight package. The result: no leaks, no engine compartment contaminants, no maintenance.\n\nWhat Optima Battery Do I Need?\n\nThere are a few  types of batteries available. The RedTop and YellowTop batteries are made to be the best performance automotive batteries, while BlueTop batteries are made for marine and ATV applications.\n\nGet the Highest Cranking Power Possible with a RedTop Battery\n\nThe RedTop provides the strongest 5-second burst of power every time you need to start your vehicle, making it perfect for those who value reliability. These batteries are ideal for providing clean ignition power to cars, trucks, and other vehicles that have properly sized alternators. This includes stock and modified vehicles that need a better primary starting battery.\n\nPower Energy-Hungry Electronics with a YellowTop Battery\n\nThe YellowTop is designed to handle the extreme cycling demands of modern vehicle accessories, which means it can withstand deep drains over and over.

        "title": "How to Install a Top-Post Car Battery",
        "content": "How to Change a Car Battery\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPark the vehicle on a dry, flat surface and set the parking brake. The ignition should be off. If the vehicle is warm, give it time to cool before starting the job. Wear safety goggles and gloves. Pull back long hair, don\u2019t wear loose clothing and take off jewelry. Don\u2019t smoke under the hood, especially around the battery.\n\n2. Disconnect Negative and Positive Battery Cables\n\nStart with the negative terminal and disconnect the negative battery cable. Look for a black cable and a minus (-) symbol. You may need to use a ratchet to loosen and remove the clamp. Once the clamp is off, move it safely out of the way. \nDisconnect the positive terminal after the negative terminal. Positive terminal has a plus sign (+) and the cable connected to it is usually red. \n\n3. Remove the Clamp and Battery\n\nMany top-post batteries will have a clamp or bar holding the battery in place. This is often secured with a bolt or some other fastener. Remove the clamp in order to remove the battery. Pull the battery out from under the hood and set it off to the side.\n\n4. Clean the Terminals\n\nLook for any corrosion left behind from the old battery. If you see corrosion or dust or dirt or other contaminants, you\u2019ll want to clean that up. Use gloves and a wire brush and wear a mask to avoid breathing dust during this step.\n\n5. Install the New Battery\n\nInstall the new battery securely and install the clamp same as it was before. Securing the battery is important to help it guard against vibration while driving.\n\n6. Apply Battery Washers and Grease\n\nOnce the battery is snug, place washers on the terminals and apply dielectric grease. Some, but not too much. You want to have enough grease to help the terminals make a connection, but not so much that the cables would have a chance to slip off. This will provide better connection for your battery.\n\n7. Connect Positive and Negative Battery Cables\n\nConnect the cables back to the terminal. Start with positive and tighten until snug. Do the same with the negative cable. Do not over-tighten the cables.\n\n8. Test the Vehicle\n\nWith both cables connected, try to start the car. Hopefully it fires up, and you\u2019re done. If it doesn\u2019t, wait a few minutes, check the connections, and try again. Do not try to start the car more than three times in ten minutes.\n\nLooking for a battery?

        "title": "How to Change a Side-Post Battery",
        "content": "Change a Side-Post Battery\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPark the vehicle on a dry, flat surface and set the parking brake. The ignition should be off, and if the vehicle is warm, give it time to cool before starting this job. Wear safety goggles, gloves, and pull back long hair. You should never smoke under the hood, especially when working on batteries.\n\n2. Disconnect Negative and Positive Battery Cables\n\nOnce your vehicle is turned off and cool, disconnect the negative ( \u2013 ) battery cable. This is a black cable. This is a side post battery, so there will be an 8mm fastener. Use an 8mm ratchet to loosen, and then move it safely out of the way. \nNext, disconnect the positive terminal, which is always identified with a plus ( + ) sign, just as the negative is with a minus sign. It is very important that your ratchet or wrench not come in contact with anything that could be a ground, because this will cause sparks around the battery.\n\n3. Remove the Battery\n\nLook for something holding the battery in place. This can be a clamp or a bar. You\u2019ll want to loosen or remove this to free the battery to be removed. Once the battery is free, take the battery out. It\u2019s heavy, so steel yourself.\n\n4. Clean the Terminal\n\nStart with the bolt and clean the terminal until the metal is shiny. Use a wire brush for this step. Clean metal will create better conductivity, and corroded metal can get in the way of the battery\u2019s ability to help start the car. Avoid breathing in dust during this step. You may want to wear a mask as well.\n\n5. Install the New Battery\n\nPlace the new battery. When you do this, go ahead and install the clamp or bar or whatever is holding the battery in place. This stabilizer is very useful in preventing vibration and helping the battery last longer. Use some terminal grease on the battery terminals to encourage conductivity with the cables.\n\n6. Connect Positive and Negative Battery Cables\n\nAt this point, connect the cables back to the terminal. Start with the positive and connect until it is snug. Do the same with the negative cable. Apply terminal grease here as well, to prevent corrosion.\n\n7. Test the Vehicle\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to turn in your old battery at AutoZone for core credit. If the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nLooking for a battery?

        "content": "PICKING THE RIGHT BATTERY\n\nTalk to an AutoZoner at your local AutoZone about your vehicle and your needs to help guide you through the battery selection process, or enter your vehicle on\u00a0AutoZone.com\u00a0for recommendations that fit your vehicle. AutoZone carries Duralast, Duralast Gold and Duralast Platinum Batteries \u2013 each with their own design, warranties and power specifications. \n\n DURALAST \u2013 2 YEAR WARRANTY \n\n Proven Tough Duralast Batteries come with a 2 year warranty and provide ample power and cold cranking amps for most situations. Duralast batteries are built for vibration resistance, longer life, more power and quick starts \u2013 even in extreme weather conditions. \n\nDURALAST GOLD \u2013 3 YEAR WARRANTY\n\nDuralast Gold Batteries are heavier, equipped with more lead plates for greater vibration resistance and more power. These batteries are ideal for vehicles with high power demands like heated seats or infotainment systems. \n\nDURALAST PLATINUM \u2013 3 YEAR WARRANTY\n\nDuralast Platinum Batteries power more with flat-plate Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) technology. Duralast Platinum batteries are sealed and spill-proof, extremely vibration resistant, mount in almost any position and carry two-times the deep cycle capacity of a Duralast Gold Battery. Duralast Platinum Batteries are the best choice for starting your vehicle and maintaining all your power demands. Comes with a 3 year full replacement warranty. \n\nMEASURING BATTERY POWER\n\nThree traditional measures of battery power are listed right on the label.\nCranking Amps (CA) \u2013 Indicates the number of amps a new, fully charged battery can deliver continuously at 32\u00b0 F for 30 seconds while maintaining a voltage of at least 7.2 volts.\nCold Cranking Amps (CCA) \u2013 Refers to how much power the battery can generate while \u201ccold,\u201d specifically when starting the engine. This measures the battery\u2019s ability to go from not in use at all to providing a lot of power quickly. Modern vehicles start very quickly so cold cranking amps are not as important on later-model vehicles.\nReserve Capacity (RC) \u2013 Shows the number of minutes at 80\u00b0 F a battery can be discharged at 25 amps and maintain at least 10.5 volts for a 12 volt battery.\n\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\n\nBatteries have a lot of measures for their performance, but ultimately your vehicle, how you operate it and the warranty length should have the biggest influence on your decision. Live in a moderate climate and don\u2019t run a lot of accessories? Proven Tough Duralast may be the way to go. \nUsed to harsh winters or blistering summers and spend a lot of time blasting the A/C or powering up heated seats? Probably want to upgrade to Duralast Gold or Duralast Platinum. When you\u2019re ready to get your next battery, stop by your local AutoZone or visit\u00a0AutoZone.com\u00a0for specific recommendations.\n\nOther Duralast Parts\n\nWe carry many Duralast replacement parts for most DIY repair jobs.

        "title": "How to Jump Start a Car Battery",
        "content": "How to Jumpstart a Car Battery\n\nHow to Jump Start a Car\n\n1. Safety first\n\nBefore beginning ensure your clothing and jewelry do not interfere during the procedure. It\u2019s a good idea to wear protective gloves and goggles if you can, and keep loose hair or clothing tied up. NO smoking allowed near the batteries to stay precautionary of your surroundings.\n\n2. Inspect and clean your jumper cables\n\nMake sure the connectors and wires are in good shape and rust free. Clean the clamps before attaching them to the car batteries. Even unused clamps may have gunk if they\u2019ve been sitting in your garage or the trunk of your car for an extended period of time.\nIf you have a portable jump starter, it likely comes with cables. These are the ones you\u2019ll want to inspect.\n\n3. Park near your working vehicle\n\nPark a working vehicle next to yours. Pop both hoods and secure them. Make sure the batteries are close enough for the cables to reach and not interfere with moving parts under the hood. Turn off both cars, and set the automatic gear to park. For a manual transmission vehicle, use the neutral setting. Apply the parking brake in both vehicles.\nIf you\u2019re using a portable jump starter, you won\u2019t need another vehicle. Just set the jump starter in a secure place.\n\n4. Identify your cables\n\nIt\u2019s important to connect the jumper cables to the correct battery terminals. The red connector clamp will connect to the positive battery terminal/post and the black connector clamp will connect to the negative battery terminal/post.  The positive battery terminal/post is denoted by a plus (\u2018+\u2019) symbol and the negative battery terminal/post is identified by a negative (\u2018-\u2018) symbol. Follow the next steps precisely to stay safe.\n\n5. Connect your cables\n\nConnect one end of the red clamp to the positive terminal of the working vehicle. This is denoted by a circled (+).Connect the other red clamp to the positive terminal of the dead car battery.Connect a black clamp to the negative terminal of the working vehicle. This is denoted by a negative (\u2018-\u2018) symbol.\nTo avoid \u2018sparks\u2019 close to the battery being jumped, connect the other black jumper cable clamp to a good ground on the engine such as a metal bracket. Some vehicles have a large steel or brass grounding stud that works well. This step grounds the connection.\n\n6. Double check your connections\n\nCheck to make sure that all the jumper cable clamps connections are secure. You should also keep the jumper cables from twisting and in a straight line. Caution: Make sure the jumper cables will not interfere with the moving engine parts of both vehicles.\n\n7. Start the engine of the working vehicle\n\nSlightly raise the engine speed to aid in boosting the battery. Then try to start your car. If this doesn\u2019t work, you may need to leave the working vehicle running for a couple of minutes. This will provide a new charge to the dead battery, assuming that it\u2019s not beyond repair.\nIf you\u2019re using a jump starter, this is when you would turn it on. Follow instructions to make sure you use the appropriate settings.\n\n8. Try to start the dead car\n\nIf the vehicle doesn\u2019t start immediately, you may want to try two more times. Make the second attempt three minutes after the initial try. Make the final attempt only after 10 minutes. If your car fails to start after that long, the battery is likely completely dead. You risk damage to the starter and related components with any additional attempts. At this point, you\u2019ll need to charge and test the battery to determine if it has completely failed. \nYour local AutoZone store provides free battery charging and testing. The alternator and starter can also be tested at AutoZone. If the battery was low and tests OK after being re-charged, there may be another problem such as the alternator not charging or a slipping alternator drive belt and/or belt tensioner. \nWhatever the case, AutoZone can test these components for free and provide you with Trustworthy Advice and all the right parts and tools for problem solving solutions.\n\nBy taking the steps listed here, you should be able to successfully jump-start your car. If not, then either the battery is totally dead or there\u2019s something else wrong with the vehicle.\nIf the battery was the culprit and needs to be replaced, you can rely upon AutoZone to get you the battery you need and get back on the road. We also offer free battery testing, so be sure to stop by America\u2019s #1 battery destination. If the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "When To Replace Your Car\u2019s Belts",
        "content": "Understanding the Role of Belts in Your Car\n\nYour car\u2019s engine is complex, and belts play a pivotal role in keeping it running smoothly. From driving the alternator to powering the air conditioning, belts are tied into most mechanical aspects of your vehicle.\nCars can have a few different types of belts:\n\nA serpentine belt \u2018snakes\u2019 around several pulleys in the engine bay to drive more than one accessory system. It\u2019s a reinforced ribbed belt that\u2019s driven by power taken from the crankshaft pulley, and it\u2019s often used for the power steering, water pump, and air conditioning systems.\nThe timing belt synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and camshaft. It has sturdy \u2018teeth\u2019 on the inner side that ensure the cam and crank pulleys stay in time. Some vehicles are equipped with a chain rather than a belt, so not all cars have this belt.\nOn older cars, you might find a separate alternator, AC, and/or power steering belt. These are typically V-belts that use tension to keep them taut.\nOn some forced induction cars, you\u2019ll find a supercharger belt. It ties the supercharger\u2019s operations with the rest of the engine so it can compress air and force it into the intake.\n\nSigns of Wear and Tear: When to Start Worrying\n\nAutomotive belts tend to be a combination of natural and synthetic rubber, reinforced by cotton and/or Kevlar strands to prevent stretching and wear. However, that\u2019s it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to last forever. When there\u2019s wear and tear, you\u2019ll start to notice symptoms such as:\n\nSqueaks, Squeals, and Chirping. Unusual noises coming from your engine could indicate a worn-out belt. Squeaks or squeals, especially during acceleration or deceleration, are common signs that one of your belts might need attention.\nCracks, Frays, and Chunks Missing. Regular visual checks are crucial. Look for visible cracks, fraying, or any signs of damage. Belts should appear smooth and free from any irregularities.\nPerformance Issues. If one of the belts is slipping, glazed, or stretched, it could mean that the system it drives won\u2019t work well anymore. For example, a bad power steering belt could make it more difficult to turn at low speeds.\nCheck Engine Light on. If the timing belt skips or a supercharger belt is damaged, it can cause changes that put sensors out of normal thresholds, triggering the Check Engine Light.\n\nThe Importance of Timely Belt Replacements\n\nBelts have a finite lifespan. Regular replacements can prevent unexpected breakdowns, ensuring your car\u2019s reliability and reducing the risk of being stranded on the road. While there isn\u2019t usually a set interval for replacing serpentine or V-belts, you can expect them to last between three and five years. If they aren\u2019t replaced and end up breaking, it can make it either uncomfortable or inconvenient to drive, but it doesn\u2019t usually come with lasting damage.\nTiming belts, on the other hand, often come with a replacement interval. It\u2019s common to be scheduled every 5 years or 60,000 to 100,000 miles. If the timing belt snaps, your engine simply won\u2019t run, and even if it skips, there\u2019s a chance that there\u2019s serious mechanical damage that results like bent valves and damaged pistons and connecting rods.\nWhile it might seem like a small expense, replacing belts at recommended intervals can save you from more significant costs.\n\nDIY vs. Professional Replacement: Making the Right Choice\n\nDIY repairs can be rewarding and changing a belt is a common repair for home mechanics, but it\u2019s essential to know your limits. Replacing belts requires some mechanical skill, so assess your comfort level before diving in.\n\nProactive Belt Maintenance Tips for Car Owners\n\nSet a regular maintenance schedule for belt inspections. This proactive approach can catch issues before they become critical and extend the lifespan of your belts.\nWhen replacing belts, choose high-quality replacements. Consider belts from trusted brand names for the best fit and performance, and only use the same size and style as your car used from the factory.\nYour car\u2019s belts may be small, but their role is significant. Knowing when to replace them is key to ensuring your vehicle stays healthy for a long time. Whether you choose the DIY route or opt for professional services, get your new belts at AutoZone today.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Understanding Engine Belts\n\nEngine belts\u00a0are\u00a0made of durable rubber or synthetic materials\u00a0and reinforced\u00a0with Kevlar, cotton, and other fibers to\u00a0provide\u00a0structure and prevent stretching. They\u00a0serve the crucial purpose of transferring power from the engine to various components, ensuring that everything\u00a0operates\u00a0in harmony.\nFrom driving the alternator to power your vehicle\u2019s electrical system to circulating coolant through the\u00a0water pump, engine belts play a pivotal role in the overall functionality of your vehicle. Understanding the diverse types of engine belts and their functions is essential for every car owner who aims to keep their vehicle running smoothly.\nRegular inspection and maintenance of engine belts are paramount to prevent unexpected breakdowns and extend the lifespan of these critical components. Over time, belts can wear down,\u00a0stretch,\u00a0or develop cracks, compromising their\u00a0ability to do their job\u00a0and putting your engine at risk. By\u00a0inspecting your belts during\u00a0your vehicle maintenance, you can catch potential issues before they escalate, saving you both time and money\u00a0in the long run.\n\nSerpentine Belts: The Powerhouse\n\nSerpentine belts are the backbone of the accessory drive system\u00a0for modern cars. Unlike traditional multiple belt\u00a0designs, a single\u00a0serpentine belt\u00a0drives multiple components simultaneously, such as the alternator,\u00a0power steering pump, and air conditioning compressor. This design not only\u00a0cleans up\u00a0the engine compartment but also enhances efficiency, reducing the number of belts that rob the engine of power.\nThe key feature of serpentine belts lies in their versatility and ability to handle high loads.\u00a0These belts are engineered to withstand\u00a0strenuous\u00a0conditions and\u00a0provide\u00a0the rotational energy for\u00a0two, three, four, or even more accessory systems.\nDespite their durability, serpentine belts are not immune to wear and tear. Regularly inspect your serpentine belt for signs of cracking, glazing, or fraying. If you notice any of these issues, replace the belt.\nSerpentine belts typically last between 50,000 to 100,000 miles, but environmental factors\u00a0and\u00a0driving conditions can\u00a0affect\u00a0their lifespan. Regular maintenance checks, especially before\u00a0leaving\u00a0on long journeys\u00a0and\u00a0before major seasonal changes,\u00a0can help you catch potential issues early.\n\nTiming Belts: Precision in Motion\n\nTiming belts\u00a0synchronize the movement of the engine\u2019s crankshaft and camshaft. This\u00a0\u2018timing\u2019\u00a0is crucial for proper valve and piston movement,\u00a0fuel injection, and more.\nTiming belts are commonly found in interference engines, where the clearance between the valves and\u00a0pistons\u00a0is minimal.\u00a0If a\u00a0timing belt\u00a0breaks or skips, it\u00a0can result in catastrophic engine damage, making regular inspection and replacement vital.\nTiming belts have specific replacement intervals that vary by make and model.\u00a0Generally, it\u2019s around 60,000 to 100,000 miles.\u00a0Neglecting to replace a timing belt within the recommended interval can lead to belt failure, causing the valves and pistons to collide. This collision can result in bent valves, damaged pistons, and extensive engine repairs.\nTo avoid these costly consequences,\u00a0change the belt on time Although it\u2019s\u00a0labor-intensive, it\u2019s a small investment compared to the potential damage that can occur.\n\nV-Belts vs. Ribbed Belts: Decoding the Differences\n\nV-belts and ribbed belts, also known as serpentine belts, serve similar purposes in transferring power from the engine to various components. However, their designs and applications differ significantly.\nV-belts, as the name suggests, have a V-shaped\u00a0cross-section\u00a0and are commonly found in older vehicle models. These belts fit into grooved pulleys,\u00a0providing\u00a0a secure grip and effective power transmission. On the other hand, ribbed belts have a flat, multi-grooved design that meshes with the pulley grooves, offering increased flexibility and\u00a0simplicity\u00a0in newer vehicles.\n\nV-belts\u00a0are used\u00a0in applications where a secure grip is essential, making them suitable for heavy-duty machinery and older vehicles. They are known for their ability to\u00a0transmit\u00a0high levels\u00a0of power.\nRibbed belts, with their smoother operation and flexibility, are commonly used in modern vehicles, contributing to improved fuel efficiency and reduced noise levels.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between V-belts and ribbed belts allows you to choose the right type for your vehicle, ensuring\u00a0optimal\u00a0performance and longevity.\n\nAccessory Drive Belts: Powering Your Vehicle\u2019s Ancillaries\n\nAccessory drive belts, also known as secondary or auxiliary belts, power\u00a0accessory\u00a0components in your vehicle such as the water pump, power steering pump, and\u00a0air conditioning compressor. These belts work in conjunction with the primary serpentine or V-belt to ensure the smooth operation of these auxiliary systems.\nDifferent vehicles may have varying numbers of accessory drive belts, each dedicated to powering specific components.\u00a0On older cars, it\u2019s common to have two or more V-belts, and on some\u00a0fairly recent\u00a0models, a single V-belt alongside a serpentine belt\u00a0isn\u2019t unheard of.\u00a0Regular inspection of these belts is\u00a0as\u00a0crucial\u00a0as any other.\nTo troubleshoot common accessory drive belt issues:\n\nListen for unusual noises, such as squealing or chirping, which may\u00a0indicate\u00a0belt slippage or wear.\u00a0\u00a0\nVisually inspect the belts for signs of damage, such as cracks or fraying.\u00a0\nEnsure that the belts are properly tensioned to prevent slipping\u00a0that can cause glazing.\n\nBy addressing accessory drive belt issues promptly, you can prevent secondary system failures and ensure that your vehicle\u2019s ancillary components\u00a0operate\u00a0optimally.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Timing belt vs timing chain: what\u2019s the difference?",
        "content": "What do timing chains and timing belts do?\n\nA modern four-stroke engine works on the cycle of \u2018suck, squeeze, bang, blow\u2019. It describes pulling in air to the cylinder, mixing it with fuel, compressing the mixture, introducing a spark that initiates combustion, and then releasing the exhaust out of the cylinder. All these actions have to happen in precise coordination for the engine to produce power and not blow itself up.\nYour timing chain or belt is connected to the crankshaft pulley at the bottom of the engine and to the camshaft pulley or pulleys at the top of the engine and is designed to turn the camshafts at a precise ratio, compared to the crankshaft, so that the dance goes off without a hitch.\nIn many modern engines, the valves that open for air and fuel intake and exhaust output actually share space with the moving piston, although never at the same time. This style of engine is called an interference engine and, as you can imagine, creates a requirement for those valves and pistons to be perfectly coordinated. If they step out of alignment for even a moment, the piston can strike and damage the valve, rendering the engine inoperable.\nYou might think that this is a terrible engineering decision, but interference engines are able to maximize efficiency and improve power delivery as a result of their risky engineering, so they\u2019re here to stay.\n\nThe difference between timing chains and timing belts\n\nEarly vehicles used chains or gears to manage the timing and belts only became common in consumer vehicles during the 1960s. In the 1990s, automakers moved back to timing chains and modern cars tend to have a timing chain.\n\nTiming Belts\nTiming belts are made of rubber and reinforced with other materials like Kevlar to add strength and stretch resistance. Some advantages of timing belts are:\n\nThey are lighter than timing chains, which benefits efficiency\nThey are simpler and less expensive to produce\nThe are quieter than timing chains\nThey don\u2019t require lubrication to operate properly\n\nTiming Chains\nTiming chains are typically made of steel and have these advantages over rubber timing belts:\n\nThey rarely stretch if lubricated properly, so provide consistently accurate timing\nTheir service life is much longer than a rubber belt \u2013 often the service life of the vehicle\nThey almost eliminate the fear of a catastrophic timing failure\n\nWhat are the maintenance costs for both?\n\nThe maintenance costs for a vehicle with a timing chain is mostly related to your oil change interval. If you change your oil regularly, according to your manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, it will protect the timing chain and keep it in peak condition for a long time.\nA timing belt does not require lubrication, and in fact, any oil or engine fluids that touch the rubber belt can damage the material and lead to failure over time. This is why timing belts are installed in a \u201cdry\u201d setup, away from engine fluids, while timing chains are lubricated in a \u201cwet\u201d setup.\nTiming belts do need to be replaced at a regular service interval, usually around 60,000 to 100,000 miles, and that cost can be extensive, since it requires the touch of an experienced mechanic. If you install a timing belt improperly it can severely damage the engine. Expect to pay between $100 and $400 for the parts and between $400 and $1,000 for the labor to replace your timing belt. Also, if your water pump runs off the timing belt then it can be wise to replace that at the same time, to avoid the extra cost down the road.\n\nHow long do timing chains last compared to timing belts?\n\nTiming chains last much longer than belts, especially when maintained properly. One of the best things you can do for your timing chain and your engine as a whole is to provide regular oil changes and always replace the oil filter at the same time.\nEvery manufacturer has a prescribed replacement interval for vehicles that use a timing belt, and you should honor that interval. Remember that a timing belt replacement may cost up to $1,000, but an engine timing failure can do much more damage and cost you several thousand dollars to repair.\n\nWhich one should you get?\n\nEvery vehicle has either a timing belt or timing chain specified as the OEM part, and you should always replace your chain or belt with the equivalent part. All the pulleys and gear sets that make up the timing system in your car will be set up for either a chain or a belt and it\u2019s not advisable, or even possible, to swap them out.\n\nCan I do this repair myself?\n\nCars are all put together by people just like you, and you can do all kinds of work on your vehicle as long as you take your time and follow repair guidelines precisely.\n\nOne very important step when replacing a timing belt is to carefully mark the position of the crankshaft pulley and the camshaft pulleys before you remove the original belt. You may also need to use a special tool to hold the camshafts in place.\nIf you are wary of doing this slightly-complicated repair yourself, check AutoZone\u2019s list of Preferred Shops in your area and rely on trusted professionals to make the repair.",

        "title": "What is a Timing Belt, and What Does It Do?",
        "content": "What Is the Purpose of a Timing Belt?\n\nYour timing belt coordinates the combustion cycle of the engine by connecting the crankshaft and the camshaft. The crankshaft rotates with the movement of the pistons and the camshaft controls the movement of the intake and exhaust valves.\nEach cylinder has intake valves that open to allow air and fuel into the combustion chamber. Once the proper amount of air and fuel has entered the chamber, the camshaft closes the valves and the piston moves up in the cylinder, compressing the fuel/air mixture. The spark plug then ignites the mixture and it explodes, forcing the piston to move to back down the cylinder and rotating the crankshaft. At that point, the camshaft causes the exhaust valve to open, allowing the exhaust gases produced in the explosion to exit the cylinder, and the process starts over again.\nAll the valves and the piston need to move in a carefully coordinated dance for the process to work effectively, without blowing up the engine. The rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted through the timing belt to move the camshaft.\n\nWhat a Timing Belt is Made Of\n\nModern timing belts are constructed of rubber, synthetic rubbers like neoprene, polyurethane, or highly saturated nitrile, with high-tensile strength reinforcing cords made of Kevlar, polyester, or fibreglass. The reinforcing cords will run the length of the belt, to reduce the tendency of the belt to stretch out over time. Timing belts have trapezoidal or curvilinear teeth cut into one of the sides and these teeth are specially shaped and sized to connect properly with the pulleys on the crankshaft and the camshaft.\u00a0\u00a0\nEngines with timing chains will have oil flowing over the chain to lubricate and protect the parts. Oil can damage rubber, so engines with rubber timing belts will typically be constructed in a \u201cdry\u201d setup, where oil or coolant does not interact with the belt.\n\nWhat Problems Does a Bad Timing Belt Cause?\n\nMost modern engines are assembled so that the valves and the pistons occupy the same area in the cylinder during different parts of the combustion cycle. They are called interference engines. While this might seem like a bad idea because it could lead to the two parts colliding, it\u2019s actually done in the name of efficiency and power, because the reduced volume of the cylinder allows for higher compression.\nOlder vehicles that used non-interference engines could often survive a broken timing belt without too much damage, but that\u2019s not the case for modern interference engines. Because the valves and the pistons in modern engines need to share the same space in the cylinder, if the timing belt breaks, it will cause the camshaft to stop opening the valves in proper sequence and the pistons can collide with them, causing major damage to the engine.\nIf this happens, the cost to repair the engine can often be extensive, or even prohibitive, causing an owner to either replace the engine or purchase a new vehicle altogether.\n\nHow Long a Timing Belt Lasts\n\nMany experts will suggest that a timing belt should be replaced after 60,000 to 100,000 miles of driving, or seven to 10 years of service. The best bet for any vehicle owner, though, is to follow the recommendations of the manufacturer. Every vehicle manufacturer will lay out a service interval for the timing belt in the service manual of the vehicle, and it is essential to follow that interval to avoid a costly and inconvenient timing belt failure.\n\nCan I Drive with a Bad Timing Belt?\n\n\u00a0If you are aware that you have an issue with your timing belt, you should have it replaced immediately. If your timing belt fails while you are driving, it could cause so much engine damage that it would require either a major rebuild of the engine or an outright engine replacement. While there are many vehicle maintenance tasks that can be deferred, a timing belt replacement is not one of them.\n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Replace a Timing Belt?\n\nThe cost of a timing belt can be quite low, but the labor involved in a timing belt replacement can add up. The timing belt is an internal engine part that requires the mechanic to remove multiple external engine parts in order to access and replace it. Depending on the make and model of vehicle, the cost of a timing belt replacement will start in the several hundred dollars range and can move into four figures.\nThe alternative though is a gamble because if your timing belt fails while driving, the repair costs will be double, triple or more in the end.\n\nShould I Replace Other Parts at the Same Time?\n\nThe timing system in most vehicles with a timing belt includes the crankshaft and camshaft pulleys, a tensioner pulley, and often some idler pulleys. When replacing your timing belt, it is prudent to check the condition of your crankshaft and camshaft pulleys for wear. You should also replace the tensioner pulley and any idler pulleys in the system because the cost of those parts and a small additional labor cost will be insignificant, compared to the cost and labor involved in the entire repair.\nMany engines have a water pump that is driven by the timing belt, and it\u2019s a good practice that while the belt is off and the engine is torn down, to replace the water pump as well. All of these parts can often be found in what\u2019s referred to as a \u201ctiming belt kit\u201d which will contain the belt, all necessary pulleys and tensioners that operate the belt, and many times the water pump as well.\nReplacing a timing belt is a challenging project, but if you do decide to tackle it on your own, be sure to consult with shop manuals and seek out information from experts before you start. The position of the crankshaft and camshaft pulleys need to be very accurately maintained in order for the engine to function properly.\n\nTiming belt replacement is a often a labor-intensive job, so if you need help, seek out our list of Preferred Shops in your area that can help!",

        "title": "Timing Belt Replacement Costs and When to Replace",
        "content": "What a Timing Belt Does\n\nIf\u00a0you have\u00a0heard of the term \u201cTiming Chain\u201d before, both a timing belt and chain perform the same duty. Their job is to keep the mechanical timing of the engine\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the intake and exhaust valves\u00a0opening and closing\u00a0at the\u00a0exact precise time\u00a0needed. Today\u2019s engines are composed of multiple valves per cylinder, sometimes as many as 5 \u2013 and doing this properly requires exact precision between the moving pistons and the opening of\u00a0the\u00a0valves.\nThe timing belt\u00a0(or chain)\u00a0is located toward\u00a0the front of the motor beneath the timing cover. The belt is made with high-quality rubber and reinforced with nylon chords. This belt is under precise tension, and as the engine\u2019s crank turns, it then turns the camshafts (and many times, the water pump) to keep everything in perfect timing.\nIf a timing belt is not set up properly,\u00a0\u201cjumps time\u201d,\u00a0or worse yet\u00a0\u2013\u00a0breaks,\u00a0that\u00a0functioning\u00a0will cause the valves to\u00a0be open at the wrong time. Because most engines are made with zero clearance between the piston top and the valves, this then causes in many cases the piston to collide with one or more valves in the cylinder head, causing bent valves and major damage.\nHow Much Does It Cost to Replace a Timing Belt\n\nA timing belt service is more than just the belt itself. While traditionally, everyone thinks of this change\u00a0as \u201cjust the belt,\u201d\u00a0it is\u00a0not. A timing belt is tensioned and held in the proper track by a series of tensioners and\u00a0idler\u00a0pulleys, all of which have bearings and the ability\u00a0to fail. Likewise, many vehicles have a water pump that is driven by the timing belt. In these cases, it makes complete sense to change the water pump with a new unit at the same time, since the labor to expose the pump is being completed\u00a0anyway.\nThere is nothing worse than paying for a timing belt service, declining the water pump replacement for an\u00a0additional\u00a0$100, only to find out 6 months later that the water pump is leaking, and now everything must be replaced again.\nIn most cases, a timing belt kit will consist of the belt itself, 2-3\u00a0idler\u00a0pulleys, and a tensioner. When the job is done,\u00a0all\u00a0these components will be changed out. In most cases, a timing belt kit will run between $100 -350. \nLabor on most timing belts is between 3-5 hours, putting your total cost between $400 -1,000. Remember,\u00a0do not\u00a0opt for a \u201cjust the belt\u201d replacement. While the cost is cheaper, the chances of further failure\u00a0increase\u00a0significantly.\u00a0If the water pump is being done at the same time, the labor should be minimal, and less than 1 hour, as the work to expose the water pump and remove the timing belt is being done\u00a0anyway.\nIf you decide to do the job yourself, make sure you follow each step of removal and reassembly perfectly, and research as much as possible on the job. Many timing belt jobs require the camshafts to be held\u00a0in place by a special tool \u2013\u00a0do not\u00a0let this scare you. While these tools are readily available, many of them are vehicle specific, so there can be a multitude of them. Many other tricks are shown online on how to keep the camshafts properly in place when installing the new belt, and many more\u00a0do not\u00a0require\u00a0any tools for this at all. \nRemember that once the new belt is in place and properly tensioned, always rotate the\u00a0engine slowly by hand, checking and double-checking the belt alignment and make sure everything looks proper. If any resistance is\u00a0encountered, stop! Recheck the alignment.\nRemember, if your timing belt breaks, the damage is much, much worse. At this point, the cylinder head must be removed, valves replaced, or new remanufactured heads installed.\u00a0This takes that timing belt job from $400 -1,000 and just raised it to $3,000 -5,000. In many cases, repairing a timing belt breakage is so expensive it is more than the value of the vehicle.\n\nWhen to Replace Your Timing Belt\n\nAs\u00a0stated\u00a0before, timing belts are composed of rubber, no different than a regular drive serpentine belt. Over years and constant heat cycling, the rubber begins to degrade, to the point where the belt finally fails.\u00a0In most cases, a\u00a0faulty timing belt\u00a0will\u00a0provide\u00a0no warning of an impending break. You will be driving along, when suddenly the car dies.\u00a0\nBecause of severity of a belt breaking, every vehicle equipped with a timing belt will have a manufacturers recommendation on when to change the timing belt. These intervals are usually somewhere between 70,000 miles and 90,000.\u00a0You can find recommendations specific to your vehicle by checking with the owner\u2019s manual that came with your\u00a0car or\u00a0researching online. \nAnother thing to consider is that miles are only a general indicator, older, low mileage vehicles should always be considered for a timing belt change because\u00a0usage\u00a0is not\u00a0the only thing that degrades the rubber \u2013 time will as well. For example, you own a 2016\u00a0vehicle with 60,000 miles on it, and its timing belt recommendation is 70,000 miles. At this point,\u00a0it is\u00a0time to start planning your timing belt service. In\u00a0contrast, you own a 2001 vehicle\u00a0that has\u00a0been minimally driven, only has 40,000 miles, but there is no evidence of a timing belt ever being replaced. Because this belt is over 20 years old,\u00a0it is\u00a0prime for replacement. Either way, this is one maintenance item you absolutely want to plan for, and do not want to neglect.\n\nCan You Tell When the Timing Belt is Going Bad?\n\nUnfortunately, timing belts rarely give any warning of impending doom. While there are other things that can\u00a0speed\u00a0up a timing belt\u2019s\u00a0decay, like oil\u00a0or antifreeze\u00a0leaking into the timing belt area (and often seen as an oil leak\u00a0or water pump leak), in most cases, the belt is simply old, brittle, and breaks.\nMost timing belt covers\u00a0are plastic and\u00a0have one or several inspection plugs, or ports, where you\u00a0can\u00a0quickly\u00a0remove and\u00a0look\u00a0at\u00a0a small\u00a0portion\u00a0of\u00a0the timing belt. One of the first things to inspect is cracks on the belt. Rubber as you know\u00a0will\u00a0crack and chip as it gets older, and any evidence of cracks on the belt should\u00a0immediately\u00a0raise a red flag for a belt change.\nAnother thing to consider is service records.\u00a0Whenever buying a used car\u00a0that is\u00a0equipped with a timing belt, always ask about timing belt service.\u00a0When\u00a0was\u00a0the last time it was performed, if ever?\u00a0Does the owner have documentation in the form of receipts or\u00a0invoice?\u00a0Has the vehicle been to the dealer? Keep in mind, calling the dealer and asking for service records may lead to clues on when the belt\u00a0was\u00a0last changed, or if it was at all.\u00a0Finally, when in doubt, change the belt!\n\nWhat to Do Next",

        "title": "Bad Power Steering Pump: Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Before diving into the specifics of the power steering pump replacement, it is necessary to understand the equipment, symptoms, and safety concerns. As an integral steering component, it is unwise to drive with a failing pump, but how do you know when it is time to replace the part? Also, are you only going to need to replace this part once in the lifetime of your vehicle? The power steering pump is an intricate engine component, and while you may not be able to identify it now, by the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the purpose of this part and when to replace it. Also, you will understand how the cost of a replacement is broken down, and whether you can save money or not.\n\nUnderstanding the Power Steering Pump\n\nWhat is a power steering pump? Most classic cars did not have power steering, which meant they were harder to turn and control. As steering systems evolved, engineers found ways to ease the steering process using hydraulics. The power steering pump is a critical component of the hydraulic system. The pump circulates and pressurizes power steering fluid. When the pressurized fluid is transferred through a hose to the steering pump, it is used to help turn the wheel. As the wheel turns, another hose returns the fluid back through the pump, where it is pressurized again. The process is continuous while the engine is running, meaning that you are never left without steering assistance. Since most drivers own vehicles equipped with power steering, it quickly becomes obvious when the pump is failing because of\u00a0power steering problems like a hard to turn wheel.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad Power Steering Pump\n\n1. Fluid Leaks\n\nOne of the most common signs of pump failure is a fluid leak. Power steering fluid is a red or reddish-brown color. Check for puddles after driving. While a leak is not a definitive sign of a bad pump, it does signal that there is something wrong with the system.\n\n2. Noises\n\nNext, you may hear the power steering pump making strange noises. If you hear groaning, whining or screeching noises when you turn the wheel or increase engine RPMs, then your power steering pump may be going bad. The pump is driven by a belt, which also can result in strange sounds, so check your belt as well.\n\n3. Hard to Turn Steering Wheel\n\nFinally, as the pump goes bad, you will notice an increased difficulty when turning your car. You will likely struggle the most when going slow or stopped.\n\nSafety and Caution\n\nIf you hear a power steering pump noise or suspect an issue with the system, it is best to have your vehicle towed to a safe location, like your garage or a repair shop. While it is technically safe to drive a car with a leaking power steering pump, you must keep in mind the risk of doing so. If the leak is faster than you expect, then you risk damaging the power steering system. Permanent damage is a risk, which is why it is better to err on the side of caution. Do not drive a vehicle you think has a pump issue. Call for a tow. It is always better to be safe than sorry. While it is best to repair the problem quickly, you may be able to save a few bucks doing the repair yourself, but only if you have the skill set.\n\nCost of Replacement\n\nIt is difficult to specify an exact cost because the price of a replacement part varies based on vehicle make and model. The estimate for the entire pump replacement is $100 to $200 for parts. If you are handy, then you may be able to save around $300, which is a likely cost for labor. Again, these estimates are rough because even labor costs can vary from place to place. While it is tempting to save some money and do the job yourself, keep in mind that a pump repair is likely part of a larger project, requiring a more advanced skill set. You may be able to find a cheaper part and then pay someone to install it, but that depends on the shop.\n\nFrequency of Replacement\n\nMost vehicle components have an expected lifespan, and power steering pumps are no different. A pump typically lasts up to 100,000 miles or better before experiencing any significant issues. However, much of that longevity has to do with maintaining a proper maintenance schedule.\nBecause steering pumps last so long, any repair work is usually found in used vehicles, especially because of how many car owners lease. Although, that does not mean that a younger model won\u2019t experience unexpected failure or problems. Always be mindful of the symptoms and signs of a failing pump, so you can avoid significant harm to your car\u2019s steering system.",

        "title": "What is the Starting and Charging System?",
        "content": "How Vehicle Starting and Charging Works\n\n1. The battery supplies power to your vehicle\n\nThe starting battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The three essential parts for this conversion are the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte.\n\nThe anode is the negatively-charged side of the battery\nThe cathode is the positively-charged side\nThe electrolyte is a buffer that separates the anode and cathode\n\nChemical reactions inside of the battery cause electrons to build up in the anode. Like with magnets, the similarly charged particles repel one another, but in a battery the electrolyte blocks these particles from merely switching sides by moving over to the opposite side.\n\n2. Battery cables and terminals carry current from the battery\n\nBattery cables connect the battery\u2019s terminals to the vehicle. One end of each cable is connected to either the negative or positive terminal.\n\nThe other end of the negative cable is often connected to the engine or somewhere on the vehicle\u2019s frame\nThe positive cable\u2019s other end is typically connected to the starter or a fuse box\n\nBecause the electrolyte keeps the charged particles from crossing the battery, electrical current moves from the battery, through the cables, and into the vehicle.\nCorrosion and loose connections can keep your cables from working the way they should. Be sure to inspect your cables for looseness or corrosion from time to time. If you have a problem, it\u2019s easy to tighten the cables or to remove corrosion with a wire brush.\n\n3. Relays, fuses, and the starter receive electrical current\n\nThe moment you turn the key to start in your car (or push the button) a signal is sent to a relay, or series of relays. The main relay in this group is referred to as the starter solenoid. The signal, coming from the ignition, is low amperage. When it hits these relays, and the starter solenoid, this engages a high-amperage current which directly engages the starter.\nYour vehicle\u2019s relays and fuses regulate current in the electrical systems.\n\nA relay is basically a switch that allows small currents to control accessories that would require heavy switches and wiring. Relays reduce the amount of wiring needed by having larger contact areas that can handle large amounts of current. The starter solenoid is generally one of the largest relays in your car because it handles such a huge amperage amount.\nMany vehicles have fuses in-line in their ignition system as well or a main battery or system fuse. These are often seen mounted either directly on the battery cable, or nearby in the engine\u2019s fuse/relay compartment.\nFuses protect your vehicle\u2019s electronic devices and wiring. If something like, say, your radio tries to draw too much current, the radio\u2019s fuse will blow, cutting off the current\u2019s path to the radio. This prevents the excess current from damaging the radio or melting wires in the system.\n\nAfter reaching the relays and fuses, current continues to the vehicle\u2019s various electrical systems.\n\n4. The starter turns the engine\n\nWhen the starter solenoid engages, the starter\u2019s gear, or \u201cbendix\u201d moves out to engage the flywheel or flexplate of the engine, turning it over. The turning of the engine allows the fuel air-mixture to enter into the engine cylinders for combustion, starting the engine.\nA clicking noise when you turn the key is a good indicator of low battery voltage that is sufficient enough to engage the relays, but not enough to turn the motor. Often times, you will hear a buzzing sound. This sound is your starter solenoid not fully engaging because of low or insufficient voltage. Or, in some cases, a click indicates that your starter has gone bad. In these cases, a visual inspection and/or removal and bench testing is needed, which AutoZone provides. If the starter is soaked with oil contamination and requires replacement, be sure the oil leak is repaired to prevent damage to the replacement starter.\n\n5. The accessory belt or serpentine belt drives the alternator\n\nOnce the engine is turning, rotational force from the crankshaft turns the belt pulley. The belt transfers this rotational force to other systems, like the power steering pump, the water pump, and most importantly for this article: the alternator.\n\n6. The alternator recharges the battery\n\nThe alternator is responsible for 2 things at the same time. It supplies voltage power to everything your car uses while it is running. While doing this, it also sends charge to the battery to maintain its charge as well, and in doing so, the battery acts as a capacitor. An alternator works no different than a windmill or turbine, generating AC power, which is then converted to DC power inside the alternator. The 3 items responsible for this inside the alternator are the rotor, stator, and rectifier. The alternator works similarly, except it is turned by the belt rather than a hand or the wind. The two components responsible for generating electricity are the rotor and the stator:\n\nThe rotor features magnetized finger poles that rotate surrounding the wire field winding. Each finger pole is a different length to produce alternating north and south poles for the winding.\nThe stator is just enough larger that the rotor can spin without touching the stator walls.\nA rectifier is in a sense a valve. It converts AC power (Alternating Current) into DC power (direct current).\n\nThe spinning magnetized poles generate current in the winding, and this current provides the power that charges your battery. Inside your alternator, a voltage regulator makes sure that this voltage is maintained at a proper level for your car\u2019s electrical system. This is usually somewhere between 14-16 volts.\nTest your alternator using an alternator/battery tester or voltmeter (Learn how to test an alternator here). Ensure the drive belt is in good condition and does not slip on the alternator pulley. A dead battery, one that won\u2019t stay charged, or headlamps and interior lights that appear dim can indicate that your alternator is possibly bad. Visually inspect your alternator for signs of the problem. If the alternator is replaced, be sure the battery is fully charged before starting the engine. This will prevent overload and potential damage to the replacement alternator. If the drive belt shows signs of wear, replace it to ensure the alternator will perform properly. If equipped with an automatic belt tensioner, inspect it for wear and binding/sticking. If it does not move smoothly it should be replaced along with the belt.\n\nRemember that AutoZone can help with any of your Battery, Alternator, or charging system needs through replacement parts or testing.

        "title": "How to Replace a Serpentine Belt",
        "content": "What is a Serpentine Belt?\n\nThe serpentine belt is aptly named for the way it snakes around the pulleys inside the engine bay. This long, winding rubber belt powers many of the important systems of your vehicle by transferring power from the engine\u2019s crankshaft to the accessory pulleys. These pulleys rotate to power components like the alternator, power steering pump, and air conditioner. In some cars, it even powers the water pump in the cooling system.\n\nHow to Replace Your Serpentine Belt\n\n1. Note the placement of belt\n\nSerpentine belts have that name for a reason. They snake in and out of a series of pulleys and peripherals, and the path they weave through is unique to your model vehicle. To preserve the belt\u2019s position, take a few snapshots from different angles or sketch the way it winds through the engine. If the belt is already out of place, locate the driver\u2019s manual or the under-the-hood placard, where you\u2019ll find a sketch of the routing.\n\n2. Loosen and unthread the belt\n\nBefore removing the belt, you\u2019ll need to release the tensioner, which automatically keeps the belt taut while you\u2019re driving. Tensioners usually have one of two ways to release tension. Many have a \u00bd\u201d square cast into the tensioner arm, in which you insert a \u00bd\u201d breaker bar, or Belt Tensioner Tool to relieve the tension. Many others, you use a socket on the pulley itself to do this. Use a ratchet or breaker bar that fits into the bolt and release the tensioner. Then unroute the belt carefully, taking care not to disturb or damage the network of pulleys and peripherals.\n\n3. Check for damage\n\nAfter removing the belt, inspect it for signs of damage. Many belts wear out over time, but some wear down due to misalignment or other issues. Misalignment won\u2019t resolve itself when you replace the belt, so determine whether this is a problem. Look for disintegration along the edges and separated ribs, both of which are signs that you have misalignment on your hands. Use a straightedge to make sure the pulleys are aligned correctly, and then remove any old dirt and grime from the pulleys. This is a good time to look for oil leaks, too. Oil can increase wear on serpentine belts. Most importantly, take the tensioner pulley and any idler pulleys (these are pulleys that do not drive anything, like Power Steering) and give them a spin. Listen carefully. They should spin freely and make no noise. Grab each pulley and check for any side to side, or in and out movement. Any excessive movement of any of these pulleys, or noise, and they should be replaced. If these pulleys fail while on the vehicle, your belt will fall off, and you will be running without a water pump (in most cases), power steering, and an alternator, so check them carefully!\n\n4. Install the new belt\n\nWhy is My Engine Squealing?\n\nIn all likelihood, it\u2019s probably not your engine that\u2019s responsible for all the racket. Squealing from the engine bay probably comes from a worn out belt. It could be a drive belt or serpentine belt. When rubber belts start to wear out, they slip and slide. This makes a squeaking or squealing sound. Ever notice how your tires screech and squeal when they lose grip? It\u2019s the same thing with your car\u2019s belts. When you hear this sound, you\u2019ll want to get the belt replaced immediately. If the belt is worn enough to slip, it\u2019s going to start wearing out faster. If it breaks, the broken belt could flip around in the engine compartment and potentially cause major damage to your vehicle.\n\nWhat Happens When the Serpentine Belt Goes Bad?\n\nSerpentine belts don\u2019t need to be replaced particularly often. Most last for around 50,000 to 100,000 miles. Consult your owner\u2019s manual maintenance section for replacement intervals. When you notice one of these four signs, it\u2019s time for a new serpentine belt: Serpentine belt transfer power from the engine\u2019s crank shaft to the engines alternator, power steering pump, smog pump*, and air conditioner compressor. This one belt provides power to all the vehicles components. Some vehicles have a dedicated belt for the alternator just in case the serpentine belt should break. The vehicle can continue driving until it reaches a safe place to stop.\n\nSquealing from power steering or air conditioning:\u00a0The serpentine belt controls peripherals such as power steering and air conditioning, and these devices take a lot of torque from the belt to turn, so if you turn the wheel, or turn on the AC and hear squealing, the chances are, your belt has worn.\nWear and tear:\u00a0If a visual inspection of the serpentine belt reveals significant wear and tear, including cracks, separation, or damage, it\u2019s time for a new belt.\nSquealing noise under the hood:\u00a0This may signal that the belt is slipping. Sometimes a new belt is not needed. The belt is kept tight through the belt tensioner. The tensioner is a self-adjusting pulley that maintains pressure on the belt to reduce slipping. At times, the bearings in the tensioner pulley become worn. This causes the squealing noise. Check these bearings when performing a belt change.\n\n*if equipped\n\nHow Long Do Serpentine Belts Last?\n\nSerpentine belts can last for years and might only need to be changed once or twice over the life of the vehicle. The recommended industry standard is to inspect your belt at 60,000 miles for wear & tear and replace if necessary, and\u00a0replace every 90,000 miles\u00a0regardless of the appearance in order to reduce the chances of a breakdown.\nLike anything else in your vehicle, it is not indestructible and will eventually falter. If you keep your car long enough, or if it\u2019s an older model, be prepared to replace it as belts will succumb to heat and friction over time. The best way to determine when yours should be replaced is to check your owner\u2019s manual for the service interval.\n\nWhat Does a Worn Belt Look Like?\n\nWear and tear, as well as extreme temperatures, will take a toll on the serpentine belt at some point. Years of use could cause the belt to crack or wear unevenly. It\u2019s a good idea to periodically check the belt or have a mechanic inspect it for you during routine car maintenance. Keep in mind that serpentine belts don\u2019t show cracks like their predecessors. Newer belts wear more like tires, so you\u2019ll need to look for rib material deterioration. Other signs of problems are damaged ribs or rib separation. Your mechanic can let you know when to replace the serpentine belt or how many miles it has left.\n\nLook on the inside of the belt (the ribbed side that touches the pulleys on the alternator, water pumps, and other engine accessories). If you notice the ribs cracking, the ribs are worn away, or you notice any other substantial belt wear, it\u2019s time to change the belt.\nIf you have a recurring issue where your belt frequently breaks, or it breaks long before it should have, it is possible that an issue like pulley drag, obstruction or debris in the engine bay, or contamination of the belt and pulley from leaking oil or coolant.\n\nListen for Clues\n\nYou may not have to lift the hood and look for visible evidence of a worn-out serpentine belt. Sometimes, your ears can be your ally. Like many other parts and components on your vehicle, when the serpentine belt nears the end of its life, you may start to hear strange noises. Belt problems aren\u2019t limited to wearing out, breaking, or contamination of the pulleys and belt. Some may slip, causing significant problems with your vehicle. When this happens, you may hear a chirping or squealing sound. This could also indicate that the belt has stretched out and that there is a tension issue. The pulley system that operates the mechanism of the belt may also be failing.\n\nWhat Happens When the Belt Breaks?\n\nIf you\u2019re like many other drivers, you\u2019ve probably driven farther than you should when parts or systems are going out. With some components, you can get away with keeping your car on the road for a little while. However, if your serpentine belt breaks completely or falls off, you won\u2019t have any option but to replace it.\nWhen your belt fails, everything that it is driving stops functioning. In most cases, this is the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. Usually the first one you feel is a lack of power steering. Your battery light will also illuminate, as your alternator has stopped working. Lastly, your engines temperature will very quickly rise, as your water pump has stopped working. It is extremely important to understand that the moment you have seen any of these symptoms, pull over immediately! Quickly get your vehicle into a parking space away from congestion if you are not on the highway. If you determine that your belt has broken, you cannot continue to drive the vehicle. The vehicle will overheat within a matter of minutes, and at that point, you risk the possibility of warped heads, blown head gaskets, and damage that is far, far worse than a tow bill.\n\nThe Cost of Replacing the Belt\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a bad serpentine belt, don\u2019t hesitate to get a new one. This will give you the peace of mind you need to get back on the road safely. Just think, the next time you purchase a belt may be the last time you\u2019ll ever have to do so on that vehicle. More good news: serpentine belts are inexpensive compared to other car parts and components. A professional mechanic will normally charge between $75 and $120 in labor to remove the old belt and replace it with a new one. If you\u2019re thinking about doing this work yourself, make sure you understand the process. You don\u2019t want to drive around with an incorrectly installed serpentine belt. If you need help changing the belt,\u00a0search through our list of local Preferred Shops in your area.\nWhen you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat of your vehicle, you probably don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about the serpentine belt. As you understand more about how this rubber component powers your vehicle, you\u2019ll start to appreciate it more. Keep your eyes and ears out for the signs of a damaged belt so you\u2019ll know when you need to remove it and put on a new one. You can then continue driving safely, and your car\u2019s reliability will improve.

        "title": "Why is My Brake Pedal Hard to Push?",
        "content": "Introduction to Brake Pedal Resistance\n\nInitially, a stiff pedal might be dismissed as an occasional quirk, but when it happens often, it indicates an underlying issue with your vehicle\u2019s hydraulic systems. It\u2019s a signal that your vehicle\u2019s most important safety feature has something wrong. Before you can fix the issue, understanding the symptoms and potential root causes is crucial.\nYour vehicle\u2019s brakes are designed to convert the kinetic energy of its moving wheels into heat energy, safely slowing the vehicle\u2019s forward motion through controlled friction. The brake pedal is your direct line of communication with this process, exerting force through a system of mechanical and hydraulic functions. Travel should always be smooth and consistent, and when it isn\u2019t, it indicates that there\u2019s a problem.\n\nCommon Causes of a Hard Brake Pedal\n\nA hard brake pedal can be as varied in its causes as the potential results of not addressing it. Four of the main culprits are:\n\nHydraulic issues \u2013 Your vehicle\u2019s brakes are part of a hydraulic system that multiplies force, allowing you to stop a heavy car with minimal effort. A stiff pedal can be a sign of pressure restriction within this system, possibly due to a kinked line, a bad proportioning valve, or even a damaged brake master cylinder.\nBrake booster problems \u2013 The brake booster amplifies the force applied to the brake pedal, making braking easier. If the brake booster develops a vacuum leak, which it uses to operate, the result is often a hard brake pedal.\nVacuum leaks \u2013 Many modern brake systems rely on engines to create the vacuum necessary for brake boosters to function. A leak in the vacuum line or the booster diaphragm can occur, causing the system to lose vacuum pressure and the brake pedal to become stiff.\nBrake fluid contamination \u2013 Brake fluid is used to operate the hydraulic portion of your braking system. Over time, moisture can be absorbed into the brake fluid, lowering its boiling point, and potentially leading to a vapor lock that causes brake pedal stiffness.\n\nDiagnosing Brake Pedal Issues\n\nBefore rolling up your sleeves, it\u2019s important to diagnose the exact nature of your brake pedal issue.\n\nStep 1: Check the Brake Fluid Level\n\nLow brake fluid is an easy-to-spot cause for a stiff pedal. Ensuring the reservoir is properly filled can sometimes be the only fix needed. Always use the correct type of fluid for your vehicle from a new, sealed container.\n\nStep 2: Feel the Brake Pedal During Operation\n\nIs the pedal consistently hard, or does its resistance vary with vehicle speed or other conditions? Consistency points to hydraulic or fluid issues, while changes can indicate a booster or vacuum problem.\n\nStep 3: Listen for Hissing Sounds\n\nWith the engine off, pump the brake pedal several times to deplete the booster\u2019s vacuum reserve. If you hear hissing, you may have a vacuum leak.\n\nStep 4: Perform a Visual Inspection\n\nInspect the brake lines and hoses for damage, as well as the vacuum lines leading to the brake booster. Some issues like cracking or rubs can point you toward the necessary repair.\n\nDIY Solutions for a Stiff Brake Pedal\n\nTackling a stiff brake pedal can be a do-it-yourself project for many car owners. Here are some practical solutions to try.\n\nBleeding the Brake System\n\nAir bubbles in the brake lines that can compress and lead to a spongy pedal feel can often be repaired by bleeding the brakes. This flushes out these bubbles, restoring hydraulic function and dependability.\n\nReplacing Brake Booster\n\nIf you\u2019ve verified a vacuum leak is causing your brake stiffness, you may need to replace the brake booster. This involves disconnecting the master cylinder and vacuum lines, installing the new booster, and ensuring a tight seal at each connection.\n\nFixing Vacuum Leaks\n\nLocating the source of a vacuum leak can be challenging as many lines and fittings are tucked out of sight. Common culprits include deteriorated hoses, loose fittings, and failed gaskets. Once you find the problem, it\u2019s often a quick fix of replacement or resealing.\n\nFlush the Brake Fluid\n\nA color change in your brake fluid to murky and brown is a sign of contamination and should be flushed out. Flushing involves removing all the old brake fluid and replacing it , ensuring your system\u2019s fluid is clean, effective, and protecting you\u2019re the inside against corrosion.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nIf you\u2019re running into a wall with your troubleshooting or want the assurance of a pro\u2019s take on the situation, you might want to take it to a trusted garage. Check out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.They can include unusual noises, spotty brake performance, or a pedal that intermittently hardens and softens should prompt an immediate visit to a certified mechanic.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Adjust Drum Brakes",
        "content": "Understanding Drum Brakes\n\nInside the brake drum, you\u2019ll find a few key components:\n\nBrake shoes, which consist of friction material bonded to a metal backing\nThe wheel cylinder, which pushes the shoes against the brake drum when you press the brake pedal\nVarious springs and levers that hold everything in place\nAnd an adjuster\n\nWhen you press the brake pedal, hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder is applied to the wheel cylinder, moving it outward and causing the brake shoes to press against the inner surface of the brake drum, creating the friction necessary to slow or stop your vehicle.\nWorn drum brakes can cause a host of issues, including reduced braking power, squeaking or grinding noises, or a pulling sensation when the brakes are applied. Misaligned brakes can also cause uneven wear on the brake shoes, reducing their lifespan and effectiveness, and contributing to excessive heat from the brakes, a pull to the side, extended stops, or even higher than normal fuel consumption due to the drag.\nProper adjustment is key to ensure that your drum brakes will have the proper stopping power when you need it without having too much drag when you\u2019re not braking.\n\nTools and Materials You\u2019ll Need\n\nTo adjust drum brakes, you\u2019ll need a handful of common items around the garage:\n\nA jack and jack stands\nA lug wrench\nA brake adjusting spoon or screwdriver\nA brake spring tool\n\nInvesting in a good quality set of tools specifically designed for brake work can make the job easier and ensure it\u2019s done safely.\nIn addition to the standard tools, consider purchasing a drum brake adjustment kit. These kits typically include a variety of springs, clips, and other hardware commonly needed during adjustment and maintenance work. Having these parts on hand will speed up the process and ensure you have the necessary components to make the adjustment correctly. An ideal tool to use is the Duralast Brake Spoon that\u2019s designed to fit in tight areas like the access through the backing plate. Its high-strength forged steel is made to withstand the pressure you\u2019ll need to put on it for stuck or corroded adjusters.\nKeep safety a priority by wearing protective equipment including gloves and eye protection when working on your car. In addition, ensure that you have a clean and well-lit workspace to avoid accidents.\n\nStep-by-Step Drum Brake Adjustment\n\nBefore you start, chock the wheels, engage the parking brake, and secure your rear wheels off the ground on jack stands.\n\nStep 1: Loosen the Brakes and Remove the Drum\n\nMost drum brakes can be adjusted without removing the drum itself, but you\u2019ll want to inspect them before making your adjustment. With access to the backing plate, pop the access plug out and keep it for later. Then, remove the brake drum. Loosen the star wheel adjuster with the brake spoon if the brakes are too tight to let the drum slide off.\n\nStep 2: Inspect and Lubricate Components\n\nCheck the condition of the brake shoes, wheel cylinder, and all the hardware. Clean any dust or debris from the components and apply a light coating of high-temperature brake grease to any moving parts such as the star wheel, pivot points, and contact surfaces where the shoes meet the backing plate. Don\u2019t get lubricant directly on the brake friction material or the drum surface. Then install the drum again.\n\nStep 3: Adjust the Brake Shoes\n\nLocate the star wheel adjuster and rotate it with the brake spoon or large screwdriver. If it hasn\u2019t been adjusted in awhile, it might be tough to start moving it. Typically, the brakes are loose rather than tight, so turn the adjuster while spinning the wheel or drum until you notice it getting a little tighter. The shoes should lightly touch the inside of the drum when you rotate the drum by hand, but there should be no significant drag.\n\nCommon Issues and Troubleshooting\n\nYou can run into issues as you adjust the brakes. For example:\n\nIf you notice that one brake shoe is more worn than the other, this usually indicates a hardware or adjustment issue. Check that all hardware is in good condition, and adjust the brakes properly. Be meticulous about cleaning and lubricating all components to ensure even function and wear.\nNoises like squeaking and squealing can be indicators of a few issues such as worn shoes, glazed drum surfaces, or debris or moisture inside the drum. Proper adjustment and maintenance can often solve these problems, but if they persist, inspect the brakes further for more severe issues.\nThe emergency brake, or parking brake, is often part of the drum brake system. Adjusting it is similar to adjusting the main brakes but requires additional steps that vary by model.\nIf your drum brakes do not respond well when pressed, there may be an underlying hydraulic issue, such as air in the lines or a failing wheel cylinder. Inspect for leaks and replace parts as necessary.\n\nMaintenance Schedule for Drum Brakes\n\nThe frequency with which you need to adjust your drum brakes can vary depending on your driving habits and the type of driving you do. A good rule of thumb is to check them every 12,000 miles or annually, whichever comes first.\nWhile adjusting your drum brakes, it\u2019s a good time to inspect other components such as the brake fluid level, the condition of hoses, and any visible signs of brake line corrosion. These can all affect brake performance, and if something goes wrong, it could be a serious safety issue, so don\u2019t put it off.\nIf you\u2019re uncomfortable or unsure about adjusting your drum brakes, you might want to have a knowledgeable friend assist you or seek professional help. Brake systems are important for safety, and mistakes during adjustment or repair can have serious consequences.\nTo make your drum brakes last longer between adjustments, practice smooth and conservative braking, and avoid riding the brakes. Also, keep an eye (or ear) out for any signs of trouble and address them promptly to prevent more significant issues down the line.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Brake Pads vs Brake Shoes",
        "content": "Introduction to Brake Components\n\nResponsible for slowing down and stopping your car, the braking system consists of various parts. They differ based on the system design. For disc brake systems, you\u2019ll find:\n\nCalipers \u2013 the clamp that holds brake pads\nBrake pads \u2013 the friction material integral to stopping your vehicle\nBrake rotors \u2013 the hard surface that brake pads squeeze against\nBrake hoses \u2013 carry fluid to force the caliper to close\nCaliper bracket \u2013 fastens the caliper to the wheel knuckle\n\nFor drum brake systems, there are parts that perform similar functions:\n\nWheel cylinders \u2013 force the shoes to press against the drum\nBrake shoes \u2013 the friction material that slows your car\nBrake drum \u2013 the hard, rotating hat-like part that\u2019s similar to a rotor\nBrake hose \u2013 moves fluid, causing the wheel cylinder to apply brake pressure\n\nIn these systems, brake pads and brake shoes stand out as key players. While they share the common goal of slowing down your car, their designs, applications, and performance characteristics differ significantly. Let\u2019s delve into the specifics of each to help you make an informed decision about which is best suited for your needs.\n\nBrake Pads Explained\n\nBrake pads are composed of a friction material bonded to a metal backing plate. The friction material is a crucial element as it directly interacts with the brake rotor during the braking process. Common friction materials include organic compounds, semi-metallic, and ceramic. The metal backing plate provides structural support and helps dissipate heat generated during braking.\nBrake pads function by creating friction against the brake rotor when the brake pedal is pressed. This friction generates heat and slows down the rotation of the rotor, ultimately bringing the vehicle to a stop. The efficiency is influenced by factors such as the quality of the friction material, design, and the type of driving conditions they are subjected to.\nBrake pads are commonly used in modern cars for their superior stopping power and responsiveness. They perform well under various driving conditions, offering consistent performance and durability. Ceramic brake pads, for example, are well known for their low noise, reduced dust production, and excellent heat dissipation properties. However, they may come at a higher cost compared to organic or semi-metallic options.\n\nBrake Shoes Demystified\n\nBrake shoes are used in drum brake systems, which are commonly found in the rear wheels of many vehicles. Brake shoes consist of a curved metal shoe lined with friction material on the outside. When the brake pedal is pressed, the brake shoes press against the interior surface of the brake drum, creating the friction necessary to slow down the vehicle.\nDrum brake systems, where brake shoes are prevalent, are known for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. While they may not offer the same level of performance as disc brake systems in terms of cooling and stopping power, drum brakes remain a reliable and widely used solution in various vehicle models for the rear wheels where less stopping power is required.\nBrake shoes have their advantages and disadvantages compared to brake pads. They are generally more durable and can withstand heavy use over extended periods. However, they may not dissipate heat as efficiently as disc brakes, potentially leading to reduced performance during prolonged or intense braking scenarios.\n\nChoosing Between Brake Pads and Brake Shoes\n\nSeveral factors should be considered when choosing between brake pads and brake shoes. The type of braking system your vehicle employs, your driving habits, and the intended use of your vehicle all play a role in the decision-making process. First and foremost, though, is the fact that you can\u2019t fit brake shoes on a disc brake system, and similarly, you can\u2019t fit brake pads on a drum brake setup.\nCertain vehicles come equipped with either disc brakes on all wheels, a combination of disc and drum brakes, or drum brakes exclusively on the rear wheels. Regardless of how your vehicle is designed, you\u2019ll need to use parts that fit your vehicle specifically, otherwise, they either won\u2019t fit at all or won\u2019t perform properly.\nIf you prioritize high-performance braking, especially in demanding driving conditions, disc brake systems that have brake pads are generally preferred. They offer superior stopping power and are more effective at dissipating heat. On the other hand, if you prioritize durability and simplicity, a vehicle with drum brakes may be the suitable option for your needs.\n\nMaintenance and Replacement Tips\n\nRegular inspection of your vehicle\u2019s braking components is crucial for early detection of wear and tear. Common signs of worn brake pads include:\n\nSqueaking or grinding noises\nReduced braking efficiency\nLonger stopping distances\nPad or shoe thickness below \u00bc inch\nScoring or glazing\n\nMaintaining your vehicle\u2019s braking system involves routine inspections, brake fluid checks, and following manufacturer-recommended maintenance schedules. Regular cleaning and lubrication of brake components contribute to the longevity and performance of both brake pads and brake shoes.\nWhile replacement intervals vary depending on driving conditions, a general guideline is to replace brake pads every 30,000 to 70,000 miles, and brake shoes every 40,000 to 80,000 miles. However, it\u2019s essential to follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and address any signs of wear. Replacing brake components involves removing the wheels, calipers, and rotors or drums, making it a task suited for any level of DIYer.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Is Brake Fluid Leaking from the Caliper?",
        "content": "Understanding Brake Fluid Leaks\n\nAs brake fluid is forced into the caliper when you apply pressure to the pedal, the hydraulic pressure moves the piston or pistons outward. The brake caliper squeezes the brake pads against the brake rotor, and the resulting friction decelerates your car. But keeping the fluid contained within the high-pressure environment of the caliper is crucial, otherwise the brakes don\u2019t work properly. Over years of pressure, use, and exposure to environmental elements, seals can deteriorate and allow leaks.\nAt the first sign of a caliper leak, it needs to be dealt with decisively. When fluid escapes from the caliper, there isn\u2019t enough braking pressure at that wheel, especially for sudden stops or hard applications. It can contribute to an accident, and it\u2019s not safe to drive your car until it\u2019s fixed.\n\nDetecting Brake Fluid Leaks\n\nFinding and addressing brake fluid leaks begins with identifying any symptoms that start to occur. What you notice will often depend on the severity of the leak but can include:\n\nBrake fluid visible on the affected wheel\nThe brake pedal sinks slowly to the floor while pressed\nPulling to one side when you apply the brakes\nThe brake pads are wearing unevenly\nSquealing noise when brakes are applied\nBrake light on the dashboard\n\nAs a DIYer, there are a few ways you can help identify a leaking brake caliper on your own. The first, as already mentioned, is to look for an oily fluid on one of the wheels. Another is to check between the wheel spokes, looking for wetness on the caliper and hub. As well, look for any grime building up on the caliper where the brake caliper piston seal is as well as where the hose connects. Any fluid or buildup in these places can indicate a fluid leak. Have a friend press the brake pedal while you inspect as the pressure can help make it clear where the fluid is coming from.\n\nCommon Causes of Caliper Leaks\n\nAs a rather simple design \u2013 a glorified clamp \u2013 the caliper doesn\u2019t have many points of failure to worry about. Common cause of caliper leaks are:\n\nCaliper seals that fail due to routine wear and tear.\nPiston seals that tear from being overextended, typically when brake pads are completely worn out.\nCorrosion and rust that form in the caliper from oversaturated brake fluid.\nPoor seal at the brake hose connection.\nA broken bleeder screw.\n\nAddressing Brake Fluid Leaks\n\nIn some cases, the correction for a caliper leak may be minor. A brake hose that\u2019s slightly loose might be able to be tightened, for example. But in most cases, the caliper will need to be removed for the repair.\nFor DIYers, a caliper rebuild kit can reseal it, including installing a new brake caliper piston seal, and it could be good as new. In many situations, it\u2019s easier and a more definitive answer to replace the caliper altogether using either a new part or a reman unit.\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable working on a safety-related system or you don\u2019t have the tools necessary to bleed the brakes afterward, it\u2019s a good idea to either get advice from a professional mechanic or have a certified tech repair your brake fluid leak for you.\n\nPreventing Future Caliper Leaks\n\nYou can\u2019t prevent Mother Nature from affecting your vehicle\u2019s operation over time, but routine maintenance can help keep it in good shape a little longer. One such thing that can be beneficial for your whole braking system including the calipers is changing the brake fluid. For most vehicles, it\u2019s a good idea to flush the fluid every two years or 25,000 miles, and that can help prevent corrosion inside the caliper.\nSometimes, low-quality parts can fail prematurely too. Rather than taking a chance on white-box parts, opt for top-quality parts from brands you\u2019ve heard of, backed by excellent customer reviews. If the part is built better, it\u2019s likely to last longer, preventing future caliper leaks.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Check Brake Pads",
        "content": "Introduction to Brake Pad Maintenance\n\nIn each brake caliper, you\u2019ll find two brake pads sandwiching the brake rotor. Their job is to convert friction to heat, stripping away the vehicle\u2019s momentum so you can come to a stop.\nWhen the brake pedal is pressed, the caliper squeezes the pads against the inner and outer surfaces of the rotor, and friction material on the brake pad bites into the metal surface. Whether the brake pads are made of ceramic, semi-metallic, or organic compounds, they generate high temperatures from the friction as forward motion is converted to heat. That\u2019s what slows your car down.\nHowever, brake pads won\u2019t stay in perfect condition their whole life. The friction material on brake pads will wear during the braking process, and environmental factors could cause contamination or delamination from the backing plate. The best way to identify brake pad condition and wear? Routine inspection. You should inspect the brakes two to four times per year during normal operation, or at minimum, once per year if you don\u2019t accumulate many miles.\n\nHow to Recognize Worn-Out Brake Pads\n\nRecognizing when your brake pads are worn is essential for maintaining optimal braking performance and ensuring your safety. Here are some signs that can help you identify worn-out brake pads:\n\nScreeching or squealing noises \u2013 One of the most common signs of worn brake pads is a high-pitched screeching or squealing noise when you apply the brakes produced by a wear indicator built into the brake pad. It makes contact with the brake rotor when the pad becomes too thin. If you hear this noise, it\u2019s a clear signal that your brake pads need attention.\nGrinding sounds \u2013 A grinding noise when braking is a more severe sign, indicating that the brake pad material has worn down to the point where the metal backing plate is making contact with the brake rotor. Immediate attention is required if you hear grinding noises or it could lead to more extensive and costly damage.\nReduced brake performance \u2013 If you notice a decrease in your vehicle\u2019s braking performance such as a longer stopping distance or a lower brake pedal, it could be a sign of worn brake pads. As the friction material wears down, the pads don\u2019t grip as well or there\u2019s more pedal travel.\nVibrations or pulsations \u2013 Worn-out brake pads can lead to vibrations or pulsations in the brake pedal when applied. This may be a sign of irregular wear on the brake pads or warped brake rotors. Either way, it\u2019s an indication that your braking system needs an inspection.\nVisual inspection \u2013 You can visually inspect your brake pads through the wheel spokes. Many vehicles have a wear indicator groove on the surface of the pad. If the pad thickness is close to or less than this groove, it\u2019s time to replace the brake pads. Additionally, if you can see less than a \u00bc-inch of pad material, it\u2019s a clear sign that replacement is needed.\n\nSome vehicles are equipped with a dashboard warning light that alerts you when the brake pads are worn. If this light illuminates, the pads are down to the minimum thickness.\n\nRecomended Tools\n\nKnowing how to check brake pad thickness is a good skill to have. Any DIYer can take care of their own brake inspection using some common items around the house and garage. You\u2019ll need:\u00a0\n\nA lug nut wrench\u00a0\nJack and jack stands\u00a0\nA flashlight\u00a0\nMechanic gloves\u00a0\u00a0\nSafety glasses\u00a0\n\nDIY Brake Pad Inspection: Step-by-Step Guide\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to complete these steps in about a half-hour for all four wheels after you\u2019ve done it a few times. Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nPark on a level surface \u2013 This ensures that your vehicle remains stable during the inspection.\u00a0\nLoosen the lug nuts \u2013 Using your lug wrench, slightly loosen the lug nuts on each wheel before lifting your car off the ground.\nLift your car using a jack and secure it with jack stands \u2013 Ensure that you place the jack in the proper location under your vehicle, then use jack stands for added security while working under it.\u00a0\nRemove the wheel \u2013 Completely remove the loosened lug nuts and take off the wheel to expose the brake assembly.\nInspect brake pads visually \u2013 Use a flashlight to look at the brake pads through spaces in caliper assembly. If less than \u00bc-inch of pad is visible, consider replacing them soon.\nCheck for irregularities \u2013 Look for uneven wear or cracks on the brake pads or indications the backing plate is separating from the friction material. These are signs that they need replacement.\u00a0\nReattach wheel and lower car \u2013 Once satisfied with your inspection or after replacing brake pads, reattach wheel securely then carefully lower car from jack stands using jack.\nRepeat process for all wheels \u2013 Do this same process for each wheel to make sure all brakes are inspected.\n\nKeep track whenever you\u2019ve inspected the brakes. Depending on how much you drive, every three to six months can be a good rule of thumb. Notice any changes in braking performance between inspections, and if braking becomes noisy or if the vehicle pulls to one side, this may hint at worn brake pads.\nKnowing how to check brake pads without removing wheels can save you a bunch of time. If your wheels have wide spokes, you can often access the brakes and inspect them from between the spokes rather than pulling the wheel off.\nRemember, front and rear brake pads will wear at different rates since the front brakes perform around 70 percent of the stopping power. Make sure you\u2019re inspecting both.\n\nCommon Brake Pad Problems and Solutions\n\nDuring routine inspections, be vigilant for common problems such as uneven wear, squealing, or reduced braking performance.\n\nIf you notice uneven wear, it could indicate issues with calipers, but it\u2019s more than often an indication they\u2019ve worn out from normal operation. Install new pads.\nIf you see the pad is coming away from the backing plate, likely it\u2019s due to corrosion or age, and even if there\u2019s plenty of pad material left, they should be changed.\nIf one end of a pad is noticeably thinner than the other, the caliper sliders may be gummed up or rusted, preventing the pad from sliding well.\nIf you see oil or grease on the brake pads, they\u2019re contaminated and won\u2019t be as effective at stopping. Don\u2019t ignore this or try to clean them \u2013 replace pads.\n\nDIY solutions for squealing noises may involve cleaning or lubricating brake components. If the pads are wearing unevenly but aren\u2019t at the minimum level yet, you might be able to get more life out of them by cleaning and adjusting the brakes. However, always adhere to manufacturer guidelines and avoid applying lubricants directly to the friction surface.\nFor more complex problems or if you\u2019re uncertain about DIY solutions, it\u2019s crucial to seek professional assistance promptly.\n\nBrake Pad Replacement\n\nThe most common indication that it\u2019s time to replace your brakes is when they\u2019re at or below \u00bc-inch of remaining friction material at the thinnest point on either the inner or outer pad on either wheel on the axle. As well, change them if the pad is delaminating or there\u2019s contamination.\nHave an annoying squeal? Even when the pads aren\u2019t worn out, you can often get rid of the noise by changing your brake pads and rotors. Low-quality pads can produce more brake dust or wear down faster, or the pad material mixture may be inconsistent and have higher concentrations of noise-causing materials. When you\u2019re installing new brake pads, use high-quality parts that get excellent reviews, and always choose parts from brand names that are industry-renowned.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Why Is My Car Leaking Brake Fluid?",
        "content": "Understanding the Vital Role of Brake Fluid\n\nWhen you press the brake pedal, your car\u2019s brake system creates hydraulic pressure within the brake lines, transmitting that force to the brake calipers or wheel cylinders, which in turn press the brake pads or shoes against the rotors or drums. This friction is what ultimately slows down and stops your vehicle. Brake fluid ensures the force from your foot is efficiently transferred to the brakes.\nWithout the incompressible nature of brake fluid, your brake pedal would feel spongy, and your vehicle\u2019s stopping power would be severely compromised. Brake fluid\u2019s ability to transmit force evenly and quickly is essential for safe braking.\nBrake fluids come in different types, each with unique properties. The two most common types are DOT 3 and DOT 4. DOT 3 brake fluid is glycol-based and widely used in most vehicles. It has a lower boiling point, making it suitable for everyday driving. DOT 4 brake fluid, also glycol-based, has a higher boiling point, making it ideal for high-performance and heavy-duty vehicles. There\u2019s also DOT 5, which is silicone-based and less common.\nIt\u2019s essential to use the right type of brake fluid specified by your vehicle\u2019s manufacturer to ensure proper brake system performance. Using the wrong type can lead to issues like reduced stopping power and can even contribute to a leak.\n\nSigns of Brake Fluid Leakage\n\nDetecting brake fluid leakage is crucial to maintaining a safe and effective brake system. Here are some common signs to watch out for:\n\nPuddle or stains \u2013 If you notice a puddle or stains with a clear or slightly yellowish color beneath your vehicle, it may be a sign of brake fluid leakage. Brake fluid is not like other automotive fluids, so its distinctive color can help you identify the issue.\nSoft or spongy pedal \u2013 A soft, spongy brake pedal that goes all the way to the floor is a clear indicator of brake fluid leakage. This occurs when air enters the brake lines due to a loss of brake fluid.\nIlluminated brake warning light \u2013 Modern cars are equipped with warning lights on the dashboard. If your brake warning light illuminates, it\u2019s essential to have your brake system inspected, as it may indicate a brake fluid leak.\nReduced braking performance \u2013 A noticeable decrease in braking performance, longer stopping distances, or a lack of responsiveness from your brakes may be a sign of insufficient brake fluid.\n\nIgnoring the warning signs of a brake fluid leak is a recipe for disaster. Brake fluid is not only crucial for stopping your car but also for preventing corrosion within the brake system. When you ignore leakage, it can lead to a chain reaction of problems including expensive repairs, corrosion inside the system, and unsafe driving conditions.\n\nCauses of Brake Fluid Leakage\n\nBrake lines are essential for your vehicle\u2019s brake system, carrying brake fluid from the master cylinder to the brake calipers or wheel cylinders. Over time, these lines can corrode or experience wear and tear. Corrosion can be caused by exposure to salt or other corrosive materials on the road, while wear and tear can result from natural aging.\nInspect your brake lines regularly, paying special attention to areas where they may be exposed to road debris or moisture. Rust or visible damage are clear signs that it\u2019s time for a replacement to prevent brake fluid leakage.\nThe brake master cylinder is the heart of the brake system, as it creates the hydraulic pressure needed to engage the brakes. Calipers are responsible for squeezing the brake pads against the rotors, generating the friction that stops your vehicle. If either of these components becomes damaged or develops leaks, it can result in brake fluid leakage.\nRegular inspections of the master cylinder and calipers are essential. Look for visible signs of leakage, such as wet or oily areas around these components. Any signs of damage or leakage should be addressed promptly to prevent further issues.\nBrake fluid can also leak due to overheating and boiling. When brake fluid reaches its boiling point, it can vaporize, creating air bubbles in the brake lines. This air can lead to a spongy brake pedal and reduced stopping power.\nBrake fluid overheating can occur during heavy braking, such as when driving downhill or towing heavy loads. Using a brake fluid with a higher boiling point, like DOT 4, can help prevent this issue. Regularly changing your brake fluid is also essential, as old, contaminated fluid laden with moisture is more prone to overheating.\n\nDIY vs. Professional Inspection and Repair\n\nRegular brake fluid checks can help you identify issues before they become major problems. Here\u2019s when you can inspect brake fluid on your own:\n\nVisual inspection \u2013 You can visually inspect the brake fluid reservoir, typically located near the firewall in the engine bay. Check the fluid level, which should be within the marked range. Also, observe the color of the fluid. It should be clear or slightly yellowish, not dark or cloudy.\u00a0\nBrake pedal feel \u2013 If you notice a change in your brake pedal\u2019s feel, such as a change in how much pressure is required, it might be a sign of brake fluid leakage.\n\nWhile DIY inspections are beneficial, some aspects of brake system maintenance are best left to professionals. Here\u2019s why:\n\nProfessional mechanics have specialized tools and equipment for diagnosing and repairing brake system issues accurately.\nTrained technicians can conduct a comprehensive inspection, identifying not only brake fluid leaks but also other potential problems in the brake system.\nProfessional mechanics have the knowledge and experience to ensure your brakes are in excellent condition, reducing the risk of accidents.\nSome brake system components come with warranties that may be voided if you attempt DIY repairs. Professional service ensures your warranties remain valid.\nBrake systems must meet strict safety standards. Professional mechanics ensure that your vehicle complies with these regulations.\n\nPreventing Brake Fluid Leaks\n\nPreventing brake fluid leaks starts with routine maintenance and care. Here are some tips to keep your brake system in top shape:\n\nFollow your manufacturer\u2019s recommended brake fluid change intervals. This prevents the fluid from becoming old and contaminated, reducing the risk of overheating and brake fluid leakage.\nRegularly inspect your brake lines for signs of corrosion or wear and tear. Replace damaged lines promptly.\nKeep an eye on your brake master cylinder and calipers for any signs of leakage or damage.\u00a0\nWhen towing or driving in hilly terrain, use engine braking and downshifting to reduce the load on your brakes, preventing fluid overheating.\nAlways use the brake fluid specified in your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual to ensure proper performance.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of brake fluid, recognizing signs of leakage, and taking preventive measures are crucial for maintaining a reliable brake system. By following these guidelines, you can ensure your vehicle\u2019s brakes perform at their best and protect yourself and others on the road.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What are Spongy Brakes and How to Fix it?",
        "content": "Understanding Spongy Brakes\n\nWhen someone mentions spongy brakes, it can mean that they\u2019re experiencing one or more of a handful of symptoms, which we\u2019ll discuss shortly. The reason is typically because there is air in the brake system, or possibly because there is moisture present inside the hydraulic brake system.\nFor the brakes to work as you expect them to, the brake fluid must compress into the lines at the rate it\u2019s designed to. When there\u2019s air present, it compresses much more readily, meaning your brake pedal has to travel further before it effectively presses pads against the rotors. And when there\u2019s moisture present, it can boil in the lines under pressure, and the resulting air bubbles cause the same effect.\nAir only gets into a brake system when there\u2019s an entry point that shouldn\u2019t be there, such as a leak at a brake hose, caliper, or master brake cylinder. Moisture, on the other hand, is more common since brake fluid is hygroscopic, and any exposure to the humidity-containing air will result in the brake fluid absorbing some.\n\nCommon Signs of Spongy Brakes\n\nSpongy brakes can exhibit several symptoms that indicate there might be air or moisture in the brake system. If you experience any of the following issues, it\u2019s a sign that your brakes might be spongy:\n\nSoft brake pedal. The brake pedal feels soft and lacks the firmness you\u2019re accustomed to. You might need to press the pedal further than usual before the brakes engage.\nIncreased pedal travel. You notice that the brake pedal is going to the floor before you feel the brakes responding. This extended travel can be an indication of air or moisture in the brake lines.\nPoor braking performance. Spongy brakes can lead to decreased braking power. Your vehicle might take longer to come to a complete stop or require more effort on the brake pedal to achieve the desired braking effect.\nInconsistent braking. If the brake pedal feels inconsistent, meaning the pressure required to engage the brakes changes erratically, it could be due to air in the system affecting the hydraulic pressure distribution.\nBrake fade. Brake fade occurs when the brakes lose their effectiveness after prolonged or heavy braking. Spongy brakes can contribute to brake fade because the air in the system can cause the brake fluid to heat up and reduce its ability to transmit pressure effectively.\nBrake warning light. Some vehicles have a brake warning light on the dashboard that might illuminate if there\u2019s an issue with the brake system, including spongy brakes. If this light comes on, it\u2019s essential to have your brakes inspected as soon as possible.\nNoise and vibration. Spongy brakes might also be accompanied by unusual noises, such as squealing or grinding, when applying the brakes, or vibrations in the brake pedal.\n\nDiagnosing Spongy Brakes\n\nDiagnosing a spongy brake pedal involves a systematic process to identify the underlying issue causing the problem. Here\u2019s a guide to help you diagnose a spongy brake pedal:\n\nVisual inspection. Start by inspecting the brake system visually. Look for any signs of brake fluid leaks around the brake lines, calipers, wheel cylinders, and the master cylinder. Check for wet spots, rust, or dampness, which could indicate a leak, and check the brake fluid level as well.\nInspect brake lines and hoses. Inspect the brake lines and hoses for any visible damage, such as kinks, bends, or cracks. Damaged lines can cause fluid leaks or air to enter the system.\nCheck brake fluid condition. If it appears dark, discolored, or contaminated, it might need to be replaced. Fresh brake fluid should be clear or slightly amber in color.\nBleed the brakes. Properly bleed the brake system to remove air. This involves using a brake bleeder kit to purge air from the brake lines. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommended bleeding procedure for your specific vehicle.\nCheck brake components. Check the condition of brake pads, rotors, calipers, and wheel cylinders as well as the master cylinder. Worn-out or damaged components can affect brake performance or let air into the system.\nChange the brake fluid. If the brake fluid appears contaminated or has absorbed moisture, it\u2019s advisable to perform a brake fluid flush to replace the old fluid with fresh fluid.\nPressure test the brakes. A pressure test of the brake system can help identify weak points or expose leaks.\n\nSeeking Professional Help\n\nSometimes, specialized equipment may be necessary to find the fault in your braking system. Or, after trying to diagnose it yourself, you might still be feeling a spongy brake pedal. The brakes are a safety system, and if you\u2019re either unable to find the problem or fix it yourself, have a professional mechanic check it for you. Seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job. Once it\u2019s diagnosed, you have the option to have them fix it for you with parts you supply, or repair it on your own.\u00a0\n\nPreventive Maintenance\n\nLike many other systems, preventing a spongy pedal comes down to routine maintenance in many cases. Contaminated brake fluid is a leading cause, and moisture or the wrong type of fluid can damage the interior of brake components. Always use the correct brake fluid for your vehicle. And when you detect moisture in the system, whether by testing for moisture content or seeing a visual change in the color or consistency, change or flush the brake fluid from the complete system. You could save yourself hundreds in repairs, or even more.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Causes Squeaky Brakes?",
        "content": "Understanding the Brake System\n\nWhen you apply pressure to the brake pedal, fluid from the reservoir is compressed into the brake lines. The fluid pressure forces mechanical motion at the wheels, whether it\u2019s the wheel cylinders extending in drum brakes or the calipers squeezing in a disc brake setup. Friction material is pressed against the drum or rotor, and it slows your car\u2019s momentum.\n\nCommon Causes of Squeaky Brakes\n\nWhen you hear a squeak or squeal from your brakes, it can be from a range of issues. You might initially be swayed to believe the brake pads are worn out, but it could also be other concerns.\n\nWorn Brake Pads or Shoes\n\nOne of the most common concerns is worn friction material, the softer blend of substances that presses against the rotor or drum when you press the brake pedal. It\u2019s typical for brake pads to wear out after 25,000 to 60,000 miles, and it varies significantly based on how and where you drive.\n\nBrake Dust and Debris\n\nSubstances that get onto your brake components can also cause annoying noises. Brake dust, road dust, and other debris can get embedded in the friction material or attach to the rotor surface. When it gets between the pad and rotor, it causes squealing. There may be times it needs to be cleaned to restore proper braking, and other times, it will simply dissipate or wear away on its own.\n\nMoisture and Humidity\n\nAfter parking your car for just a few hours, a thin film of rust can form on the rotor or drum surface, due to condensing from the air onto the hot surface. Or, rain or humidity can cause the same effect. Left unchecked if your car doesn\u2019t move for weeks, it can cause deep pitting on the rotor. But if you drive daily, or at least a few times per week, it\u2019ll wear off after a few brake applications, and the squeak will disappear with it.\n\nBrake Caliper Issues\n\nThe piston in a brake caliper can become seized over years of driving, or the sliders might not move well from dirt or corrosion. When the caliper hangs up, the pad partially drags over the rotor, and the light contact causes a high-frequency chatter that you hear as a squeak or squeal. Servicing or replacing the caliper corrects the condition.\n\nBrake Rotor or Drum Problems\nAnother common cause of brake noise is the surface that the friction material presses against, whether it\u2019s the inner surface of the drum or the more commonly used brake rotor. Deep grooves can form in the mating surface, there can be inconsistencies in thickness, or a built-up lip of corrosion or rust can form. These conditions can all cause squeaking.\n\nDiagnosing Squeaky Brakes\n\nIf your brakes are squeaking, you\u2019ll want to find out why it\u2019s happening so you can get ahead of the repairs. These are a few things you can do to determine what\u2019s going on:\u00a0\n\nTake a road test. If the squeaking is persistent the whole time, you\u2019ll need to look for a cause. If the squeaking stops after only a few braking applications, it was likely moisture or a thin film of rust that\u2019s worn away now.\nCheck the brake pad thickness. If the brake pads are worn down, a squealer tab might be contacting the rotor, causing the squeak as an early warning that it\u2019s time to replace the pads. Check both the inboard and outboard pads on all the wheels.\nInspect the rotors or drums. Look for anything more than light rust on the mating surface, and check for uneven wear on the surface too. This can cause the squeal, and they should be replaced or resurfaced.\nCheck for proper caliper movement. Ensure the sliders are moving freely and the piston is extending and retracting. If not, replace or rebuild the caliper.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring Squeaky Brakes\n\nThe noise might be annoying, but squeaky brakes can indicate safety-related issues too. If you don\u2019t deal with it, the concern likely will get worse. You could experience longer stopping distances, especially with hard braking. As well, if your pads or shoes are worn out, you might have to spend more money than otherwise necessary to replace the discs or drums from excessive wear on them.\u00a0\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Why Is My ABS Light On?",
        "content": "Understanding the ABS Light\n\nThe ABS light is governed by a series of sensors connected to the wheels and the braking system, and early systems used sensors attached to differentials instead. These ABS sensors monitor the speed at which your wheels are rotating. If one or more wheels are spinning significantly faster or slower than the others \u2013 a condition that can occur when brakes lock up \u2013 the ABS system intervenes to adjust brake fluid pressure, allowing the wheels to regain traction.\nEssentially, it\u2019s an indicator for the ABS control module\u2019s functions. This module monitors the anti-lock braking system and triggers a warning if there is any issue or malfunction detected. When you see this light present on the dashboard, typically it\u2019s an amber or red symbol that reads \u201cABS\u201d.\nWhen everything is functioning properly with your vehicle\u2019s anti-lock brakes, the light should briefly illuminate when you start your car, then switch off. This is a self-check process, confirming that the ABS system is operational. If the light stays on after this initial check, or it illuminates while you\u2019re driving, it\u2019s indicating that there\u2019s a problem with the ABS.\n\nCommon Causes of ABS Light On\n\nWhy is my ABS light on? If issues in the ABS system itself are detected, the ABS light will come on. Common issues can include:\n\nLow brake fluid levels\nWorn-out brake pads\nA blown fuse\nA damaged wheel speed sensor\nDamage to a tone wheel on an axle\nLoose or worn wheel bearings or hubs\nOr even issues with the system\u2019s wiring\n\nNot all of these concerns are directly related to the ABS system, but they can affect how it operates.\n\nTroubleshooting the ABS Light\n\nTroubleshooting an ABS light can be a complex process, as it involves various components of your vehicle\u2019s braking system. However, here are some steps you can take to diagnose the problem:\u00a0\n\nIgnition key cycling. The simplest thing to try is turning the ignition key off and back on, similar to power cycling your computer.\nChecking the brake fluid reservoir. Ensure that the brake fluid levels aren\u2019t too low in the reservoir, as this can trigger the ABS warning light.\nInspecting the ABS fuse. A blown fuse could be the culprit. Check the ABS fuse in your vehicle\u2019s fuse box and replace it if necessary. Keep in mind that a blown fuse is often an indicator of a fault that needs attention.\nTesting the ABS wheel sensor. If a wheel speed sensor is faulty, it can cause the ABS light to illuminate. Use a multimeter to check the sensor\u2019s resistance and compare it with the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Replace it if it fails.\nReplacing the ABS module. If all else fails, the issue may lie within the ABS module itself. In such cases, replacing the module may solve the problem.\nChecking wheel bearings or hubs for play. Inspect or measure for excessive wheel play that can affect if the sensor is properly positioned to read the tone wheel.\nInspect for damaged wiring. It\u2019s not uncommon for the wires on a wheel speed sensor at the hub to be damaged by road debris or become corroded. Repair any damage and retest.\nResetting the ABS light. Disconnect the positive cable from your car battery, then let the electrical system\u2019s residual power drain by activating the headlight switch. This method can sometimes reset the ABS warning light. Or, use an OBD-II scanner to reset the ABS light.\n\nPotential Risks and Consequences\n\nOne of the primary risks of driving with the ABS light on is an increased stopping distance. It may lead to longer stopping distances, especially during emergency braking situations and could potentially result in a collision.\nAlso, if the ABS system is compromised, there\u2019s a risk of losing steering control during heavy braking. Without the anti-lock feature, the wheels can lock up, causing the vehicle to skid and making it difficult to steer.\nContinuing to operate your vehicle with an active ABS light can also lead to further damage to the braking system. Issues that initially trigger the ABS light such as low brake fluid levels, blown fuses, or bad wheel sensors, could potentially worsen over time if not addressed promptly.\nAnd in some instances, driving with the ABS light on could also have legal implications. Depending on local regulations, it may be considered illegal to drive with an active ABS warning light and it may fail a vehicle inspection.\n\nSeeking Professional Help\n\nBecause it\u2019s a safety system, it\u2019s best that only confident, experienced DIYers should try to diagnose and repair the problem. Not only is there potential to misdiagnose the concern, but performing a repair incorrectly could cause the ABS system to activate when it shouldn\u2019t, or it might not work at all. If you\u2019re not sure of your skills, it\u2019s often best to get the help of a professional to diagnose and repair the problem.",

        "title": "What Are Brake Shoes?",
        "content": "Understanding the Braking System\n\nDrum brakes serve a dual purpose. First and foremost, they are designed to slow down or stop your vehicle. When you apply pressure to the brake pedal, it triggers a series of events that cause the brake shoes to press against the drum. This friction slows down the rotation of the wheels, allowing you to safely reduce speed or come to a complete stop.\nThe second purpose of drum brakes is to act as a parking brake. In many vehicles, the handbrake or emergency brake lever operates the drum brakes, ensuring your car stays put when parked.\nWhen you press the brake pedal, brake fluid moves from the master cylinder to the wheel cylinders located at each brake drum, forcing brake shoes outward to press on the inner hat of the drum. The friction it creates turns kinetic energy, or motion, into thermal energy, or heat. This slows your wheels so you can stop your car.\n\nComponents of Brake Shoes\n\nThere are only a few parts of a brake shoe itself, including:\n\nThe friction material, which is a wearable layer that\u2019s softer than the cast iron a drum is made of.\u00a0\nThe shoe body or backing plate that the friction material is bonded to that provides structural support.\nAnchor pins that secure the shoes to the brake backing plate.\nPivot pins that allow the shoes to move outwardly and return.\n\nAlong with these parts, the drum brake system uses an adjuster mechanism, actuating lever, and other hold-down springs and clips to keep the shoe in place and allow it to be adjusted.\u00a0\n\nInspecting Brake Shoes\n\nChecking your car\u2019s brake shoes is almost the same process as how to replace brake shoes, except the shoes aren\u2019t removed and changed as a final step.\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to remove the wheel when your car is secured in the air. Then, clips holding the drum to the wheel studs will need to be removed before the drum can be taken off. From behind the drum, an inspection plug needs to be removed and the adjuster backed off to release tension against the drum. Only then can the drum hat be shimmied free.\nWhen the drum is off, the shoes can be checked for consistent wear, cracks or damage, or glazing and fading. If there\u2019s any grease on the shoes, they\u2019re contaminated and should be changed, and any broken hardware should also be corrected. If the material is less than 1/4-inch in thickness remaining at the thinnest point, the shoes are due to be replaced.\n\nPotential Risks of Neglected Brake Shoes\u00a0\n\nNeglecting brake shoes and failing to address issues promptly can lead to several potential risks and hazards, including:\n\nReduced braking performance \u2013 Worn brake shoes with thin or depleted brake lining material may result in reduced braking effectiveness, increasing the stopping distance and compromising the vehicle\u2019s ability to stop safely.\nBrake fade \u2013 If the brake shoes are excessively worn or glazed, they may be prone to brake fade. Brake fade occurs when the friction between the brake lining and drum diminishes due to overheating, resulting in a loss of braking power and longer stopping distances.\nBrake noise and vibration \u2013 Neglected brake shoes may produce squealing, grinding, or scraping noises during braking. These noises can indicate worn-out brake lining, improper shoe-to-drum contact, or other underlying issues. Vibrations or pulsations in the brake pedal can also occur, indicating problems with brake shoe operation.\nIncreased risk of accidents \u2013 Insufficient braking performance due to neglected brake shoes can significantly increase the risk of accidents. Inadequate stopping power can lead to collisions, especially in emergency situations or when braking is required on slippery or uneven surfaces.\nDamage to brake drum \u2013 Worn-out or damaged brake shoes can cause excessive friction and heat, leading to scoring or grooving on the inner surface of the brake drum. This can necessitate costly repairs or even require drum replacement.\nExpensive repairs \u2013 If neglected brake shoes cause further damage to the braking system, the subsequent repairs can be more extensive and costly. Replacing brake shoes in a timely manner is a more economical approach than dealing with larger repairs or potential system failures.\n\nChoosing the Right Brake Shoes\n\nOnly a select number of brake shoes will fit your car. They must be the exact dimensions as the factory-equipped shoes or they won\u2019t fit within the drums, or they\u2019ll be too small to apply any friction to the inner surface.\nBut there certainly are differences in the materials they\u2019re manufactured from.\n\nOrganic brake shoes are made of materials like carbon, fiberglass strands, and other soft materials. They\u2019re optimized for quiet, comfortable stops but wear faster than others.\nSemi-metallic brake shoes have materials like copper, steel, iron, and other metals along with graphite. They transfer heat better for more aggressive stops and they last longer, but they tend to be noisier.\nCeramic brake shoes are formed from ceramic and other materials like copper strands. They\u2019re quiet and long-lasting, produce less dust, but they tend to be pricier.\n\nWhich option you choose depends on the characteristics you value most.\n\nMaintenance Tips for Brake Shoes\n\nBrake shoe replacement intervals tend to be longer, mainly since the rear brakes apply around 30 percent of the stopping power. But you can help keep them in great shape for longer with these tips:\n\nSlow down gently, anticipate stops, and you\u2019ll be able to extend the life of your brake shoes.\nOverloading your vehicle can put extra stress on your brakes, so carry light loads when possible.\u00a0\nCheck your brakes at least once per year.\nClean brake dust from within the drums every 15,000 miles or so, and adjust them for optimal stopping power.",

        "title": "Should I Replace or Resurface Brake Rotors?",
        "content": "Signs of Brake Rotor Damage\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that brake rotors are going to wear. With the extreme pressure put on them from both sides by brake pads squeezing within a caliper, there\u2019s high temperatures generated as well as abrasion. And since they\u2019re bare metal exposed in an unforgiving environment, it\u2019s natural that corrosion can form too.\nWhen your brake rotors are in rough shape, you\u2019ll notice one or more of these common symptoms:\n\nUnusual noises such as squeaking, squealing, or grinding sounds when braking.\nVibration or pulsation felt in the brake pedal or steering wheel during braking.\nDeep grooves or scoring visible on the rotor surface.\nDiscolored or bluish heat spots on the rotor caused by excessive heat.\nRotors no longer flat or even, causing uneven contact with brake pads.\nSmall or large cracks on the rotor surface, especially near the edges.\nExcessive rust buildup on the rotor surface or around the edges.\n\nWhen to Replace Brake Rotors\n\nSometimes, brake rotors simply need to be replaced. If there are cracks present on either side of the rotor, they should be discarded and a new one installed. And when the rotor needed to be beat on with a hammer in an attempt to unseat it from the hub, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s been slightly misshapen and can\u2019t be resurfaced.\nOne of the most important factors is the rotor\u2019s remaining thickness. Each rotor has a discard level, typically stamped on the rotor hub or rim. It must be measured by a micrometer and, if the rotor won\u2019t be at or more than the minimum thickness after it\u2019s resurfaced, it should be discarded.\nWhen to Resurface Brake Rotors\nIn many instances, though, rotors can be salvaged for another go-round. You can usually resurface rotors if:\n\nThere\u2019s at least .050\u201d thickness more than the discard level.\nThere isn\u2019t heavy corrosion on the edge.\nThe rotor surface isn\u2019t heavily blued.\nAny grooves are shallow in the contact area.\n\nFactors to Consider: Replace or Resurface?\n\nIt\u2019s possible to resurface or machine brake rotors for most vehicles, but there are a variety of factors that might influence your decision either way. These are the advantages and disadvantage of the two options.\n\nAdvantages of Replacing Brake Rotors\n\nThe brake job can be completed quicker since there\u2019s no time necessary to resurface the rotors on a lathe.\nIt can prevent warping since the rotors are full thickness and there\u2019s no chance they\u2019ve been overheated previously.\nIt affords peace of mind that your brakes are in new condition.\n\nDrawbacks of Replacing Brake Rotors\n\nThe cost to replace brake rotors can often be two to three times that of resurfacing rotors, although some models have low-cost replacement options available.\nIt might result in a wait for parts to arrive if you haven\u2019t previously purchased the rotors.\n\nAdvantages of Resurfacing Brake Rotors\n\nThe cost can be significantly lower, especially for high-performance and luxury models, when you resurface the rotors.\nCar parts avoid filling the landfill. It\u2019s a greener solution.\nMost types of minimal to moderate damage can be corrected in about 30 minutes per pair.\n\nDrawbacks of Resurfacing Brake Rotors\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that resurfacing rotors may not be successful, especially if you had a serious steering wheel vibration or shimmy from warped rotors.\nRusty rotors may not disperse heat very well, even with a fresh resurfacing, leading to overheating sooner than you\u2019d hope.\nSome types of damage might not be evident initially such as hairline cracks, that means a replacement rotor is still necessary after resurfacing is complete.",

        "title": "When Should You Resurface Your Rotors?",
        "content": "Signs that Indicate the Need for Resurfacing\n\nAs soon as they\u2019re installed on a vehicle, brake rotors are exposed to the harsh reality of friction, heat, and corrosion. Although they\u2019re commonly cast iron or steel, they will experience wear and other symptoms from your normal driving, and even more so if you\u2019re an aggressive driver. Signs that rotor resurfacing is needed include:\n\nA steering wheel vibration when you press the brake pedal, especially at high speed. This is because of a thickness variance in one or both front rotors, sometimes considered to be warped.\nShimmying or shaking in the vehicle body, often felt through the seat or brake pedal. Similar to the steering wheel vibration, it\u2019s due to thickness variances on the rotor\u2019s surface, but usually for a rear rotor.\nA grinding noise when the brakes are applied. The noise is due to contact between the brake pads and rust or corrosion on the rotor, or when brake pads are completely worn out, the backing plate on a brake pad against the rotor.\nSquealing noises on application. Rotors that are contaminated or glazed can cause this squeal, along with longer stopping distances.\nGrooves around the circumference of the rotor surface. From normal wear and tear, you might notice these grooves that can be felt by hand.\nThe brake pads are worn out. To give new brake pads a good, flat, uncontaminated surface to grip, you should resurface the rotors during a brake job.\n\nAny one of these symptoms can be the nudge you need to think about resurfacing your rotors.\n\nFactors to Consider Before Resurfacing Your Rotors\n\nIt\u2019s not always advised to resurface a rotor. In some instances, a replacement is best. That\u2019s the case if your rotor is thinner than the minimum specification, or if it will be after resurfacing the rotor. Each rotor is manufactured with a minimum thickness spec. You\u2019ll find this spec stamped on the rotor hub sometimes, or you might need to look it up with software like ALLDATA. Use a micrometer to determine the current thickness, then compare it with the minimum spec. If there\u2019s some difference, the rotor may be able to be resurfaced.\nAs well, you should consider the overall condition of the rotor. Is there lots of flaky rust along the edge or in the vents? Did you need to pound the rotor off of the hub, potentially warping it? Are the grooves deep on the rotor\u2019s surface? Answering \u2018yes\u2019 to any of these questions could mean replacements are the better option.\n\nBenefits of Properly Resurfaced Rotors\n\nDone well, brake rotor resurfacing can be a successful way of saving you some money since it\u2019s often lower cost than replacing the rotor. Other benefits include:\n\nExtended brake pad lifespan. A rough rotor surface can eat up a brake pad prematurely, often tens of thousands of miles sooner than a fresh rotor surface.\nSmooth, efficient braking performance. You can experience shorter stopping distances and a smoother, less fatiguing drive when you resurface rotors.\nLess noise and vibration. The embarrassing feeling of squealing or grinding brakes in traffic can disappear if your rotors are resurfaced.\n\nCommon Misconceptions About Rotor Resurfacing\n\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about getting your rotors resurfaced, there are a few misconceptions that you shouldn\u2019t overlook. The first is that it\u2019s always necessary to resurface rotors during brake pad replacement. If the rotors appear to be flat and in good condition and there aren\u2019t any vibrations, it\u2019s possible to simply install new brake pads.\nSecondly, you can\u2019t save every rotor. Sometimes, the runout on a rotor is too great to cut away without surpassing the discard thickness level, or the grooves are too deep.\nLastly, you should know when to resurface and when to replace rotors. It\u2019s not always less expensive to resurface rotors rather than replace them.",

        "title": "What Are Brake Calipers?",
        "content": "What Are Brake Calipers?\n\nIn your vehicle\u2019s disc braking system, brake calipers play a crucial role in slowing down or stopping your vehicle safely and efficiently. It\u2019s a hydraulic device that houses the brake pads and a single or multiple pistons, which apply pressure to the brake rotor when you press the brake pedal.\nAs the brake pedal is depressed, hydraulic fluid from the master cylinder is forced through the brake lines, causing the piston(s) within the caliper to extend, pushing the brake pads against the spinning brake rotor. The resulting friction between the brake pads and the rotor converts kinetic energy into heat, effectively decelerating or stopping the vehicle.\n\nTypes of Brake Calipers\n\nThere are several types of brake calipers used in automotive braking systems. Here are the most common designs:\n\nFixed calipers are bolted directly to the steering knuckle and do not move. They have pistons on both sides of the rotor, which apply equal pressure to the brake pads for even distribution of force. This design provides better braking performance and is commonly found in high-performance and sports cars.\nFloating or sliding calipers have a single piston on one side of the rotor and can slide back and forth on guide pins or bushings. When the brakes are applied, the piston pushes the inner brake pad against the rotor, and the caliper slides to press the outer pad against the rotor as well. This design is more common on everyday vehicles due to its lower cost and simpler construction.\nSimilar to opposed piston calipers, dual-piston calipers have two pistons on one side of the rotor. This design provides improved clamping force and better heat dissipation compared to single-piston floating calipers. They are often found on trucks, SUVs, and some performance vehicles.\nFour-piston calipers have two pistons on each side of the rotor, providing better clamping force and heat dissipation than dual-piston calipers. These are commonly used in high-performance vehicles and racing applications. There are also six-piston designs that are virtually identical except with three pistons per side.\n\nHow to Maintain Brake Calipers\n\nThe calipers on your car are exposed to harsh conditions, and a little brake maintenance should include dealing with the calipers too. To keep them in good shape so they last as long as possible, follow these maintenance tips:\n\nInspect regularly. Periodically check your brake calipers for signs of wear or damage. Look for any visible cracks, leaks, or corrosion on the caliper body, pistons, and seals.\n\nClean the caliper. Remove dirt, dust, and debris from the caliper using a brush and brake cleaner. Keeping the caliper clean prevents the buildup of contaminants that can cause the piston to stick and reduce braking efficiency.\n\nLubricate. Apply a high-temperature brake grease to the caliper slide pins or bushings to ensure smooth movement of the caliper during braking. This reduces friction and prevents premature wear.\n\nCheck brake pads. Monitor the thickness of your brake pads and replace them when they reach the minimum recommended thickness. Worn pads can cause excessive heat and damage the caliper.\n\nFlush brake fluid. Replace your brake fluid according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended intervals. Old or contaminated fluid can lead to reduced braking performance and damage to the caliper seals.\n\nBut even with maintenance, there can still be a failure that requires action.\n\nRebuilding a Brake Caliper\n\nOver time, calipers can wear out, and seals can deteriorate. Rebuilding a brake caliper involves disassembling the caliper, cleaning all components, replacing worn or damaged parts from a caliper rebuild kit, and reassembling the unit.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt starts with removing the caliper, then disassembling it to perform a full cleaning and assessment. If it\u2019s just the piston, bushings, slide pins, and seals that are worn, a rebuild may be successful. Once you\u2019ve installed the new components from a caliper rebuild kit, it can be re-installed and tested to make sure it\u2019s working well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRebuilding vs. Replacement: Which is Right for You?\n\nWith calipers often being reasonably priced, is it better to rebuild or replace it? Both rebuilding and replacing a brake caliper have their advantages and disadvantages:\nRebuilding:\n\nCost-effective \u2013 Rebuilding a caliper is usually cheaper than buying a new or remanufactured unit.\nCustomization \u2013 You can upgrade components during the rebuild process, such as using stainless steel pistons or high-performance seals.\nEnvironmentally friendly \u2013 Reusing your existing caliper reduces waste.\n\nReplacement:\n\nConvenience \u2013 Purchasing a new or remanufactured caliper saves time and effort compared to rebuilding.\nWarranty \u2013 New and remanufactured calipers often come with a warranty, providing peace of mind.\nConsistency \u2013 A new or remanufactured caliper guarantees that all components meet factory specifications.\n\nUltimately, the decision between rebuilding and replacing a brake caliper depends on factors such as cost, time, skill level, and personal preferences.",

        "title": "Should I Replace All 4 Brake Pads At Once?",
        "content": "What Are Brake Pads and How Do They Work?\n\nBrake pads are designed to create the friction required to slow down or stop your moving vehicle. They work in conjunction with other parts such as brake rotors and calipers, to ensure efficient and safe braking.\nConstructed from a combination of metallic, ceramic, or organic materials, brake pads are engineered to withstand high temperatures and pressure during the braking process. They\u2019re mounted within the brake caliper, which houses a hydraulic piston that applies force to the brake pads when the driver presses the brake pedal.\nAs the brake pedal is pressed, hydraulic fluid within the brake lines transmits the force to the brake caliper, causing the piston to push the brake pads against the spinning brake rotor. The resulting friction between the brake pads and the rotor converts kinetic energy into heat, effectively slowing down or stopping the vehicle.\nOver time, the friction material on the brake pads gradually wears down, reducing their effectiveness, and they\u2019ll need to be changed.\n\nWhen to Replace Brake Pads\n\nTo keep your braking system working effectively, the brake pads need to be inspected regularly and replaced if they aren\u2019t in good shape anymore. There isn\u2019t a specific interval for replacing them, but it depends mostly on driving habits, the type of vehicle, and the material the brake pads are made of. Factors to consider include:\n\nMileage \u2013 Typically, brake pads should be replaced every 30,000 to 70,000 miles. However, this range can vary based on the factors previously mentioned.\nBrake pad thickness \u2013 A visual inspection of the brake pads can give you insight into their condition. Brake pads should generally have at least 1/4 inch of friction material remaining.\nWarning indicators \u2013 Some vehicles come equipped with wear sensors that trigger a dashboard warning light when the brake pads are nearing the end of their lifespan.\nSqueaking or squealing noises \u2013 Unusual noises during braking, such as squeaking or squealing, can be an indication that the brake pads are worn and need replacement.\nGrinding sounds \u2013 If you hear a grinding sound while braking, it may indicate that the brake pads have completely worn down, and metal is rubbing against metal.\nReduced braking performance \u2013 If you notice longer stopping distances or a less responsive brake pedal, it may be a sign that the brake pads are worn.\n\nShould You Replace All 4 Brake Pads at Once?\n\nFour brake pads come in the package, but do you need to use them all or just change the ones that are worn out? The short answer is that you should replace all the brake pads that come with the kit.\nAt any particular wheel, the inner and outer brake pads will likely be different thicknesses when you measure them. The inner pad usually looks to be in better shape, but both should be changed at the same time so there\u2019s equal pressure applied to the rotor. There\u2019s no guarantee that the friction material consistency will be the same as the old pads, and it can cause problems with braking performance if they\u2019re not applying the same friction.\nAnd to ensure both wheels on the same axle are applying even pressure, change your car\u2019s brakes on each axle, left and right side.\n\nThe Process of Replacing Brake Pads\n\nA popular DIY project in the garage is brake pad replacement. Getting it done requires a handful of tools, but you\u2019ll have most around a well-equipped garage.\nStart by parking on a level surface, then set the parking brake and lift the wheel off the ground where you\u2019ll be working. Remove the wheel and set it aside.\nNext, remove the brake caliper bracket mounting bolts from the wheel knuckle. On some cars, the caliper itself needs to be removed too. Either way, push the piston back into the caliper so there\u2019s room for the new pads to fit.\u00a0 Secure the caliper out of the way so the caliper\u2019s weight isn\u2019t borne by the brake hose.\nRemove the brake pads from the caliper or bracket, noting how they fit in. If hardware such as clips or lubricant were included in the package, install them first, then put your new brake pads in place.\nPut the caliper back on, torquing it to the spec you\u2019ll find in a service manual. Then, put the wheel on and lower your car. Pump the brakes until there\u2019s firm pressure in the pedal before starting the engine and carefully taking a test drive.\n\nCost of Replacing Brake Pads\n\nIf you\u2019re replacing brake pads yourself, all you need to pay for are the parts. Per-axle, account for $30 to $50 for a set of brake pads, but consider whether the rotors need to be changed too. But if you\u2019re taking your car to a mechanic for the brake job, it\u2019s likely around $150 to $200 per axle to get it completed. Of course, this varies by vehicle model and the type of friction material you choose.\n\nMaintenance Tips to Extend Brake Pad Life\n\nTo maximize brake pad life and ensure optimal braking performance, follow these informative and straightforward tips:\n\nPractice smooth driving habits \u2013 Abrupt stops and aggressive driving can cause excessive wear on your brake pads. Adopt a smoother driving style by anticipating stops, gradually applying the brakes, and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.\nAvoid unnecessary braking \u2013 To reduce wear on your brake pads, try to avoid braking when it\u2019s not required. Instead, release the accelerator pedal and allow your vehicle to decelerate naturally whenever possible.\nMaintain proper tire inflation \u2013 Ensuring that your tires are inflated to the recommended pressure levels can help maintain even braking force distribution, reducing stress on your brake pads and promoting longer pad life.\nRemove excess weight \u2013 Carrying unnecessary weight in your vehicle can increase the load on your brake pads, leading to faster wear.\nRegularly inspect and maintain your braking system \u2013 Periodic inspection of your brake pads, rotors, calipers, and brake fluid can help identify and address any issues before they lead to pad wear or damage.\nUse high-quality brake pads \u2013 Investing in high-quality brake pads made from durable materials can contribute to longer pad life and improved braking performance.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Brake Light Switch",
        "content": "What Causes a Bad Brake Light Switch?\n\nA bad brake light switch is typically caused by wear or damage to the switch itself, the wiring or connectors leading to the switch or the brake pedal mechanism that activates the switch. Over time, the switch can become worn or damaged due to regular use and exposure to moisture and dirt in the footwell. Imagine how many times you press the brake pedal for every mile you travel in stop-and-go traffic, and what that means for times the brake light switch operates.\nAdditionally, if the brake pedal is not adjusted properly, it can cause stress on the brake light switch, leading to premature wear. In some cases, electrical issues or problems with the brake light circuit can also cause issues with the brake light switch, such as a blown fuse or a faulty relay.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad Brake Light Switch\n\nIf you have a bad brake light switch, symptoms can vary depending on your vehicle. However, two of the most prevalent and common are that the brake lights stay on all the time if the switch fails in the closed position, or the brake lights won\u2019t illuminate at all when the pedal is pressed, indicating a failure in the open position.\nThese symptoms aren\u2019t exhaustive, though. Other potential concerns can include:\n\nThe cruise control won\u2019t set or it cancels unexpectedly\nBrake lights flickering or activating intermittently\nThe shift interlock won\u2019t disengage, and you can\u2019t move the gearshift lever normally or it might be stuck in park\nAn ABS light illuminated\n\nSome redundant switches \u2013 a secondary switch that\u2019s either integrated or altogether separate \u2013 can confuse you with the symptoms. For example, you might not be able to set your cruise control but the brake lights illuminate normally.\n\nHow to Diagnose a Bad Brake Light Switch\n\nIf you suspect that you have a bad brake light switch, here are a few diagnostic steps you can take:\n\nWatch the brake lights. Normally, the simplest way to check whether or not your brake light switch is working is to observe the brake lights when you apply the brakes. If the brake lights don\u2019t come on or work intermittently, there\u2019s a good chance the brake light switch is faulty.\nCheck the fuse. A blown brake light fuse can also cause the brake lights to fail, so check the fuse box to make sure the fuse hasn\u2019t blown.\nRemove the brake light switch. You can remove the switch and check for signs of damage or wear. Look for any cracks, melted plastic, or frayed wires. It\u2019s also a good idea to clean the switch with a wire brush and reconnect it to see if that fixes the problem.\nUse a multimeter.\u00a0 If you have a multimeter, you can use it to test the continuity of the brake light switch. First, disconnect the switch and set the multimeter to the continuity setting. Then, touch the leads of the multimeter to the two terminals on the switch. Press the switch. If there\u2019s continuity when it\u2019s pressed and it stops when the switch is released, the switch is working properly.\nTest the power supply. You can also use a test light to check whether the brake light switch is getting power or not. With the ignition on and the brake pedal pressed, connect the test light to the negative terminal on the battery and then touch the other end to one of the wires on the brake light switch. If the test light doesn\u2019t light up, there\u2019s a problem with the power supply to the brake light switch.\n\nIf any of these tests indicate a problem with the brake light switch, it will need to be replaced. It\u2019s important to consult your service manual or a professional mechanic if you\u2019re unsure of how to replace the brake light switch on your specific vehicle or if any issues arise during the replacement process.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Brake Hose",
        "content": "What is a Brake Hose?\n\nA brake hose is a flexible section that connects the rigid brake lines to the wheel cylinders or brake calipers at each of the four wheels. The hoses are responsible for carrying brake fluid, which helps apply hydraulic or fluid pressure to the brakes and stop your vehicle when you step on the pedal. The hoses themselves can be made out of either natural and synthetic rubber or steel-braided material and are reinforced with Kevlar or cotton strands.\nThe most important part, though, is the inner liner. Typically made of a corrosion-resistant PTFE formula that contains Teflon, it keeps fluid on the inside and moving in the direction it needs to go.\n\nHow Does a Brake Hose Work in a Vehicle?\n\nBrake hoses work by transferring hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder to each individual wheel whenever you press on the pedal. The pressure moves through the brake lines and then into each wheel, applying force on the caliper pistons which in turn apply pressure on your disc rotors or drum brakes. This action helps your car come to a stop quickly and safely. The hose has to be flexible, but it also needs to resist bulging or bursting, which is why it\u2019s reinforced.\n\nCommon Symptoms of a Bad Brake Hose\n\nBrake hoses are exposed to the elements like harsh temperature changes, humidity, and chemical compounds from the road. Over time, they\u2019re going to deteriorate and exhibit bad brake hose symptoms that clue you into the need to perform a repair. Five common signs include:\n\nLeaks \u2013 If you see fluid dripping onto one of your rims or the ground and it\u2019s clear or light brown, slightly oily to the touch, and odorless it\u2019s probably a brake fluid leak and it could be coming from a brake hose.\nSpongy brakes \u2013 When the pedal feel isn\u2019t firm and consistent when you press it but feels spongy, it indicates air has entered the system, which could be from a bad brake hose.\nReduced braking power \u2013 Some vehicles have a dashboard warning that illuminates when the brake fluid is low, indicating \u2018reduced braking power\u2019. One common cause is a leak at a brake hose.\nSquealing or grinding brakes \u2013 When a brake hose has deteriorated and collapsed internally, it restricts flow back and forth to the brakes at that wheel. It can cause the brakes to drag, contributing to brake noises all the time, not just when the pedal is pressed.\nUneven braking application \u2013 If a hose is leaking or has collapsed, the car could dive to one side when you apply the brakes or constantly feel like there\u2019s an anchor on your car when you\u2019re driving.\u00a0\n\nWhat Causes a Brake Hose to Fail?\n\nA few different factors can contribute to a bad brake hose. The first and most common is that it can rupture from cracking or aging since rubber gets brittle and dry over time. Or, it can fail from rubbing through against a suspension component or some other type of physical damage.\nBrake fluid contamination can also cause a faulty brake hose. If the wrong type of fluid is added, a hose can swell or degrade, causing it to collapse or spring a leak.\n\nWhat to Do If You Suspect a Faulty Brake Hose?\n\nFirst and foremost, if you think you have a bad brake hose, don\u2019t drive your car! It would be risking a collision due to poor brake performance.\nInspect your vehicle\u2019s brakes and confirm that the brake hoses are good. If they aren\u2019t replace the bad hose or hoses before you resume driving. Once you\u2019ve changed the faulty brake hose, make sure you bleed the lines and top up the reservoir with clean fluid.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Brake Master Cylinder",
        "content": "When to Replace a Brake Master Cylinder\n\nWhether you know how to replace a master cylinder or not, the first step is to identify when it needs to be changed. You\u2019ll need to diagnose it completely since many of the symptoms are the same as when other brake components are bad. Symptoms can include:\n\nVisible leaks at the master cylinder. Often, it\u2019s an integrated fluid reservoir, a seam, or the plunger inside that leak.\nBrake pedal fade. A soft, spongy, or inconsistent pedal can signify that the master cylinder is allowing air into the hydraulic system.\nPulling when you brake. If the hydraulic output is uneven, the brakes can cause a pull to one side.\n\nTools and Equipment Required\n\nReplacing a brake master cylinder requires several pieces of equipment and tools such as:\n\nFloor jack and jack stands\nFlat screwdriver or pry bar\nWrench set\nRatchet and socket set\nNew brake master cylinder\nAppropriate brake fluid\nBrake cleaner\nBrake bleeder kit\nDrain pan\n\nSteps to Replace a Brake Master Cylinder\n\nSet aside at least a few hours to replace your brake master cylinder. Even if you\u2019re an experienced tech of backyard mechanic, there\u2019s always the potential for a stage of the process to go sideways.\n\n1. Prepare the Vehicle\n\nBefore you can replace a brake master cylinder, get your vehicle ready, and use safety equipment such as eyewear and protective gloves before starting any type of automotive repair or maintenance. You will also need to elevate the vehicle in order to properly access the brake calipers or wheel cylinders after the repair, so use jacks and stands for this task.\nAlso be sure to set the parking brake and loosen the wheels\u2019 lug nuts while your vehicle is still on the ground \u2013 this way they\u2019re easier to remove when you lift up your car or truck.\n\n2. Remove the Old Master Cylinder\n\nBefore installing a new brake master cylinder, the old one needs to be removed. First, locate the brake lines connected to the master cylinder. Once you\u2019ve identified these, use an appropriate wrench or socket along with some penetrating oil and carefully loosen each line until they can be removed without any debris getting inside of them.\nFinally, unscrew the mounting bolts that attach the master cylinder itself and then pull it away from its position.\nPut the old master cylinder in a drain pan to prevent brake fluid from dripping. It can damage any painted surfaces in seconds.\n\n3. Install the New Master Cylinder\n\nBefore installing the new master cylinder, make sure you\u2019ve thoroughly cleaned the area inside the engine compartment. Then, bench bleed the new master cylinder by pressing the plunger for 10 to 15 seconds at a time until it no longer can be pressed in more than 1/8-inch.\nTransfer hydraulic lines from the old master cylinder if necessary, then install it onto the brake booster, making sure that it\u2019s evenly tightened on both sides. Once secure, tighten the brake lines in place. Test for any leaks before bleeding your brakes. Finally, don\u2019t forget to top up your brake fluid reservoir afterward.\n\n4. Bleed the Brakes\n\nAfter the brake master cylinder has been successfully installed, it is essential to bleed the brakes to ensure you have a consistent brake feel and the right performance. It\u2019s a good practice to start bleeding the brakes at the wheel farthest from the master cylinder and then move around to each wheel in the next closest proximity until all of them have had their brakes bled. During this process, either a second person or a brake bleeder kit should be used.\nAnd you\u2019re finished when there are no air bubbles left coming out of the lines. If this procedure is followed correctly, you can rest assured that your vehicle will have effective brakes.\n\nTips and Precautions\n\nReplacing a brake master cylinder should be completed with caution.\n\nMake sure to safely lift the vehicle before attempting this repair, and ensure that all necessary tools are on hand.\nPay special attention to the brake lines and clamps, as it is important not to crack a line and lose brake fluid.\nFinally, make sure to check for leaks after the job is complete and tighten all fittings before returning the vehicle back to the ground.",

        "title": "Signs of a Bad Brake Booster",
        "content": "The Importance of Fixing a Bad Brake Booster\n\nA bad brake booster can be a serious problem. Braking performance can suffer and the vehicle\u2019s ability to stop quickly and safely could be compromised. A failing brake booster can mean longer stopping distances, which increases the risk of an accident in certain situations. It\u2019s also unpredictable, so you might not anticipate the increased stopping distance.\n\nCommon Signs of a Bad Brake Booster\n\nIf your brake booster is failing or it\u2019s no longer functioning, it can affect your braking system as well as other systems. Signs can include:\n\nThe brake pedal is harder to push than normal. Since the brake booster operates with vacuum, the degree to which the brakes are more difficult to apply can vary. Often, the first application can be almost normal while subsequent applications shortly after get progressively harder.\nIt takes longer to stop your car. Since your braking power doesn\u2019t have the necessary assistance from the booster, your stopping distance can increase.\nEngine stumbling or stalling. If there\u2019s a massive vacuum leak in the booster, it could draw more boost than normal when you apply the brakes. It takes vacuum away from other components, and it can cause your engine to stumble, the RPMs to drop, and your engine could stall.\nThe Check Engine Light can come on. Some cars are equipped with a brake booster vacuum sensor. If you have a leak, it can trigger the Check Engine light to come on.\nWhistling sounds. A vacuum leak at the booster can translate into a whistling or hissing sound, and it\u2019s often worst when applying the brakes.\n\nSteps for Diagnosing a Bad Brake Booster\n\nIf you have bad brake booster symptoms, there really isn\u2019t any time to delay. A quick, accurate diagnosis can be the difference between confident commuting and an accident.\nMany of the symptoms of a bad brake power booster can be shared with other faulty parts. Determining if it\u2019s the booster, not something else, can be helped with these steps.\n\n1. Spray for leaks\n\nMix dish soap and water in a spray bottle. With the engine running, mist the brake booster all over, paying special attention to the seams, the hose, the check valve, and any other joins. If there\u2019s a leak, you can often see bubbles forming or water getting sucked in, identifying the source of the issue. You might also find that it\u2019s the brake booster hose that\u2019s collapsed or leaking rather than the brake booster itself.\n\n2. Check for brake assist\n\nFrom the driver\u2019s seat, drive your car around the block, then park it. Run the engine for 30 seconds without touching the brake pedal, then shut it off. Immediately press the brake pedal and notice how many presses it takes before the pedal gets hard. A good brake booster should still provide some assist for the first three or so applications.\n\n3. Test for boost on engine startup\n\nPress the pedal several times until you can feel that it\u2019s firm. That indicates that any vacuum in the booster has been discharged. With your foot on the brake pedal, fire up the engine. Notice if the pedal begins to get soft and drop under your foot. If it does, the brake power booster is likely not the culprit. But if it stays hard, then the booster could be bad.\n\n4. Confirm that there\u2019s vacuum\n\nThe symptoms could be indicating a bad brake booster, but it might be an issue of poor vacuum supply instead. With the engine off, remove the brake booster vacuum hose from the booster and fit a vacuum gauge to it. Start the engine, then watch for vacuum to build on the gauge. If it does, the booster is likely the issue, not the hose. If vacuum doesn\u2019t increase, it could be a bad hose or, worse yet, an issue on the engine side.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Replace a Brake Line Hose",
        "content": "What You Need\n\nThe parts and tools you\u2019ll need to get the job done will depend on your vehicle. You will need some or all of the following:\n\nWrench set\nRatchet and socket set\nLug nut wrench\nFloor jack\nWheel chocks\nBrake fluid\nNew brake hoses or lines\nPliers\nBrake cleaner\nEye protection\nBrake bleeder kit\nDrain pan\n\nOnce you have your materials and tools collected, you\u2019re ready to begin changing the brake hose.\n\nHow to Replace a Brake Line or Hose\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s the steel brake line that\u2019s damaged and needs to be replaced. They can corrode through from exposure to moisture and salt over many years, or they can get flattened by an impact that prevents fluid from flowing to back and forth. Also, if the connection with the brake hose is seized, you might need to replace a steel brake line along with the hose.\nThis is a more complex job than the hose itself, but the same principles will apply as swapping a hose alone. What makes it trickier is that brake lines need to snake through tight spaces a lot of the time, and their fairly rigid form can\u2019t be bent or it will damage it.\nIf you need to replace a brake line, pay close attention to how it comes out after disconnecting it. Then, route your new part into place following the same path.\n\nSteps to Replace a Brake Hose\n\nHowever, changing a brake hose can seem daunting, but it\u2019s a fairly straightforward job to complete. Follow these general steps to change out a brake line.\n\n1. Secure your vehicle\n\nSafety is incredibly important at every stage. Before beginning the job, park your vehicle on a flat surface, chock the wheels, and set the parking brake.\n\n2. Remove the wheel\n\nUsing your floor jack, lift the wheel or axle where the bad brake hose is. Secure it on jack stands for safety, then remove the wheel with your lug nut wrench. It\u2019s not compulsory to remove the wheel, but it adds a bunch of room to access the brake hose.\n\n3. Loosen the brake hose ends\n\nThe fasteners can be extremely tight on the brake hose. On one end, you might have a banjo bolt \u2013 that is, a 90-degree direction change that uses a hollow bolt \u2013 while the other end is usually a crimped-on threaded section. Using an appropriate wrench or a socket on a ratchet, crack the banjo bolt loose but don\u2019t remove it. On the other end, get the fastener moving from its tightened state.\n\n4. Disconnect the brake hose\n\nWith the fasteners loosened, remove the brake hose from the vehicle. Start at the end attached to the caliper, and to help prevent some of the mess, you can clamp the hose with pliers or vice grips near the end to stop fluid from leaking out. With the caliper end free, turn to the other side and unthread it. Have your new hose close by.\n\n5. Install the new brake hose\n\nOnce the old hose is removed, quickly work to install the new part. There will be some brake fluid slowly leaking from the brake line, so wear gloves to protect your skin. Thread the new brake hose onto the rigid steel line first, then connect the other end to your caliper or wheel cylinder. Make sure any washers or seals are in place. Tighten to the correct spec for your vehicle.\n\n6. Add brake fluid\n\nBefore going further, make sure there\u2019s still fluid in your brake fluid reservoir. Top it up with clean fluid from a new, sealed container.\n\n7. Bleed the brakes\n\nWith the new hose installed, you need to remove the air from the brake lines. Crack open the bleeder screw on the caliper or wheel cylinder to allow fluid to flow through, and have a friend press the brake pedal to force fluid into the line. While they hold the pedal down, tighten the bleeder screw to prevent it from pulling air back into the line. Repeat until there\u2019s only clean fluid coming out, and no air bubbles.\nTo be sure there isn\u2019t air introduced in any of the other lines, bleed the brakes at all four wheels. Spray off any fluid with brake cleaner.\n\n8. Install the wheel\n\nThen, install the wheel, lower your car, and start it. Press the brakes several times to pump them up, then carefully release your parking brake and take a test drive.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Brake Line Hose Replacement Costs",
        "content": "What impacts the cost of brake hose replacement?\n\nVirtually all brake hoses have a similar design. There\u2019s an exterior protective cover made from natural or synthetic rubber, a reinforced outer layer, a bonded adhesive layer, a second reinforced layer, and an inner lining that\u2019s made of EPDM or Teflon. The connector ends are crimped onto the hose. Some high-performance hoses also have braided stainless steel layers for added strength and style.\nWhat affects the price of a brake hose often comes down to a handful of factors:\n\nHose type \u2013 Depending on the type of vehicle, certain types of hoses may be required for replacement. For example, steel-braided hoses are more expensive than traditional rubber hoses. If you purchase higher quality hoses such as stainless steel or Kevlar reinforced, these will also come with an additional cost associated with them.\nVehicle make and model \u2013 The make and model of your vehicle can also influence the overall cost of replacing your brake hoses. Some models may include longer hoses or unique connections and routing which involve extra labor time, and therefore cost more to replace.\u00a0\nLocation \u2013 The hose location can also have an impact on the overall price you pay for replacement. For instance, a brake hose that\u2019s integrated with a steel line might need to be snaked into a tight spot, adding cost for materials and extra labor.\nInstallation \u2013 Generally speaking, it\u2019s always recommended to use a professional mechanic when replacing or repairing brake components. It\u2019s not only because they understand the safety considerations involved but also due to their expertise when dealing with brake systems which ultimately reduces installation costs. You can, however, do it on your own with the right tools.\n\nAverage brake hose replacement costs\n\nBrake hoses aren\u2019t universal, and the part you need for your vehicle will depend on the size, bore, burst strength, and connections, not to mention the materials used to make them. In most situations, these variables don\u2019t offer more choice; rather, they\u2019re specifications for making hoses that work for your vehicle. It does, however, affect the price you pay, whether you drive a passenger car, a truck, or an SUV.\n\nCars\n\nThe average light-duty passenger car might have a smaller bore of hose, and they\u2019re often relatively short sections. Access is easy to change them too. A brake hose replacement cost might range from around $65 to $250 between parts and labor per hose.\n\nTrucks\n\nWith heavy hauling capabilities, trucks will often have thicker hoses, and often they\u2019re slightly longer. It\u2019s not uncommon to pay between $107 and $380 per brake hose including installation costs.\n\nSUVs\n\nIn the middle of the range, SUVs need to be more robust than small cars but not necessarily at the same level as trucks. Pricing often ranges between $95 and $315.\n\nDIY vs professional brake hose installation costs\n\nNaturally, if you\u2019re a DIYer, then you could consider doing the work yourself to save on brake hose replacement cost. With only a connector at each end, the job isn\u2019t overly complex on its own. But aside from swapping out a brake hose, you\u2019ll need to add brake fluid and bleed the brakes, getting out any air that got into the system. Otherwise, the brakes will be inconsistent and spongy, and they might not stop your vehicle like you expect them to.\nIf you decide to change the hose on your own, ensure you have a second person on hand to help with bleeding the brakes, or purchase a brake bleeder kit. And always use the same type of brake fluid that your owner\u2019s manual specifies for top-ups.\nTypically, labor is the largest component of the job, and there\u2019s a level of confidence and peace of mind you\u2019ll get from having a professional technician install the hose. Labor costs range from around $60 to $190 or so per hose, but you can save on those costs if you do it yourself.\n\nTips to minimize the cost of replacing brake hoses\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to minimize brake line replacement cost, here are a few tips:\n\nShop around for a competitively-priced mechanic, but always ensure they\u2019re ASE-certified.\nInstall the brake hose yourself.\nFind an aftermarket hose instead of buying the OEM replacement part.\nRoute and secure your new hose carefully, otherwise it could rub through and need premature replacement.\nReplace a worn or cracked brake hose before it leaks. That way, you\u2019ll have more control over the replacement part selection and pricing.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Brake Caliper Buying Guide",
        "content": "Different styles of brake calipers\n\nThere are several different types of calipers used in cars. Here\u2019s an overview of some of the more common ones.\n\nFloating caliper\n\nThis type of caliper slides or floats back and forth on pins. The caliper bracket attaches firmly, not the caliper itself. When the piston extends, it pushes the inboard pad against the rotor, and the pressure causes the caliper to float inward, pulling the outboard pad against the rotor. It\u2019s common and comparatively inexpensive, but it\u2019s not intended for extreme driving.\n\nFixed caliper\n\nA fixed is rigidly mounted to the wheel knuckle over a portion of the rotor. It contains pistons that oppose each other, and brake pads fit into either side. When the pedal is pressed, both pistons extend evenly for dependable stopping power. They\u2019re a more costly component, but they perform better in strenuous situations.\n\nSliding caliper\n\nA variation of the floating caliper, this style also commonly uses a single piston. The pads are mounted in a caliper adapter rather that resembles a fixed caliper, and they slide on pins to clamp against the rotor. It\u2019s more dependable for even braking applications but they have more service points that could cause issues.\n\nFour-piston caliper\n\nThis design utilizes four pistons arranged in two pairs, with each pair located on either side of the rotor. It\u2019s a variation of the fixed caliper. The advantage here is that all four pistons can adjust separately, providing more control over your brakes and helping to minimize brake fade in high-performance vehicles. The downsides are cost and availability since they\u2019re not offered on all makes and models.\n\nFactors to Consider When Buying Brake Calipers\n\nWhen it comes to buying brake calipers, there are several important factors you need to consider to ensure that you purchase the right product. Here are some tips on what to look out for.\n\nBudget \u2013 Determine how much money you have available and what type of brake caliper fits within your budget. You don\u2019t necessarily have to purchase the most expensive parts available, but make sure that you buy something that will last.\nCompatibility \u2013 Ensure that the brake calipers are suitable for your vehicle by checking their compatibility with your car\u2019s make and model. Most of the time, the wrong part won\u2019t bolt up at all, keeping your car out of service even longer.\nQuality \u2013 Choose parts from a brand name you know and trust, has excellent reviews, and is backed by warranty for your peace of mind.\nDriving style \u2013 Different driving styles require different types of brakes. For example, if you drive often in aggressive or performance conditions, you may benefit from upgraded calipers such as six-piston calipers.\nMaterial. Given a choice, cast iron calipers are strong and cost-effective, but aluminum calipers and newer thermoplastic calipers offer reduced weight and corrosion resistance.\n\nConsiderations When Upgrading to Performance Brake Calipers\n\nUpgrading a brake caliper\nBefore you start searching for performance brake calipers on your vehicle, there are a few things you should pause on. First, are you prepared for the cost? Upgrading to performance parts comes at a price, with calipers often being double the OEM replacements.\nSecondly, consider the maintenance requirements. If you\u2019re using your car for performance driving, the brake fluid should be changed more frequently to start with. Then, the performance brake calipers will operate best using performance pads and rotors too, and they\u2019re more costly than stock parts also. It could easily triple your costs of brake repairs.\nAlso, remember that brake pressures are delicately balanced between the front and rear brakes. If you\u2019re replacing calipers with performance parts, you really should do all four.\nFinally, is an upgrade necessary? Most carmakers match a vehicle\u2019s calipers quite well to their application. Unless you\u2019ve added horsepower and torque, upgraded your suspension, and implemented weight-reduction techniques, you might be best sticking with OEM-style parts.\n\nHow to choose the right size brake caliper for your vehicle\n\nWhen you\u2019re working on the braking system, you need to be careful that parts are designed to fit exactly. The wrong caliper won\u2019t line up with the mounting holes on the knuckle, might be designed for a different rotor depth, or the rotor won\u2019t fit within it.\nFind the correct parts to replace or upgrade your calipers by shopping according to your specific vehicle. That ensures the brake hose connection will be in the right place, it will mount properly, and the caliper will fit with your car\u2019s brake rotor size, among other things.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask\n\nHelpful Brake Caliper and Braking System Resources",

Check along the flexible rubber edge of each wiper blade for nicks and cuts. If you see damage, or if your wipers leave streaks behind after a pass, replace them both.\n\nInspect and top up the fluids\u00a0\n\nInspect and top fluids\nFluids can have moisture intrude or form from cycles between hot and cold temperatures. Contamination can occur, and oils can break down and lose viscosity.

Also, top up the windshield washer fluid.\n\nCheck the air filters\n\nCheck the air filters\nAlthough dust storms and bugs aren\u2019t the norm in the winter, the air still carries particles that will get caught in the air filters. Inspect the engine air filter as well as the cabin air filter to ensure they aren\u2019t coated in debris. Check that light passes through the pleats, indicating that air can still make its way through efficiently too. If the filters are dirty, smelly, or you can\u2019t see light through them, replace them. It\u2019s usually necessary every year as part of your vehicle maintenance schedule.\n\nTest the battery\n\nTest the Battery\n\nCheck the brakes\n\nCheck the brakes\nAs summer approaches, your brakes will need to be in good condition to bring your vehicle to a halt, and higher temperatures can cause brake pads and rotors to wear a little faster too. Make sure you\u2019re starting the season out right and that your brake pads have at least 3/16ths of an inch remaining at each wheel for both the inboard and outboard pad. Brake rotors shouldn\u2019t be gouged, and they shouldn\u2019t have ridges or pockmarks of rust on either side. If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process. Spark plugs, ignition cables, and fluid flushes may be due. It\u2019s best to follow the maintenance schedule provided by the manufacturer for major services.\nIf you complete the items on this spring car checklist, you\u2019ll help minimize the overall cost of repairs and prevent untimely issues from occurring.

        "title": "How to Replace a Brake Caliper\u00a0",
        "content": "How a brake caliper works\u00a0\n\nWhen the brake pedal is pressed, brake fluid is forced through the brake lines and into the brake caliper. The brake fluid pressurizes the caliper, causing a piston or pistons to move outwards. As the piston or pistons move outwards, they push the brake pads against the brake rotors. The brake pads create friction with the rotors, slowing or stopping the vehicle. When the brake pedal is released, the brake fluid pressure is relieved, allowing the piston or pistons to return to their original position and releasing the brake pads from the rotors.\u00a0\nThere are two main types of brake calipers: sliding calipers and fixed calipers. Sliding calipers have a single piston that moves back and forth to apply pressure to the brake pads, while fixed calipers have multiple pistons that move outward to apply pressure to the pads. Both types of calipers are designed to apply equal pressure to both brake pads, ensuring that the vehicle stops evenly.\u00a0\n\nHow to recognize symptoms of a bad brake caliper\u00a0\n\nSeveral symptoms may indicate a problem with a brake caliper:\u00a0\n\nSquealing or grinding noises when braking \u2013 If you hear a loud, high-pitched noise when you apply the brakes, it could be a sign of a problem with the brake caliper. The noise may be caused by a stuck caliper or a worn brake pad.\u00a0\n\nBrake pedal feels spongy or soft \u2013 If the brake pedal feels soft or spongy when you press down on it, it could be caused by a brake fluid leak, which could also cause the brake pedal to feel hard or firm.\u00a0\nBrake pads are worn unevenly \u2013 If one brake pad is wearing down faster than the other, the brake caliper may not be applying equal pressure to both brake pads, causing one pad to wear down faster than the other.\u00a0\nBrake warning light is on \u2013 If the brake warning light on your dashboard is illuminated, it could indicate a problem with the brake caliper, typically a leak that results in low fluid.\u00a0\nVehicle pulls to one side when braking \u2013 If your vehicle seems to pull to one side when you apply the brakes, the caliper may not be applying equal pressure to both brake pads, causing the vehicle to pull to one side.\u00a0\n\nAs well, if you notice excessive heat emanating from the rotor or wheel after going for a drive, it\u2019s a sign the caliper is seized.\u00a0\n\nTools you need for the job\u00a0\n\nYou will need:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA lug wrench\u00a0\nJack and jack stands\u00a0\nA brake caliper tool\u00a0\nTorque wrench\u00a0\nC-clamp\u00a0\nA brake hose wrench\u00a0\nA brake bleeding kit\u00a0\nAnd, of course, a new brake caliper.\u00a0\n\nWhen you\u2019re replacing a caliper, always top up the brake fluid using the correct spec indicated on the reservoir cap, and only from a new, unopened container.\u00a0\nSteps to replace a brake caliper\n\nIf you are comfortable with car repairs and have the necessary tools, you can replace the brake caliper yourself. The process might vary slightly for different makes and models. Here are the general steps to replace a brake caliper.\u00a0\n\n1. Lift the vehicle\n\nUse the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the tire and then use the jack to lift the vehicle off the ground. Secure the vehicle with jack stands. \n\n2. Remove the tire\n\nUse the lug wrench to remove the lug nuts and then remove the tire from the vehicle.\n\n3. Remove the caliper mounting bolts\n\nUse the brake caliper tool to remove the caliper mounting bolts that hold the caliper in place. \n\n4.

        "title": "How Long Do Brake Pads Last?",
        "content": "Understanding Brake Pad Lifespan\n\nBrake pads are designed to generate friction when you press the brake pedal, and as they rub against the brake rotor, the softer compound the pad is made of has a microscopic layer that rubs away every time. The average lifespan can be under 20,000 miles or more than 60,000 miles for the front brakes, and much longer for the rears. And in that wide range, there are a variety of factors that determine how soon you\u2019ll need to change your brakes:\n\nDriving habits \u2013 How you drive plays a pivotal role in the lifespan of your brake pads. Aggressive driving and frequent abrupt stops can significantly accelerate wear and tear. Conversely, adopting a smoother and more gradual braking style contributes to an extended lifespan.\nMaterial composition \u2013 A range of materials are available for brake pads, each offering distinct characteristics impacting how long they last. Organic, semi-metallic, and ceramic pads are prevalent choices, and understanding their traits helps in making an informed selection.\nEnvironmental conditions \u2013 External elements such as weather and road conditions exert an influence on brake pad wear. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, as well as challenging terrains, can speed degradation.\nVehicle weight \u2013 The weight is a crucial determinant. Heavier vehicles tend to exert more force on the braking system, accelerating wear. You can expect mor frequent service intervals.\n\nHow to Identify Wear and Tear on Brake Pads\n\nRecognizing the telltale signs of wear on your brake pads is essential for the overall safety of your vehicle. Conducting regular visual inspections is an important aspect of brake pad maintenance. Checking for visible signs of wear, including measuring the pad thickness, allows for timely intervention when nearing the minimum limit. When the material is less than 4/32nds of an inch remaining at the thinnest part, change the pads.\nAn audible cue to potential issues, squeaking or grinding noises while braking often indicate worn-out brake pads. Addressing these warnings promptly can prevent further damage to other brake components. Any noticeable decrease in braking efficiency or an increase in stopping distance should serve as a clear indicator that your brake pads require attention.\nMany modern vehicles are equipped with electronic wear indicators. Monitoring the warning lights on your dashboard can provide an early indication of impending brake pad replacement.\n\nMaximizing Brake Pad Durability\n\nAdopting proactive measures for brake pad maintenance is essential to extend their lifespan and ensure optimal performance.\n\nRoutine visual inspections should become a habit for every car owner. Identifying and addressing issues promptly can prevent further damage and reduce the overall cost of maintenance.\nEmbracing a smooth and gradual braking style is not only safer but also contributes to reducing unnecessary wear on your brake pads. This practice is particularly beneficial for city driving and daily commuting.\nThe importance of using high-quality brake fluid cannot be overstated. Opting for a reputable brake fluid brand helps maintain the efficiency of your entire braking system, including the brake pads.\nPeriodically lubricating the contact points between the brake pads and calipers can prevent unnecessary friction, reducing wear and noise.\nUse cruise control for a consistent speed, helping to reduce brake applications to correct your speed.\n\nChoosing the Right Brake Pads for Your Driving Style\n\nSelecting the appropriate brake pads based on your driving habits and conditions is a pivotal decision that directly impacts their lifespan and performance.\n\nFor city driving and daily commuting, ceramic brake pads may be a suitable choice due to their quieter operation and lower dust production. They offer a balance between performance and comfort.\nEnthusiastic drivers or those engaging in performance driving might find semi-metallic brake pads to be the optimal choice. These pads offer enhanced stopping power, catering to more demanding driving conditions.\nFor passenger car owners who are budget-conscious, consider organic brake pads that are quiet and easy to apply but might not last quite as long as other options.\nIf your driving routine involves frequent towing or carrying heavy loads, considering heavy-duty or semi-metallic brake pads becomes imperative. These pads are designed to withstand the additional stress associated with such activities.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Signs of Warped Rotors\u00a0",
        "content": "What Is a Warped Rotor?\u00a0\n\nA brake rotor is designed to look like a wide-brimmed hat. The center of the hat, or the face of the rotor, is centered on the wheel studs and/or the axle hub flange. The \u2018brim\u2019 is the rotor\u2019s working surface, and it\u2019s a perfectly flat, hardened steel surface where the pads press against when the caliper squeezes closed. Some brake rotors have a ventilated section between the inner and outer surfaces to dissipate heat, as is the case with front brake rotors. Most rear brake rotors are a solid surface without ventilation.\u00a0\nBut if the rotor has lateral runout, meaning that the surface is no longer completely flat and true as it passes between the brake pads, it\u2019s considered to be warped. To put it into perspective, you might begin to feel the symptoms of warped rotors with as little as 2/1000ths-inch of runout.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy do Brake Rotors Warp?\u00a0\n\nGenerally, brake rotors don\u2019t actually get hot enough to warp from the heat alone. Rather, what happens are a few conditions that change the rotor\u2019s contact surfaces to cause the uneasy feeling of warpage.\u00a0\u00a0\nSevere heat conditions are one of the main reasons that rotors warp, but it\u2019s not because the rotor\u2019s shape distorts as you\u2019d think. When brakes get very hot, the rotor\u2019s surface actually softens. Then, when the brakes are applied, the brake rotor surface wears down in areas of lower density rather than the brake pad getting worn. It results in disc thickness variation, and some spots are physically thinner than others on the rotor. When the brake pedal is pressed, the caliper piston moves in and out at a rapid pace to compensate for variances. Sometimes you\u2019ll see bluing on the rotor face.\u00a0\nThe second reason for the feeling of warped rotors is that the rotors are glazed. This happens when brake pads and rotors have reached extreme temperatures and the pad material has become embedded into or coated portions of the rotor. These areas have a differing amount of friction than normal, so it gives the feeling of a warped rotor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSigns of a Warped Brake Rotor\u00a0\n\nIf you have one or more warped brake rotors, there are a few common symptoms you\u2019re likely going to detect.\u00a0\nBrake pedal vibration. When you press the brake pedal, it can feel like chattering through the pedal that varies with your vehicle speed. The higher your rate of speed, the faster the vibration\u2019s frequency. It\u2019s common to feel brake pedal vibration when any brake rotor is warped, whether at a front or rear wheel.\u00a0Vibration through the steering wheel. Especially for warped rotors on the front wheels, you could feel a vibration that jitters the steering wheel side to side.\u00a0\u00a0Noises while braking. You might hear a rhythmic groaning or thumping noise when you brake. It\u2019s due to an uneven surface for the brake pads to apply against.\u00a0Failing or sticking calipers. If rotors are warped, the additional strain on calipers to compensate can cause them to fail.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow to Replace a Warped Rotor\u00a0\n\nChanging a warped brake rotor is one of the simpler DIY repairs you may take on. It\u2019s non-intrusive and usually takes around an hour to change both of the brake rotors on an axle. The process varies depending on the vehicle you drive, but generally, these are the steps.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Lift and secure your vehicle\n\nLift the affected wheels off the ground and secure them on jack stands. If need be, you can lift one wheel at a time to complete the job. Make sure to set the parking brake and chock the wheels.\n\n2. Remove the wheel\n\nLoosen and remove the lug nuts, then take the wheel off the hub and set it to the side.\n\n3. Remove the caliper and bracket\n\nFind the appropriate socket or wrench and remove the brake caliper. Suspend it with a strap or bungee cord so it isn\u2019t hanging from the brake hose.\n\n4. Remove the rotor\n\nThere may be clips on the rotor to remove first, which a pair of sidecutters is perfect for. Then, get the rotor off. Most rotors will slide off the wheel studs without much effort, although some need to be removed using a puller or by whacking the face of the rotor with a hammer to dislodge it.\n\n5. Install the new rotor\n\nClean the new brake rotor with brake cleaner and wipe it dry with a lint-free cloth. Then, slide it onto the wheel studs until it\u2019s firmly against the wheel hub flange. It\u2019s the perfect time to install new brake pads too. Check the brake fluid level and top it up from a new container, if necessary.\n\n6. Assemble\n\nInstall the brake caliper and the wheel, tightening each to the correct torque spec. Then, lower the car to the ground. Pump up the brake pedal until it\u2019s firm, then start the engine and press the brake pedal a few times until it feels normal. Then, carefully road test to ensure the brakes are operating as designed.",

        "title": "What is Brake Fade and What Causes It?\u00a0",
        "content": "What Is Brake Fade?\u00a0\n\nBrake fade is an unexpected reduction in braking performance. When you press the brake pedal, you\u2019ll notice that it takes longer for your car to come to a stop than you\u2019re used to. Usually, there\u2019s an increase in effort on the pedal to achieve the stopping power you need.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt the need to press the brake pedal with both feet after driving down a hill, your car is creeping forward in traffic when you\u2019re trying to hold it at a stop, or it feels like your pedal is spongy and travels further to the floor, you\u2019ve experienced brake fade.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe unpredictability of brake fade can result in performing a brake inspection or taking it to the shop to have your brakes checked, but there typically aren\u2019t any noticeable problems. And after the car sits for awhile, your brakes will work normally \u2013 once they cool down. Then, after driving under just the right conditions, it might happen again.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat Causes Brake Fade?\u00a0\n\nBrake fade can be frustrating to diagnose. What causes brake fade? There are actually three distinct reasons for the exact same symptom.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPad fade\u00a0\n\nThe most common cause for brake fade is from overheating due to friction on the brake pads. It\u2019s what happens when the heat generated by braking can\u2019t dissipate well before subsequent brake applications. Temperatures on the brake pads normally stay below 400 degrees Fahrenheit, but it\u2019s possible with prolonged or extreme use for the temperatures to exceed 700 F.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor standard-duty brakes, the binder or resin in the friction material can begin to melt. When that happens, it behaves as a fluid or lubricant between the brake pad and the rotor, and they don\u2019t grab like they should on application. When the brakes cool, the binder can harden and adhere as a microscopic layer on the pads and rotors, and anytime there are higher than normal temperatures, the condition can resurface.\u00a0\n\nFluid fade\u00a0\n\nThe common types of brake fluid used in passenger vehicles, DOT 3 and DOT 4, have a dry boiling point of 401 F and 446 F respectively. But when the fluid does boil, little bubbles form in the fluid that compresses much easier than liquid, causing a spongy brake pedal and brake fade.\u00a0\nIt isn\u2019t normal for fluid fade to occur with new fluid because of the tolerance for high temperatures. However, brake fluid is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs water vapor to prevent corrosion inside the system. When the brake fluid has absorbed moisture and contains 3.7% water, it boils at a much lower temperature. This is known as the wet boiling point. Under heavy braking conditions, it\u2019s possible to reach the wet boiling point in the brake lines. That\u2019s when fluid fade occurs.\u00a0\n\nGreen fade\u00a0\n\nGases are trapped in the friction material during manufacturing. When these gases are released as the brake pads get hot, they create a buffer between the friction layer and the brake rotor. Essentially, it\u2019s the same premise as a car hydroplaning on a wet highway, and the pads can\u2019t get enough grip on the rotor.\u00a0\u00a0\nSeldom will green fade become evident anymore as manufacturing criteria and materials used are much higher quality than they used to be. But it can still happen, and when it does, it feels like the car won\u2019t stop no matter how hard to press the brake pedal.\u00a0\nGreen fade tends to dissipate after the brake pads have come up to temperature a few times and off-gassing has been completed.\u00a0\n\nHow to Prevent Brake Fade\u00a0\n\nIt might seem like a problem you\u2019re unlikely to encounter, yet you\u2019ll keep it that way by preventative measures, whether you\u2019re aware of it or not.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Change the brake fluid around every two years\n\nBoth DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluids can absorb up to 2% moisture content in a single year. Reaching the 3.7% threshold for the wet boiling point can occur in under 24 months. While that doesn\u2019t assure brake fade will happen, it\u2019s more likely to occur.\n\n2. Use the appropriate rotors for your performance\n\nTo avoid friction fade, it\u2019s imperative to keep your brakes within normal operating temperatures.  If you plan to race, tow heavy loads, or otherwise tax your braking system regularly, disperse as much heat as possible by ensuring you have good-quality rotors installed. Slotted or drilled rotors can help reduce temperatures at the brake pads. \n\n3. Break in new brake pads\n\nTo avoid green fade, get any gases in the friction material to release under controlled conditions. It\u2019s often done by riding the brakes immediately after installing new pads to get them very hot. It\u2019s best to follow the manufacturer\u2019s break-in procedure, though.",

        "title": "What does a full brake job entail?",
        "content": "Generally, replacing a set of brake pads and rotors averages $255 if you buy the parts and install them yourself. Here\u2019s what the job looks like if you tackle it on your own.\n\nHow to do a full brake job\n\nAll the steps to do a complete brake job can be repeated for each wheel on your vehicle. Read on for a quick guide to replacing your brakes and always remember that when working with brake fluid you should use eye protection and gloves.\n\n1. Remove some brake fluid\n\nOpen the brake fluid reservoir and if it is full remove some of the fluid so that it doesn\u2019t spill out during the brake job.\n\n2. Give yourself room to work\n\nJack up the vehicle at the wheel you will be working on, make sure to use jack stands to support the weight of the vehicle, and remove the wheel.\n\n3. Get the caliper out of the way\n\nTake off the caliper and suspend it using a zip tie or bungee so that the brake hose does not kink.\n\n4. Take the brake pads out\n\nRemove the brake pads, taking note of the position of the wear sensor. The wear sensor, often called a squealer tab, is a small metal tab on one side of the brake pad.\n\n5. Remove and replace the rotor if required\n\nIf there is uneven wear on the rotor, remove and replace the rotor as well. Taking off the rotors may require you to remove a caliper mounting bracket, and some rotors even have a screw that needs to be taken out in order to remove the rotor. Note that sometimes rotors can be stuck on pretty well, and you may need to use some penetrating fluid or a mallet to persuade it.\n\n6. Prep your parts and surfaces\n\nClean any mounting surfaces that have even a small amount of rust on them with a wire brush, in order to ensure a perfect fit.\n\n7. Install your new brakes\n\nInstall the new parts in the reverse order that you removed the original equipment. Make sure to lubricate any brake pad hardware so that it can slide freely on the guides and when you reinstall the caliper, you will need to use a caliper spreader to push the piston back. Note that some caliper pistons need to be screwed in, so check to see what style yours are before you do this step.\n\n8. Top up the brake fluid\n\nOnce all the parts are reinstalled, check your brake fluid level and top it up, if needed. Gently pump the brakes to restore brake pressure to the wheel and then check the fluid level again before sealing the reservoir.\n\n9. Check the operation\n\nReplace the wheel and take the vehicle for a test drive.\n\nWhat parts and tools will you need?\n\nIn order to complete this repair, you will want to have the following parts and tools on hand to make the job go smoothly.\n\nBrake parts\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious parts, including a set of quality brake pads and a rotor. Another part that may need replacing is the caliper, if you find that the piston has seized, seals are damaged, or if leaks are coming from it. You should also have a small bottle of brake fluid to top up the reservoir and a tube of silicone-based brake lubricant to lubricate all the brake hardware.\n\nTools\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned some of the safety gear that you will want to use, like gloves and safety glasses, but here are some other tools that you will require to complete this job:\n\nFloor jack and jack stands\nWrenches\nRatchet set\nScrewdrivers\nAllen/Hex keys\nCaliper Spreader\nTorque wrench\n\nDo I need to replace my brake caliper?\n\nThe brake caliper has some o-rings and a dust boot that keep the brake fluid from leaking out and dust from entering the piston. The brake fluid not only compresses the piston to actuate the brakes, but it also serves to lubricate all of the parts inside the caliper so that it operates flawlessly. If the dust boot is damaged and grit or moisture gets into the piston area, it can cause the piston to rust and seize, or just become difficult to move.\nIf you notice that the dust boot on your caliper is damaged, then you should consider replacing the caliper. In the past, many folks rebuilt their own calipers, but modern rebuilt calipers are inexpensive enough that most people simply replace the entire unit.\n\nHow much does a full brake job cost?\n\nIf you are willing to do the work yourself, you can typically get a set of brake pads for $25-$100 per axle (per axle refers to both front wheels or both rear wheels). Rotors are sold individually, at a cost of between $50 and $180 per rotor, depending on the vehicle and part grade.\nThat adds up to a price of between $125 and $460 per axle, which is quite the range in price for new brake pads and rotors. If you need new calipers too, that can also add between $50 and $350 per caliper.\nAdding all the parts up may seem like a huge cost, but when you consider what\u2019s at stake, it\u2019s really worth it. Also, remember that a set of brake pads should last between 30,000 and 70,000 miles or more, so it\u2019s a long-term investment in your safety.\nGet all the parts you need to replace your brakes at AutoZone, and remember to make use of the Loan-A-Tool program for tools that you don\u2019t have in your toolbox.",

        "title": "How long do brake rotors last?",
        "content": "What Is a Brake Rotor?\n\nBrake rotors on most vehicles are about the size of a dinner plate and made out of steel. They are bolted to the wheel hub and the brake caliper sits over top of them, with a pair of brake pads seated on either side of the rotor in the caliper.\u00a0\nWhen you press the brake in your car you force the master brake cylinder to compress brake fluid into the brake caliper and that pressure pushes the brake pads together using the pistons in the caliper. The friction between the brake pads, which wear down over time, pressing against the steel brake rotor causes the rotor to slow down and eventually stop the vehicle.\n\nHow Long Do Rotors Last?\n\nThe whole system is designed so that the brake pads endure the bulk of the punishment during stopping procedures. Eventually, though, the friction on the brake rotors that comes from the breaking process can wear out the steel, reducing the rotors\u2019 ability to resist warping. Drivers who are very gentle on the brakes and do a lot of highway driving can often have rotors that last for 60,000 miles, but city driving, and especially stop and start or jackrabbit driving, punishes the brakes and can lead to warping as early as 20,000 miles.\nNewer vehicles also tend to have thinner rotors from the factory, since rotors are made out of steel and can be very heavy, and manufacturers are working hard to reduce the weight in their vehicles and improve fuel economy. This means that newer rotors will tend to have less resistance to warping and will tend to wear out faster.\n\nWhen Should You Replace Your Brake Rotors?\n\nHow can you tell when to replace rotors? There are some signs of bad rotors that you can look out for, including:\nPulsing in the brakes. If you notice a pulsing sensation in the brakes when you are undergoing breaking in your car, that may be a sign that you have a warped rotor.\u00a0Very heavy grooves or damage to the rotor. Removing your vehicle\u2019s wheels will allow you to do a visual inspection of the rotors and other brake components. If you notice that there are deep grooves, scoring, or cracks in the rotor, that will quickly cause damage to brake pads, even brand-new brake pads. You should do a brake rotor and pad change in this situation.Grinding noises or feelings when braking. If you can feel or hear grinding noises when you are braking, that is also a signal that you have potential issues with your brake rotors and you should do a visual inspection.Longer braking distances or inconsistent braking. A worn-out set of rotors can cause your breaking distances to lengthen, which it\u2019s a safety issue that should be dealt with immediately.\nIt\u2019s important to note that when you do a brake rotor replacement, you should also replace all of the brake pads associated with that rotor. Replacing a rotor without replacing the brake pads can lead to premature damage to the rotor and brake pads are not expensive to replace, so it makes sense to replace them at the same time.\nAlways replace rotors and brake pads on both sides of the vehicle at the same time, so do all the front brakes or all the rear brakes together. For instance, if you replace only the passenger front rotors and brake pads, you may experience inconsistent and dangerous braking.\n\nWhat is an Air Brake Rotor, and How do You Replace them?\u00a0\n\nPassenger cars and light trucks typically use hydraulic brake systems, but larger commercial vehicles and especially heavy-duty trucks tend to have air brakes. One of the differences between hydraulic brakes and air brakes is that the rotor and caliper in an air brake system will be further inboard on the axle of the vehicle than the corresponding rotor and caliper in a hydraulic brake system. The mechanism of calipers and brake pads acting to create friction with the rotor is similar in both systems.\nReplacing an air brake rotor requires the mechanic to remove the wheel, ABS sensor, and head unit from the spindle on the axle. Once the head unit is free, loosen the bolts connecting the head unit and the rotor and when reinstalling the new rotor, be sure to use new, clean bolts and torque them to manufacturer specifications.\n\nCan I Replace the Rotors on My Car?\n\nFAQ",

        "title": "How Much Does it Cost to Change Brake Fluid?\u00a0",
        "content": "The Cost to Change Brake Fluid\n\nThe average car will use about a quart of brake fluid to flush the system, so the cost will be between $10 and $20 for the brake fluid. If you decide to take your car to the mechanic instead, the labor can range from about $50 to $100 in addition to the fluid. Generally, a brake fluid flush is around $100 when you have a shop do it for you.\u00a0\n\nWhat Does Brake Fluid Do?\u00a0\n\nThe term hydraulic comes from the word hydro, which means water in Greek, and in modern usage, it pertains to anything using a fluid to do work. The hydraulic brake system on your vehicle uses brake fluid to compress brake pads against rotors at the wheels, slowing and stopping the car. The fluid is pressurized in the master cylinder of the vehicle when you step on the brake and sent to the calipers at each wheel through a system of pipes and hoses.\u00a0\nFor almost 100 years, brake systems in cars have relied on the pressure from the driver\u2019s foot to actuate the master cylinder, but in recent years brake by wire technology has been developed, and now more vehicles are seeing a change to electronically actuated master cylinders.\u00a0\n\nWhat are the Different Types of Brake Fluid?\u00a0\n\nThere are four different types of brake fluid available, and they all use the prefix DOT, standing for Department of Transportation, in their naming conventions. This is because the DOT maintains standards for their quality and safety through regulation of specifications.\u00a0\n\nDOT 3 brake fluid is a glycol-based fluid that has a dry boiling point of 401 degrees F and a wet boiling point of 284 degrees F. We\u2019ll explain why that matters in the next paragraph.\u00a0\nDOT 4 brake fluid is also glycol-based, with a dry boiling point of 446 degrees F and a wet boiling point of 311 degrees F.\u00a0\nDOT 5.1 brake fluid is glycol-based, with a dry boiling point of 500 degrees F and a wet boiling point of 365 degrees F.\u00a0\nDOT 5 brake fluid is silicone-based, so it is incompatible with any of the other types of brake fluid! It has the same boiling points as DOT 5.1 brake fluid. You cannot use DOT 5 fluid in a car that calls for any other type.\u00a0\n\nWhy do Brake Fluid Boiling Points Matter?\u00a0\n\nThe dry boiling points are measured with fluid that has not been exposed to the atmosphere and has not absorbed any moisture. The wet boiling points are measured using a fluid that has been contaminated with 3.7% water.\u00a0\nAll the glycol-based brake fluid types can absorb water, when you open the brake fluid filler cap, through rubber hoses, or worn seals. Heavy braking can cause your brake rotors, pads, and calipers to heat up, even to the point of boiling the moisture in the brake fluid. When the moisture in the brake fluid boils and turns into a gas it can reduce the ability of this system to pressurize the brakes and can lead to brake fade.\u00a0\nFor this reason, it\u2019s the wet boiling points of the fluids that matter, because they represent the real-world temperatures at which the fluids can still be effective.\u00a0\n\nWhich Type of Brake Fluid Should I Use?\u00a0\n\nAlways consult the owner\u2019s manual for your vehicle to determine the correct fluids for use in your brake system. It may even indicate on the top of the brake fluid filler cap as to which fluid you need to use for your particular vehicle. Most vehicles will use either DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid.\u00a0\n\nHow Often Should I Change the Brake Fluid in My Car?\u00a0\n\nA brake fluid change is part of the normal maintenance schedule of every vehicle because as moisture continues to enter the fluid it becomes less effective, and it can eventually wear out. For most passenger cars, a brake fluid change interval of every two years works very well. If you take your car to the track or live in a mountainous region where the brakes take a lot of punishment, you may consider changing the brake fluid once a year or more.\u00a0\nWhen it\u2019s time to do your brake flush, get all your brake fluid at AutoZone, as well as tools and any other parts that you need to keep your car on the road.",

        "title": "What Color Is Brake Fluid?",
        "content": "What Is Brake Fluid?\n\nBrake fluid is a hydraulic fluid. When you press down on the brake pedal, it transfers that force to the calipers or wheel cylinders. That movement creates pressure in the brake lines, and that\u2019s what moves the pistons. The pistons push the pads or shoes against the rotors or drums to create friction and stop your car. It\u2019s a non-compressible fluid, which is why it\u2019s so effective in the brake system.\nBrake fluid also has another important job. It lubricates and protects the parts of your braking system from corrosion. It\u2019s known as a hygroscopic fluid, which means that it traps moisture molecules so they can\u2019t corrode parts internally like the brake lines and calipers, which could cause an unexpected brake problem down the line.\n\nWhat Does Brake Fluid Look Like?\n\nBrake fluid is usually a clear, amber, bluish, red, or greenish color when it comes out of the container and it\u2019s new in the system. You can see it in the transparent reservoir in your engine compartment where you add brake fluid.\nBut brake fluid can also be brown or black. And that\u2019s not good. Black brake fluid means it\u2019s time to change it. When the brake fluid darkens, it\u2019s a sign that there are contaminants in the system, whether that\u2019s moisture, dirt, or particles that have worn off the inside of components during use.\n\nDifferent Types of Brake Fluid\n\nThere are two main types of brake fluid: DOT 3 and DOT 4. They\u2019re both glycol-based fluids, but DOT 3 has a lower boiling point than DOT 4. That means it breaks down faster and needs to be changed more often \u2013 every 20,000 miles or so. DOT 4 can last up to 60,000 miles before it needs to be replaced.\nThere are also DOT 5 and DOT 5.1 fluids available. DOT 5 is silicone-based and typically used only for classic cars and other niche applications. DOT 5.1 has a much higher boiling point of around 500F and it\u2019s compatible with both DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids, where all other types should not be interchanged. Like other car fluid colors, brake fluid specs determine how it appears when new.\n\nDOT 3 fluid might appear as a faint yellow, blue, red, or green shade.\nDOT 4 fluid is mostly clear but could have a tinge of yellow or deep red.\nDOT 5 often appears purple.\nDOT 5.1 brake fluid could be yellow, blue, or crystal clear.\n\nHow to Check Your Brake Fluid\n\nHow to check and top off your brake fluid\nIt\u2019s easy to check your brake fluid level and condition. Just open the hood and find the transparent reservoir. The level of brake fluid should be between the \u201cmin\u201d and \u201cmax\u201d lines on the side of the reservoir. If it\u2019s below the \u201cmin\u201d line, you need to add more brake fluid.\nIf the fluid is a darker color than honey brown, it\u2019s getting old or contaminated, and flushing it out should be on your radar. You can also rub a drop of brake fluid between your fingers. If it feels at all gritty, there\u2019s a problem and it needs to be changed before it causes a failure inside.\nNow you know all about brake fluid \u2013 what color is it, what it does, and how to check. Keep an eye on that brake fluid level and change it when it starts to look black. Your brakes will thank you!",

        "title": "OEM vs Aftermarket Brake Pads: What\u2019s the Right Choice?",
        "content": "What are OEM brake pads?\n\nThe acronym OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer, and it refers to parts that are made by your car\u2019s manufacturer and are precisely the same as the ones it was equipped with off the factory assembly line. They\u2019re often supplied to the OEM from another parts manufacturer, though, according to the specs your carmaker indicates.\u00a0\nFor OEM brake pads, certain qualities are quite common, and they\u2019re almost all focused on the initial experience when you buy a car. The carmaker wants you to enjoy driving \u2013 including stopping \u2013 your car, with as little to complain about as possible. For most applications, they\u2019re made of either ceramic or organic compounds to achieve these smooth-braking results.\n\nWhat are aftermarket brake pads?\n\nWhen you hear \u2018aftermarket\u2019, you might think of parts that are made to simulate the original parts, perhaps with a focus on lower prices. While that\u2019s sometimes true, aftermarket brake pads are simply parts that have been designed for your vehicle that are NOT made by the vehicle manufacturer. It leaves the door wide open to an extremely large range of brands, types, applications, and qualities.\u00a0\nAftermarket parts, especially components related to safe driving like brake pads, are manufactured to extremely high standards, much like OEM brakes. They fit like the original parts and are intended to stop your car effectively. Where they vary significantly is in the pad material composition. Often, you\u2019ll find replacement aftermarket brake pads from the same brand in ceramic and semi-metallic materials, or even all three types.\u00a0\n\nPros and cons of OEM and aftermarket brakes\n\nWhen faced with different options to replace your current brake pads, which should you choose? Let\u2019s look at a brake pad comparison, OEM vs aftermarket, to see the pros and cons of each.\n\nOEM brake pads\n\nObviously, carmakers are confident that the brake pads they\u2019ve chosen for the vehicles they build will suit the purpose they intend. Even so, there are pros and cons for their choice.\u00a0\nFor the positive side, OEM brakes:\u00a0\n\nTend to be quiet on application\nProduce little dust that affects wheel appearance\nHave a smooth, soft pedal feel to stop the car\nDon\u2019t damage the rotor much during their lifecycle\n\nOEM brake pads aren\u2019t perfect, though. Things to consider include:\u00a0\n\nThey tend to wear out quicker than other choices due to their soft composition\nThey often cost more than comparable aftermarket parts\nStopping distances can be longer than you expect\nHeat dispersion can be an issue, causing warped rotors\nThey aren\u2019t designed for high-performance braking and can experience fade\n\nAftermarket brake pads\n\nFor ceramic brake pads, you\u2019ll notice they produce less dust than other options, there\u2019s very little noise on application, and they don\u2019t fade nearly as much as other types. They also don\u2019t create much wear on rotors. However, they can require more braking effort to stop the car, and they\u2019re the priciest option. They\u2019re often the best brake pads all around.\nFor semi-metallic brakes, you\u2019ll find they tend to wear out a little faster than ceramic but initially cost less. They disperse heat efficiently from the rotor, but their aggressive compound can create wear on the rotor during application. There\u2019s also more brake dust than some other options.\nFor organic brake pads, you won\u2019t hear much noise on application and the brake pedal feel is nice and soft. Brake dust is minimal, but they tend to wear out rather quickly. Organic brakes are inexpensive, typically.\n\nWhat should you choose?\n\nChoosing the right brake pads\nAs a driver, you\u2019ll need to decide which option is best the braking you want. OEM brake pads and rotors are made for your car by the same engineers who designed it, which can provide some peace of mind.\u00a0\nHowever, there are plenty of brake pad options from aftermarket brands like Duralast and Brembo that operate as good as the original equipment brakes, and often even better. Comparatively, they\u2019re often less expensive and last just as long or longer. Many products are backed by a Limited Lifetime warranty rather than a one-year warranty that most OEMs offer.\nBuy your next aftermarket brake pads at AutoZone. Explore parts from top brands that you know and trust with precise fitment and long-lasting quality. Find your parts online or ask an associate for assistance.\u00a0\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "5 Symptoms of a Bad Brake Master Cylinder",
        "content": "What is a Brake Master Cylinder?\u00a0\n\nA master cylinder is a hydraulic device that helps push fluid through the brake lines to the brakes themselves. The master cylinder contains two chambers, each with a piston. These pistons are connected to the brake pedal. When you press the brake pedal, the pistons push fluid from the chambers through the brake lines to the brake calipers or wheel cylinders, making them press the brake friction material against your rotors or drums.\u00a0\nSome parts are very closely related to the master cylinder too including:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fluid reservoir. There must always be brake fluid in the reservoir, otherwise air can enter the brake lines that needs to be bled out.\u00a0\nThe brake vacuum booster. This vacuum-assisted part helps minimize the brake force required to push the pistons in the master cylinder.\u00a0\nThe brake proportioning valve. This hydraulic valve helps direct the appropriate amount of pressure to the front and rear wheels respectively.\u00a0\n\nHow to Tell if Your Master Cylinder is Going Bad\u00a0\n\nAll of your braking operations hinge on the brake master cylinder working well. Your driving safety depends on it. If your car\u2019s master cylinder is going bad, there are several warning signs to watch out for.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBrake fluid is low: A car\u2019s master cylinder is responsible for supplying hydraulic pressure to the brakes. If it is leaking fluid, that pressure is reduced, and the brakes may not work as well as they should. You\u2019ll notice that the fluid level in the reservoir is low or empty, and that topping up the fluid isn\u2019t a long-term solution.\nBrake pedal sinks or feels spongy: A spongy or soft brake pedal can be caused by a leak in the system, and it can cause your brakes to fail. When the brake pedal sinks, that usually means that the fluid is being pushed out of the system with pressure, and when the pedal feels spongy, it indicates the presence of air in the lines. Either way, it can change how your car\u2019s brakes perform.\nContaminants in the brake fluid:\u00a0Another warning sign is if your brake fluid looks dirty or contaminated. It should look a light golden color or clear, but it does get darker when it has contaminants in it. These can be from the master cylinder allowing moisture into the system or, more likely, there are metal shavings from the master cylinder failing internally.\nGrinding noise when brakes are applied: If your car is making a grinding noise when you apply the brakes, it could also indicate that the master cylinder is going bad. The noise itself is from worn-out brake material, though, not the master cylinder itself. It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s more pressure to the front or rear brakes than normal, wearing them out prematurely and causing the grinding noise.\nCar pulls to one side when brakes are applied: When the car pulls to one side when brakes are applied, it could also be the master cylinder. In a situation like this, the car\u2019s brakes aren\u2019t getting pressure evenly on both sides, and the brakes grab and pull the car one way or the other.\n\nHow to Deal with a Bad Master Cylinder\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe best way to deal with a bad master cylinder is to replace it as soon as possible. A bad master cylinder can cause your brakes to fail, which can be extremely dangerous. If you\u2019re experiencing any brake problems, make sure to take your car to a mechanic right away to have it checked out or change the master cylinder yourself.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaster cylinder replacement will take a couple of hours if you prefer to do it yourself, but it\u2019s not exactly a difficult procedure. With the parking brake set and the transmission in park, suck any remaining fluid out of the reservoir and crack the brake lines loose with a wrench. Then, remove all the mounting bolts, the brake lines, any sensor connectors, and any other parts connected to the master cylinder. You\u2019ll need to unclip the piston rod from the brake booster next.\u00a0\u00a0\nInstall the new brake master cylinder, then fill it. Always use brake fluid matching the exact spec on the reservoir cap or your owner\u2019s manual, and only from a new container. Once it\u2019s installed, you\u2019ll need to bleed the air from the brakes at each wheel, making sure the reservoir never empties and allows more air in.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.",

        "title": "Causes for a Brake Caliper Sticking",
        "content": "What causes your brakes to be stuck?\n\nImmobility.\u00a0The most common cause of stuck brakes is immobility. If your car sits for long periods of time, you may notice slightly stuck brakes when you first get going, but this will typically work itself out in the first few moments of driving.\nDamp climate.\u00a0If you live in a damp climate, it\u2019s also possible that corrosion will creep into the system during an inactive period. Your brake rotors can rust and stick to the pads, your slider pins can become stuck, or your caliper pistons can seize. Again, in most situations, a little cautious driving with a few brake checks thrown in can clear less severe symptoms up.\nCorrosion.\u00a0Another common cause of sticky brakes is corrosion within the caliper pistons due to old brake fluid. Brake fluid is typically glycol-based and will protect all the metal parts in the brake system from corrosion, but if there is some moisture in the system, that water can lead to corrosion in the brakes, and especially in the caliper piston that activates the brake pads. It\u2019s a good idea to change your brake fluid every couple years to avoid the damage caused by the moisture that will inevitably enter brake fluid.\nHandbrake.\u00a0Your handbrake can also be a cause for sticking in the rear brakes. You can avoid this issue by lubricating your handbrake cable and mechanism occasionally.\n\nCommon symptoms of brake caliper sticking\n\nSome of the symptoms, like a burning smell or grinding noises, are very obvious but there are some that are less so. \n\nHere are a few symptoms of a sticky brake caliper\n\nYou can hear a grinding or squealing noise coming from only one of your wheels. This indicates that you may have a worn brake pad and if it\u2019s only coming from one wheel it may indicate a bad caliper. If all your calipers are good, your brakes should wear more evenly, requiring replacement at the same time.\n\nRemoving a Brake Caliper\n\nOn the same track, if you do a visual inspection of the brakes and notice that either the inside or outside pads on one caliper are wearing much faster, that is probably related to a sticky caliper piston or caliper slide pins.\nIf you notice that the car feels sluggish, or if it tends to pull to one side, you may have a seized caliper. If that happens, do a visual inspection to check for pad wear and obvious signs of a sticky caliper.\nA burning, acrid smell is a final warning, and one that you should take seriously because if your brakes are overheating enough to smell like they\u2019re burning you could start a fire at worst and damage the wheel hub and braking system at the very least. Pull over and conduct a visual inspection.\n\nSigns of a bad brake caliper\n\nDoing regular maintenance work on your own car is so important because it gives you an opportunity to visually check for wear items before they become an issue. Doing an oil change is a chance to check for new leaks or issues within the engine bay and under the vehicle. When you are switching winter tires over to summer tires you can do an inspection on your brakes, suspension, and drivetrain components.\nIf you notice that the brake pads at one wheel are wearing differently than the rest, especially if the inside or outside pad is heavily worn or worn at an angle, is a signal that something is wrong with your caliper. You will want to replace the pads and maybe even the brake rotor, but you should also address the underlying issue of the bad caliper.\n\nHow to fix it\n\nHow to replace a caliper\n\nIf you find that one of your calipers is sticking or completely seized, you can either replace the caliper or rebuild it yourself. Either way, you will need to flush and refill the brake fluid.\nThe easiest route is to purchase and install a new brake caliper. It\u2019s a good idea to install brake calipers in pairs, so do both rear calipers or both front calipers at the same time. The price of a new or rebuilt brake caliper will range from as low as $35 to several hundred dollars, depending on the make, model, and part grade. If your caliper piston is very corroded, you will definitely want to go with a new or rebuilt caliper.\nIf you aren\u2019t afraid to get your hands dirty and your caliper isn\u2019t too corroded, a caliper rebuild is well-within the abilities of most home mechanics and it\u2019s much less expensive, with most rebuild kits coming in at less than $10. You\u2019ll need to purchase the correct caliper rebuild kit for your vehicle, which will include some seals and gaskets, and you\u2019ll also want some brake cleaner.\nTake apart the caliper and clean off all the corrosion you can see or feel, replace all the rubber parts so that moisture can\u2019t infiltrate your braking system, and reassemble. Use a silicone-based brake lubricant for any of the moving parts that won\u2019t come into contact with brake fluid, like the caliper slider pins.\nOnce you\u2019ve reassembled the caliper and reinstalled it, flush all the old brake fluid and bleed the brake system.",

        "title": "Ceramic vs. Metallic Brake Pads: Which is Right for You",
        "content": "Metallic or Semi-Metallic Brake Pads\u00a0\n\nSemi-Metallic brake pads were introduced in the 1960s and use high levels of metals, including copper, iron, fine steel, or other alloys in the friction material. They have some distinct performance advantages over other types of brake pads, but there are also a few disadvantages:\u00a0\n\nDuralast-Semi-Metallic-Brake-Pads-MKD710\n\nSuitable for extreme driving styles, like racing or trucking applications. Metallic or semi-metallic brake pads are ideally suited for demanding performance applications because they have consistent pedal feel and dissipate heat well, which is essential on a racetrack or other demanding applications like trucking.\u00a0\u00a0\nStrong cold weather performance. Metallic pads operate well even under very cold conditions, so you don\u2019t need to heat them up before you use them to their maximum potential.\u00a0\nExcellent heat distribution properties. Your brake pads and rotors generate a lot of heat when they are in repeated use, and metallic pads conduct that heat through the entire system, lowering localized heat and resisting brake fade. This is important if you are travelling in mountainous areas, where you must use the brakes repeatedly.\u00a0\n\nHigh amounts of brake dust. Metallic brakes generate much more brake dust than ceramics, which will require you to wash your wheels more often.\u00a0\u00a0\nNoise. One of the more annoying characteristics of a metallic or semi-metallic brake pad is an increase in brake noise, but that\u2019s a price you pay for high performance.\u00a0\nIncreased brake rotor wear. Metallic brake pads have improved stopping capabilities, but that comes because of the increased friction created between the pads and the rotor. Increased friction means more wear, and you\u2019ll need to replace your rotors more often due to thinning of the rotor material.\u00a0\n\nCeramic Brake Pads\u00a0\n\nThe ceramic brake pad is the new kid on the block, having debuted in the 1980s. The friction material consists of ceramic, much like a denser version of the stuff found in pottery, infused with fine copper wires. The copper is added to enhance friction and to increase heat conductivity. Here are some of the positive and negative properties of ceramic brake pads:\u00a0\n\nDuralast-Ceramic-Brake-Pads-MKD747\n\nVery quiet. Ceramic brake pads are renowned for their quiet operation, which is a reason that they tend to be popular with luxury vehicles.\u00a0\nStrong wear characteristics. A set of ceramic pads will tend to last longer than metallic pads because they are harder and wear less.\u00a0\nVery low amounts of brake dust. Ceramic brake pads create much less brake dust than an organic or metallic pad.\u00a0\nReduced rotor wear. A ceramic brake pad will tend to \u201cgrab\u201d less than a semi-metallic pad, which lowers the friction and wear on the rotor.\u00a0\nPoor initial bite in cold conditions. Ceramic pads need to warm up before they are able to create their maximum braking performance. That can be a problem if you live in a cold climate, or for the first few laps if you take your car to the track.\u00a0\n\nLess heat conduction. Your ceramic pads won\u2019t transfer the friction heat through the pad, so it can build up and cause overheating issues with your brake system in extreme driving. Overheating can cause your brake fluid to lose its ability to pressurize and it can also warp your brake rotors.\u00a0\nHigher cost. Depending on the model of vehicle you\u2019re replacing the brake pads for, you may end up paying more for a set of ceramic brake pads.\u00a0\n\nWhich brake pad is right for your car?\u00a0\n\nBoth ceramic and the semi-metallic brake pads have their pros and cons, but what it really comes down to is your typical driving style and the types of conditions you will be driving in.\u00a0\n\nAverage driver in normal conditions\u00a0\n\nFor normal daily commuting needs in moderate climates, a ceramic brake pad can be a great solution, owing to its low noise and low dust operation. It will also tend to last longer than a metallic pad, so that means fewer trips to the shop over the life of the vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSpirited driver or extreme conditions\u00a0\n\nIf you want a brake pad that will give you excellent stopping power because you like to take your ride to the track, you\u2019ll want to use a semi-metallic brake pad. This may also apply if you have a lot of freeway driving in your commute and you want to have aggressive stopping power, just in case the guy in front of you does something unwise and you need to avoid it. Mountain driving, driving in cold climates, or trucking applications with heavy loads are also strong candidates for a semi-metallic brake pad.\u00a0\n\nWhen should I replace my brake pads?\u00a0\n\nHow long do brake pads last? You should replace your brake pads when they have less than a quarter inch of friction material left, or if you notice any of the following symptoms:\u00a0\n\nNew squealing sounds (not regular squeaks from semi-metallic pads)\u00a0\nGrind sounds when braking\u00a0\nVibration in the steering wheel\u00a0\nPulsation in the brake pedal\u00a0\nBrake pad indicator light on your dash\u00a0\n\nReplacing brake pads",

        "content": "How Brake Fluid Works\u00a0\nWhen you put your foot onto the brake, a vacuum booster amplifies the force of your foot, activates the master cylinder, and releases pressurized brake fluid into the brake lines transporting it to brake pads. This helps create friction with the rotors to stop your car\u2019s wheels.\u202f\u00a0Check out this resource to learn more on how brake fluid works.\n\nWhen You Should Replace Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nOver time, brake fluid can lose its effectiveness due to water contamination and brake line corrosion. Learning how to check your brake fluid is important. Signs like soft brake pedals, oil puddles under the car, aging brake pads, and ABS warnings signify that it\u2019s time to change your brake fluid. Timelines of when you should switch out your brake fluid vary between two and five years, but your manufacturer will have guidelines of when you should do this.\u202f\u00a0\n\nHow to check and top off your brake fluid\n\nDOT 3 vs. DOT 4 Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nFor your brake fluid to be the most effective, it needs to have the right thickness and flow, also known as viscosity and high boiling point. Two primary types of brake fluid differ on these elements \u2014 Department of Transportation (DOT) 3 and 4.

        "content": "How Many Parts Do Brake Pads Have?\n\nBrake pads are a simple mechanical part, but they do have a few different components that can differentiate the quality of the part.\n\nBacking Plate \u2013 he backing plate is constructed with steel and provides the backbone for the entire brake pad. All the other parts are fastened to the backing plate.\nShims \u2013 The backing plate is constructed with steel and provides the backbone for the entire brake pad. All the other parts are fastened to the backing plate.\nFriction Material \u2013 The friction material is the part of the pad that contacts the brake rotor and wears down over time. There are often specially designed slots, or cuts, through the friction material to aid in braking power and reduce noise. A good quality friction material will also be chamfered, which means that each end has an angle cut which reduces brake noise and improves progressive braking.\nClips or Springs \u2013 Some brakes require clips or springs to situate the brake pad properly on the mounting bracket. New clips will often be included in higher part grades, but it is possible to reuse clips as long as they haven\u2019t been bent or damaged.\n\nWhich Brands are Best for My Car?\n\nWhen it comes time to replace your pads, use this handy guide to determine the best brands of brake pad to purchase for your repair. There are three broad categories of brake pad available to consumers: standard, upgraded, and premium. We\u2019ll take a look at a few options in each of those categories here.\n\nStandard Brake Pads\n\nStandard brake pads will be made to fit your vehicle like the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts, with materials and components that match or exceed specifications from the manufacturer. They\u2019re usually less expensive than the upgraded or premium trim levels but are suitable for normal diving.\n\nDuralast\n\nDuralast brake pads boast better than average noise and brake dust ratings and match the standards for friction properties laid out by the original equipment manufacturer. They have two or more layers of shim material included. If you are an average driver, this range of brake pads will serve your needs quite well.\u00a0\n\nUpgraded Brake Pads\n\nUpgraded brake pads will also fit your vehicle like the OEM parts, but their materials and construction will exceed the specifications from the OEM. They are still very affordable, but provide enhanced stopping power and durability, which can come in handy if you drive on a freeway regularly.\n\nDuralast Gold Brake Pads\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to upgrade from the standard brake pads that came with your vehicle, Duralast Gold Brake Pads are a great choice. They have enhanced noise resistance and reduced brake dust emissions, plus their slots and chamfered edges are engineered to provide heightened safety and heat reduction. The friction material can be either semi-metallic or ceramic, depending on the OE material, so they are effective in a wide range of conditions. The shims on Duralast Gold pads are 3+ layers of vulcanized rubber to minimize brake rattle, so you won\u2019t hear annoying sounds coming from the wheels. If your car requires clips as part of the brake pad installation, Duralast Gold brake pads include stainless steel clips, for long-lasting, rust-free performance.\u00a0\n\nPremium Brake Pads\n\nA set of premium brake pads will have superior stopping power and will be designed to undergo repeated stops from high speeds. The friction material will sometimes be made out of a ceramic compound to reduce noise and dust, but there are some performance advantages to semi-metallic friction materials, so you\u2019ll see those compounds in this category as well. This group of pads will typically have the highest price point.\n\nDuralast Elite Brake Pads\n\nThe lowest noise ratings and the smallest amount of brake dust emissions make Duralast Elite brake pads a great premium choice. If you\u2019re wondering how these pads meet those standards, it\u2019s because of the composition of the Next Generation Ceramic Technology friction material in the brake pad. All Duralast Elite pads use 3+ layers of vulcanized rubber shims and include any required clips in stainless steel. You may expect these brake pads to have a premium price, but the increase in price from Duralast Gold brake pads is not that noticeable.\u00a0 If You\u2019re driving a luxury car and you want a quiet ride with clean rims, Duralast Elite ceramic brake pads would be an excellent choice for you.\n\nBrembo Premium Ceramic Brake Pads\n\nBrembo has been a worldwide name in brakes since the 1970s when it burst onto the Formula 1 scene, supplying brakes for Ferrari. Brembo is known for supplying brake components to high-end sports car and luxury manufacturers but has also developed a presence in other market segments with brake pads and rotors. Brembo premium ceramic brake pads will provide premium braking power at a premium price.\n\nDuralast Severe Duty Brake Pads\n\nIf you\u2019re daily commute includes a trailer on the hitch, you may want to invest in a set of Duralast Severe Duty brake pads. They have a specially formulated friction material that is suited for towing heavy vehicles or loads, with frequent stops. They are engineered for thermal stability to resist brake fade, which is essential when you are towing a load in traffic.\n\nDuralast Max Brake Pads\n\nDuralast Max brake pads have superior stopping power with an advanced semi-metallic friction material that resists fade and dissipates heat. They\u2019re designed to provide repeatable, consistent stopping distances and they are a great choice for extreme applications like fleet, towing, or pursuit vehicles. If your vehicle sees a lot of aggressive or repeated stopping, these are the pads for you.\n\nStart Your Project Today",

Nitrile gloves not only protect your hands from chemicals, but they also keep them from getting filthy, and most professional and amateur mechanics who try them never go back to bare skin.\n\nNitrile Gloves\n\nHow Can I Tell if I Need to Change My Brake Pads?\nMany modern cars have advanced sensing systems that warn the driver when brake pad thickness is too low, but your most effective tools for diagnosing worn out brakes are your ears and eyes.\nBrake pads have a small metal warning tab that begins to contact the brake rotor when the pad is almost worn out. This is what usually causes that annoying brake squealing sound when braking at low speed. If your brakes start to squeal, take off the tire and look at the pads. If they have less than 4/32\u201d of material, not including the metal bracket, you should plan to replace them soon.\nWorking on your own car is great because it saves you money, gives you a sense of accomplishment, and keeps you in touch with the mechanics of the vehicle so that you can diagnose small problems before they become big problems.",

        "title": "Worn Out Brake Pads: Signs of Bad Brake Pads & What to do Next",
        "content": "How Do I Know if My Brake Pads are Worn Out?\n\nBrake pads all have a solid steel backing plate to which the friction material is bonded. There are three different types of pad material you\u2019ll find for most passenger vehicles:\n\nNon-metallic or organic brake pads have a blend of synthetic materials like cellulose, sintered glass, aramid, and other compounds in various quantities depending on the manufacturer. They\u2019re quiet and a relatively soft material so they aren\u2019t hard on rotors but have a shorter lifespan than other options.\nSemi-metallic brake pads are a combination of metals like copper, steel, and iron mixed with non-metallic compounds like graphite and fillers. They\u2019re longer lasting but can be noisy at times and generate more wear on the rotors.\nCeramic brake pads combine elements like clay and porcelain with copper fibers for quieter stopping, long wear life, and resistance to rotor wear.\n\nRegardless of what material your brake pads are made of, they\u2019re eventually going to wear out. The best way to determine if your brakes are worn out and need to be replaced is with a visual inspection. When the wheel has been removed, both the inner and outer brake pad thicknesses should be measured at each end to see who much material is remaining.\nMost brake pads are manufactured with between 8/32\u201d and 12/32\u201d of wear material, not including the backing plate. When the remaining material is down to 3/32\u201d, it\u2019s time to replace your brake pads. If you continue to drive, you could notice symptoms of worn brake pads worsen when the material is at or below 2/32\u201d.\n\nSigns Your Brake Pads are Worn\n\nSquealing when you stop. Many brake pads have squealer tabs that touch the rotor to make noise as a warning sign your pads are low.\u00a0\nGrinding when you drive and brake. If the brake pads are worn out, the backing plate can contact the rotor and exhibit metal-on-metal grinding noises as well as a rough feeling in the brake pedal.\nExtended stopping distances. The friction material helps you slow down sooner, and worn-out brakes often aren\u2019t as effective.\nGrooves in the rotor surface. You can often visualize the rotor between the wheel spokes, and deep grooves indicate your brakes are worn out.\nPulsation in the pedal. You might feel the brake pedal kicking back at you rapidly as you try to brake from high speed.\nPulling to one side. If brakes are worn out on one side only, braking is uneven and can pull you to one side or the other.\n\nHow Long Can You Drive with Worn Out Brakes?\n\nIt\u2019s technically possible to drive with worn-out brake pads with increasingly poor application as the material grinds away. If you have 4/32\u201d friction material left, it could be thousands of miles or months before any safety-related concerns show up. Once they do, however, you could be in a situation where your brakes no longer perform as designed.\u00a0\nWhen 2/32\u201d material remains on your brake pads, any mechanic will strongly encourage you to replace them immediately. In some states like Virginia, worn brakes won\u2019t pass a safety inspection at this level. Not only could you be sidelined from brake failure, but ignoring the repair could take your car off the road until they\u2019re replaced.\nLeft unfixed long-term, brake pads will eventually wear into the rotors, forcing you to replace them as well. The caliper piston could over-extend or contact the rotor surface in extreme situations, requiring new calipers too. Altogether, it\u2019s simply unsafe to drive for long without changing worn brake pads.\n\nReplacing Worn Brake Pads\n\nMost DIYers will give a brake job a shot at home. It requires some common tools that you\u2019ll find around a well-equipped garage including:\n\nA floor jack and wheel chocks\nA lug nut wrench\nA socket and ratchet set\nA large C-clamp or caliper compression tool\nFlat screwdriver\nSilicone-based brake lubricant\nBrake cleaner spray\nEye protection and gloves\n\nChanging your own brake pads is a pretty straightforward job and also a great way to save on cost. Now that you have identified that your brake pads are worn out, you can learn how to change your brake pads in our step by step guide.",

        "title": "Why Are My Brake Lights Not Working?",
        "content": "Why are My Brake Lights Staying On or Off?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why your brakes lights won\u2019t turn off or on. Some of the most common reasons that your brake lights are out or malfunctioning include:\nProblems with the brake light switchIssues with the brake light switch circuit\u00a0\u2013 usually a groundBrake light bulbs that have\u00a0burned outBrake light socket has gone bad\u00a0or are corrodedTurn signal switch defective\nThe brake light bulb is the first thing you should check since it is the easiest and cheapest repair. If that is not the issue, you are going to need to know how to troubleshoot problems with either the brake light switch itself or its circuit \u2013 something that is much easier said than done.\u00a0At this point, if you feel you need a mechanic to troubleshoot the circuit, feel free to check out our list of\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0in your area that can help fix your issue.\n\nHow to Troubleshoot Brake Lights That Aren\u2019t Working\n\nIn order to properly troubleshoot brake lights, the first and most important piece of equipment you\u2019ll need is a Multimeter\u00a0(Volt Meter)\u00a0and/or a Voltage Light (probe). Either will do the trick, but the Multimeter will usually prove to be better for testing grounds and continuity. If you\u2019re uncertain how to properly use a Multimeter, you\u2019ll want to tackle that first, as the rest of the article assumes proper use of\u00a0the equipment.\nAs mentioned before, start by checking the bulb\u00a0and any fuses marked brake lights / turn signal / tail lights. In many vehicles, your turn signal bulb\u2019s\u00a0filament\u00a0is shared by the brake light\u00a0as well. This means that when your brake pedal is depressed, this\u00a0filament\u00a0lights up. If the brake pedal is pressed when the turn signal is engaged, the turn signal still\u00a0has to\u00a0turn this already illuminated bulb on and off, no different than if the brake pedal\u00a0wasn\u2019t\u00a0pressed. In most vehicles, the brake light circuit has a relationship with the turn signal circuit.\nOnce the bulb has been ruled out, your next step\u00a0is to check the\u00a0socket. Depending on the style of\u00a0socket, look for corrosion, melted plastic, and make sure that the\u00a0socket\u00a0is completely clean. Many sockets will have dielectric grease (commonly called bulb grease) in them \u2013 this is a good thing\u00a0for keeping\u00a0pesky\u00a0corrosion at bay. For the sake of diagnosis though,\u00a0you will\u00a0need to take a Q-tip and clean out as much of the grease as possible. Many\u00a0brake\u00a0light issues can be traced to a bad\u00a0socket, and\u00a0visual inspection is usually the first step to diagnosing this kind of issue. Clean the\u00a0socket\u00a0if\u00a0it is\u00a0dirty\u00a0with a micro file, sand paper, wire brush, or electrical solvent,\u00a0and test the bulb again. \nIf\u00a0there\u2019s\u00a0still an issue, the next step is to test voltage\u00a0and ground.\u00a0At this point,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a good idea\u00a0to source a wiring diagram that will show you which wires at the taillights\u00a0are responsible for\u00a0your 12V power to the brake lights, and where the ground points are\u00a0located. Some grounds are right at the\u00a0taillight assembly, while others share a common ground in a location, like in the trunk or underbody of the vehicle.\nTesting voltage\u00a0and ground\u00a0involves using the Multimeter to probe the socket and wires, starting at the rear of the car where most problems occur. The lights at the rear of the car usually share a common ground, or series of grounds, and often times these can be the culprit due to corrosion or being dirty.\nStart by\u00a0finding a reliable ground on the body or in the trunk of the vehicle. This could be a clean, exposed bolt, or clean area of the body behind one of the taillights.\u00a0For reference, the entire body of the vehicle acts as a ground, so once you find a good piece of exposed body metal, you should have a good ground source.\u00a0Put\u00a0your multimeter into\u00a0DC\u00a0volts, and have a partner press the brake pedal on command.\u00a0\nBegin by testing the\u00a0socket\u00a0pins that engage the brake light\u00a0filament. If this\u00a0socket\u00a0is a dual-pin, the other\u00a0filament\u00a0is your driving lights, and these can be easily found by simply\u00a0turning on the lights of the\u00a0vehicle\u00a0to\u00a0identify. If no voltage is found at the\u00a0socket, trace the 12V\u00a0wire\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0socket\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0been identified as the brake light wire\u00a0back and test an area of the wire. This can be done with a probing pin\u00a0on your multimeter to essentially \u201cstab\u201d the wire. You are doing this to rule out that something in the\u00a0socket\u00a0connection is bad. If you suddenly have 12V when you stab the wire, you know your problem is either in the\u00a0socket\u00a0or ground.\u00a0Next,\u00a0let\u2019s\u00a0test the ground.\n\nHow to Test Bad Ground Connections\n\nGrounds are a constant nemesis on anything with 12V DC power. Just a slight amount of corrosion over time, and suddenly a ground\u00a0will not\u00a0function properly, leaving an open circuit. To test grounds, the easiest solution\u00a0is to put your voltmeter\u00a0into\u00a0Continuity (Ohms) setting. Most meters will have an audible diode test setting, which means when the two probes are touched together, you get an audible beep out of the meter, which is far easier than staring at the screen. This setting is ideal for testing\u00a0that\u00a0these\u00a0grounds\u00a0are working properly\u00a0with good connection.\nTouch one of the probes to your\u00a0ground bolt you\u00a0identified\u00a0in the earlier\u00a0test. Now, test all the ground connections\u00a0by touching the probe to the metal connecting\u00a0lug\u00a0or terminals as close to the grounding bolt or area as possible. If you hear a beep, you know the ground is good. Even with this,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0a good idea\u00a0to loosen the ground bolt, clean the terminal, and re-install.\u00a0When testing grounds, if you\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0hear the beep, you know that you are not getting continuity from your good, known ground point to the ground being tested, making this testing ground spot suspect.\u00a0Test grounding locations or wires all the way up to the\u00a0socket\u00a0to\u00a0ensure\u00a0your ground is still solid.\n\nTroubleshoot the Circuit Further\n\nIf all the grounds at the rear of the vehicle check out ok, and\u00a0you\u00a0still have no voltage at any of the 12V sources here, your problem is further upstream. Wiring issues\u00a0further up can also lead to this type of problem.\u00a0If a wire has shorted\u00a0or broken,\u00a0you\u2019ll\u00a0need to trace that wire all the way back to the dash\u00a0and brake light switch.\nBCM problems can lead to brake lights failing as well\u00a0in cars that use the BCM as a trigger. A mechanic should check to make sure the circuit is not broken. If it is intact, then the mechanic will need to either look at an available technical service manual or replace the BCM itself.\n\nBrake Light Switch or Turn Signal Problems\n\nOn older vehicles, like classic cars, the brake light switch is often a hydraulic switch, mounted right in the brake fluid circuit\u00a0\u2013 usually connecting to the brake line or into the\u00a0master\u00a0cylinder. When brake fluid pressure increases (because the brakes are engaged) this triggers the switch.\u00a0This switch will have 2 bullet-style connectors on it that are prone to corrosion. Clean these accordingly first, then look into replacing the switch.\nAs mentioned before, the brake circuit usually travels a path through the turn signal switch. Although uncommon, some vehicles can have a failed turn signal switch that will still give you turn signals, but cause your brake lights not to properly function.\u00a0When troubleshooting is leading you to dead ends,\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0overlook this switch as a possibility.\nTroubleshoot anything electrical can be challenging, but checking off each box in diagnosis will help you narrow down\u00a0all the potential causes.

        "title": "How Much a Brake Pad and Rotor Replacement Costs",
        "content": "Frequency of Brake Jobs\n\nHow often you need to schedule a brake job depends on a number of factors, including how often you drive your vehicle, in what conditions you drive your vehicle, the quality of the parts with which you equip your vehicle and how often you have your brake system maintained. That said, there are certain standards to which you can refer.\nMost brake pad companies and mechanics can agree that quality\u202fbrake pads should last anywhere between 30,000 and 70,000 miles. However, some may need replacement every 25,000 miles, while others can last far longer than 70,000 miles.\nOutside of brake pads, brake rotors and calipers, which are more expensive and often more complicated to replace than pads, have varying life cycles. Simply servicing your brake fluid by regularly flushing can extend the life of calipers by preventing corrosion from within the system. Brake rotors should either be \u201cturned\u201d or machined flat on a brake lathe, or replaced with a new rotor. In today\u2019s environment, the cost of brake rotors is often comparable to the cost of machining those rotors, so often a replacement is a better option to go with. Most shops in most cases will recommend either/or with every brake job. It\u2019s not advised to simply replace pads on an old rotor surface, so always expect that the shop will address the rotors at the same time.\nHow often your brake pads need to be changed or brakes serviced really boils down to these factors:\n\nEnvironment: Stop-and-go driving, such as the type of driving people experience in cities, can drastically shorten the lifespan of a vehicle\u2019s braking system. So too can mountainous environments where drivers have to ride the brakes to control downhill speeds.\nDriving Habits: Drivers who ride the brakes or routinely stop abruptly risk wearing out their brakes prematurely. Those who are in the habit of stopping gradually may enjoy a longer brake lifespan.\nMaterials: Brake pads, rotors, and calipers are all made of different materials, each of which affects durability. For instance, high-carbon based \u201csevere duty\u201d pads can last longer than standard semi-metallic material. However, because they\u2019re more durable, they often cost much more than their counterparts. Ceramic brake pads generally provide quieter braking and less dusting, but often their braking performance isn\u2019t as great as a semi-metallic pad. Often times, there\u2019s some give-and-take between materials.\n\nNow that you understand how often you\u2019ll need to get your brakes replaced, you may wonder what the actual price for new brakes and rotors actually is. How much will this particular aspect of vehicle maintenance eat into your monthly or annual budget?\n\nThe Actual Cost of Brakes\n\nIf you know how to do it, you can save a good deal of money by replacing brake pads and rotors yourself. However, not everyone is mechanically inclined and not everyone has the time to do their own brake maintenance. To ensure you get the best possible deal, call around for quotes from a few different mechanics. Some questions each mechanic should ask you to give you an accurate brake job quote are as follows:\n\nWhat Brand of Vehicle Do You Drive? Typically, parts for European-made vehicles such as BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Jaguars will cost you more than parts for domestic or Japanese-made vehicles. Also, because European vehicle systems differ from American-systems, the mechanic may require more time to make the switch, which means higher labor costs.\nWhat Kind of Vehicle Do You Drive? In addition to asking about the brand of vehicle you drive, the mechanic should ask about the make and model. The driver of a Chevy 3500 Diesel truck will pay exponentially more for new brakes than the driver of, say, a Ford Fiesta. Likewise, many 4WD and AWD cars have brake rotors that require more steps and time to remove, and ultimately cost more money in labor in doing so. Size and weight, plus the type of drive on a vehicle (2WD vs 4WD) plays a role in the type of materials the brake system needs as well as how long the brake repair job will take.\nWhat Kind of Driving Do You Do? If you use your vehicle for standard city or highway driving, your answer to this question shouldn\u2019t affect the overall cost of the repair job. However, you are operating a vehicle that does a lot of towing, or severe duty work, you\u2019re going to want a brake pad suited for such use.\nWhat Kind of Materials Do You Want To Use? The friction of brake pads comes in a variety of materials, including ceramic, semi-metallic and organic, all of which perform differently and come with varying price tags. If you purchase aftermarket brake pads from a premium brand, expect to pay premium prices. Likewise, if you go with an off-brand, you can save a bit. If you want OEM brake parts, expect to pay a pretty-penny, as original parts are often the most expensive.\n\nBrake Pad Replacement Cost\n\nUnfortunately, there is no hard and fast answer to the question of how much new brakes should cost. Every mechanic charges a different hourly rate and every manufacturer prices its parts singularly. That said, for brake pad replacement only, you can expect to pay between $35 and $150 for parts for all four wheels. Labor typically runs between $80 and $120 per axle, making for a grand total of between $115 and $270 per axle.\nAs stated before, replacing rotors with your brake pads is critical for best braking and maximum safety. New pads on worn rotors can create issues with the new pads, cause vibration, or make braking less safe than with new pads and new rotors together. Rotors cost between $30 and $75 each. Higher-quality rotors like\u00a0Duralast Gold, which feature a coated hat and edge and are designed to outperform your vehicle\u2019s original equipment, usually cost a little more. Labor at a shop to replace rotors and pads is approximately $150 to $200 per axle. Brake rotor and pad repair generally comes out to around $250 to $500 per axle when visiting a professional shop.\nCalipers are the most difficult and expensive aspect of the braking system to replace. A single caliper can cost up to $130 and several will reach prices even higher. A complete brake repair \u2014 one that includes pads, rotor and caliper replacement \u2014 typically averages between $300 and $800. However, depending on the make and model of your vehicle, you can easily spend more than $1,000 on a complete brake job.\nOf course, you can save a significant amount of money if you learn to replace the pads, rotors and calipers yourself. Before you go the\u00a0DIY maintenance\u00a0route, though, bear in mind that your safety should come before cost. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable making the repair yourself, you can chose from one of our preferred installers in your area.\n\nFind a Repair Shop Near You",

        "title": "How to Change Brake Pads and Rotors",
        "content": "How to Replace Brake Pads and Rotors \n\n1. Safety first\n\nPark the vehicle on a dry, flat surface and install wheel chocks. Be sure to wear safety goggles and protective gloves. Be careful when lifting the car. Use secure jack points for the jack and jack stands.\n\n2. Check the brake fluid level\n\nOpen the hood and check the brake fluid reservoir. If it\u2019s full, some fluid needs to be removed. This will help avoid spillage due to overflow when compressing the brake caliper piston.\n\n3. Raise the vehicle and remove the wheel\n\nLoosen the lug nuts with a breaker bar and socket while the wheel is on the ground and stationary. Raise the vehicle with a hydraulic jack from a secure point. Place a jack stand or stands under the appropriate points and safely lower the vehicle onto the jack stands. Remove the lug nuts and the wheel.\n\n4. Remove the bolts and the caliper\n\nYou should be able to reach the caliper bolts pretty easily. Turning the wheel left or right will provide easier access.  Once the caliper is removed, suspend it with a bungee cord.  Note: Removing the caliper may require different steps on your vehicle. \n\n5. Remove the old pads and rotor\n\nInspect the old pads for uneven wear patterns. Uneven wear is an indicator of the pad or pads \u2018sticking\u2019 due to lack of lubricant, worn pad or caliper hardware, or a sticking caliper piston. The brake pad box will have a guide to reference when inspecting for uneven wear. \nOnce the pads are off, remove the rotor. On many vehicles, you\u2019ll need to remove the caliper mounting bracket in order to remove the rotor. The brake caliper bolts to the brake caliper mounting bracket which bolts to the spindle assembly. To remove the brake rotor, first remove the brake caliper and then remove the brake caliper bracket. This will allow access to the rotor. \nWhen removing the rotor, watch out for rust or uneven wear. You may need help from a rust penetrant like PB B\u2019laster or a mallet to finish removing it from the hub assembly.\n\n6. Clean the rotor mounting surface\n\nThe hub surface needs to be cleaned with a wire brush to remove rust and debris. This will ensure the new rotor sits flush on the hub and eliminates the possibility of pedal pulsation. Rust as thin as a sheet of paper can translate to pedal pulsation.\n\n7. Clean the new rotor\n\n8. Install the new rotor\n\nLook at you. You\u2019re doing great.\n\n9. Install brake hardware\n\nReplace the brake hardware with  new hardware. When worn, old brake hardware creates vibrations that is heard in the form of brake noise at low stopping speeds. These clips should be replaced with each brake job. Make sure to apply  brake lubricant at the slider contact points before installing the hardware.\n\n10. Get brake pads ready to install\n\nNote the wear-sensor position orientation to install the pads correctly. Different pads have varying wear-sensor placement. Some pad sets have wear sensors on just the inner pads, some on all four pads, and some do not have wear sensors.\n\n11. Install new brake pads\n\nLooking good over here!\n\n12. Inspect brake caliper and piston, then compress\n\nLook at the brake caliper and piston and inspect it for any brake fluid seepage. If the caliper and piston are clean, use the  front/rear disc brake pad spreader set to safely seat the caliper piston. You can borrow the spreader set for free from any AutoZone through Loan-A-Tool.* On some rear disc brakes, the caliper pistons screw in, and require the disc brake pad spreader set to be seated properly. \n\n13. Install the caliper\n\nTake the caliper off the bungee cord and put it back on. VERY IMPORTANT \u2013 DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN the caliper bolts. This can lead to much bigger problems. Start tightening the bolts with a socket, then use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts correctly. You can borrow a torque wrench for free at any AutoZone through Loan-A-Tool. Consult a service manual for proper torque specs.\n\n14. Check brake fluid reservoir\n\nTop-off to the max fill line if needed. Be sure the brake fluid reservoir cap is installed before going to the next step. This will avoid spillage.\n\n15. Pump the brakes\n\nThis will make sure brake fluid is flowing properly and the system is working. Sit in the vehicle and slowly pump the brake pedal until it feels firm. CAUTION Do NOT press the brake pedal all the way to the floor. This may cause internal damage to the brake master cylinder assembly.\n\n16. Check the brake fluid reservoir again\n\nTop-off again if necessary. Always re-install the cap after topping off to avoid spillage.\n\n17. Install the wheel and lower the vehicle\n\nInstall the wheel and tighten the lug nuts while the vehicle is raised. Raise the vehicle with a jack, remove the jack stands, lower the vehicle until the wheel is just touching, and tighten the lug nuts with a torque wrench. Consult your owner\u2019s manual for the proper torque for your vehicle.\n\n18. Repeat on the remaining wheels\n\nMake sure the brake pedal is firm before driving.\n\n19. Go for an easy drive\n\nGo for a safe, easy drive to break in the new brakes. On a safe road, accelerate to around 50mph. Apply the brakes, not too hard, and slowly bring the vehicle\u2019s speed down to 30mph. Continue to drive at this speed for 2 to 3 minutes to allow the brakes to cool. Repeat this process four to five times until the new brakes are ready for daily use. This process is known as bedding brakes.\n\nNote: These steps provide a general outline for replacing brake pads and rotors on the front disc brakes of most vehicles. Some steps may vary by year, make and model. Reference a repair guide\u00a0or one of our\u00a0vehicle specific videos for more specific information.

        "title": "Bedding Brakes: How It's Done and Why It Matters",
        "content": "Is Bedding Brake Pads Necessary?\nFor most folks, the gradual wearing-in of your brake pads and rotors will be performed through natural driving, but if you want your pads to perform great right out of the gate, and minimize potential issues, doing a procedure known as \u201cbedding in\u201d is extremely helpful. It\u2019s also a good way to safely stress-test your braking system to be sure everything is working properly, and even more important, it helps you understand exactly how your brakes do their job.\nThe first thing to understand is what actually is happening with a fresh set of pads and rotors. If you look at the friction surface on a used rotor, you\u2019ll notice a shiny, smooth grey-blue \u201cglaze\u201d that is on the surface. This material is actually known as \u201cpad transfer\u201d. It\u2019s actually brake pad material that through the high temperature, high friction process has been deposited on the rotor. A brake pad pressing against bare metal actually doesn\u2019t stop well. But, a brake pad pressing up against brake pad material, with steel underneath stops! But, when you first change your pads and rotors, you have none of this pad transfer material on your rotors, and laying down a good foundation for future material is what the bedding-in procedure does.\nWhy Should You Bed Brake Pads?\nMany times, if pads are run too hard, too fast, the pad surface can heavily transfer (think literally melt) onto the rotor when the car is parked, which causes an uneven area of pad material deposited on the brake rotor. Once you drive again, new pad material is then deposited on top of and around this extra deposit, creating an un-even surface on the rotor. In a majority of cases, this very phenomenon is what is actually diagnosed as a \u201cwarped rotor\u201d when newly installed pads and rotors quickly develop a pulsation. There\u2019s a good chance this problem could have been avoided with the proper bedding-in procedure wasn\u2019t done properly!\nBrake Bedding Procedure\n\nHow to bed your brakes\nIt\u2019s important to understand that this procedure should be performed on a safe road, away from traffic \u2013 as it\u2019s a good way to test the system of new brake components for any other faults: You will be stopping frequently, so pick a good, flat road where you are able to achieve speed of 45-50 MPH, and be able to stop quickly, away from cars. The break bedding in procedure is a process of quickly heating and cooling the brakes in a repeated fashion, and while doing so it deposits a layer of pad material on the rotor surface. Temperature needs to be slowly heated to max use, which will create a smooth, even pad transfer. To do this, follow the following steps.\n\nHow to Bed Brakes\n\n1. Pick Your Spot\n\nFind an open stretch of road that will allow you to safely stop your vehicle multiple times.\n\n2. Speed Up, Then Slow Down\n\nAccelerate to 35 MPH and apply moderate brake pressure to reduce your speed to under 5 MPH.\n\n3. Repeat as Necessary\n\nRepeat this process 2-3 times, accelerating back to 35 MPH and moderately braking.\n\n4. Test Again at 55 MPH\n\nNext, increase speed to 50 MPH and strongly brake down to 5 MPH. You don\u2019t want to brake strong enough to activate your ABS or lock up the tires. You should be able to come down to 5 MPH within a few seconds.\n\n5. Repeat as Necessary\n\nRepeat this process 4-5 times, then drive an additional 1-2 miles while very lightly braking to cool down the brakes.\n\n6. Pro Tip:\n\nIt\u2019s important to avoid coming to a complete stop during the hard-braking stage as it\u2019s possible to melt brake pads against hot rotors. Of course, should a deer, pedestrian, or Sasquatch run onto the road, feel free to mash the brake pedal. Safety first!\n\nYour stop-and-go session is now complete. Park the car and allow the brakes to fully cool for an hour. For best results, avoid pressing down on the brake pedal when parked and take a route home with minimal stop lights while the brakes are cooling.\nWhile bedding in your brakes can sound like a sensitive procedure, one funky stop isn\u2019t going to ruin your efforts. There\u2019s no need to stress out, just drive safely and avoid emergency stops when possible.\nThe important thing here is once you\u2019ve completed the procedure, be sure to go easy on the brake as you return the car back home for cooling. The idea is to heat the brakes up through the cycles listed above, and then let them cool easily on the ride home, and while the car is parked. Once done, your brakes have been bedded in, and a good foundation has been put down!",

        "title": "How to Flush Brake Fluid",
        "content": "Why Does Brake Fluid Wear Out?\nBrake fluid, a hydraulic fluid, by its chemical design is hygroscopic, which means it absorbs water at a rapid rate. This presents problems in any brake system as the master cylinder, lines, proportioning valves,\u00a0ABS system, and calipers are all composed of parts made from aluminum or steel, metals that corrode in water! Brake fluid is arguably the most ignored fluid change on your car, with some cars going all the way to brake component failure until the component is changed and fluid is flushed. Don\u2019t let it get that far!\nAny time the brake system is exposed to any air (usually from the master cylinder reservoir), the fluid absorbs moisture, and as it does so, it\u2019s color turns from clear to a rusty brown over the course of thousands of miles, as corrosion begins inside the brake system. The more water in the fluid, the lower the brake fluid boiling point becomes (think of how hot brakes operate) and the more corrosive the fluid gets. Corrosive brake fluid is the #1 reason why calipers and wheel cylinders begin to seize, as corrosion inside the bores of the cylinder occurs from the contaminated fluid.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Brake Fluid Flush?\nHere enters the brake fluid flush. A car owner who can proactively flush their brake fluid every time a set of pads or shoes is/are installed on their car (usually every 35-60K miles) reduces the risk of brake fade and future caliper or wheel cylinder failure, and they will get overall better brake performance.\nPerforming a brake fluid flush is an easy task, like changing oil. Before anything, be sure to always make sure to read who to properly bleed the brake system by doing a 2-person brake bleed. If you are unsure, you can always take your car to your preferred mechanic and ask for the fluid to be flushed.\nIf you are familiar with how to bleed brakes, you will be performing this process the same way as when you change a caliper, brake line, or wheel cylinder. This process is best done by a simple 2-person brake bleed \u2013 one person operating the pedal and holding, while the other opens the bleeder screw for less than 2 seconds. You will also need a quart of your favorite brand, and type of brake fluid (remember to check whether the car takes DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid).\n\nHow to Bleed Brake Fluid by Yourself\nBrake fluid should be replaced every 2-4 years, or if your brake pedal feels spongy. With a brake bleeder tool, you bleed your brakes in about an hour without any additional help.\nRead More \n\nHow to Bleed Brake Fluid the Lazy Way (Gravity Bleed)\nBleeding your brake system can be done a few ways. This option only requires one person, and is less labor intensive.\nRead More \n\nHow to Bleed Brake Fluid with a Friend\nBleeding your brake system can be done a few ways. This method requires two people. \nRead More \n\nHow to Flush and Change Brake Fluid\n\n1. Empty the Master Cylinder Reservoir\n\nThe first step is to completely remove all the fluid that\u2019s currently sitting inside the master cylinder reservoir. This can be done a number of ways, but a large syringe, turkey baster, small siphon pump, or transfer pump and tube can easy remove all the fluid from the reservoir while the car is off and in park, with no pressure on the brakes.\n\n2. Fill and Bleed\n\nNext, fill the reservoir with fresh fluid. From here on out, the process is no different than bleeding brakes. Having a small, 2 foot section of clear tubing to fit over the bleeder screw makes the process easy to see when the old fluid has all been removed.\nSimply start at the rear of the car first, and bleed out the 2 rear calipers/wheel cylinders. You will know when the old fluid has all been removed when the rusty, brown fluid is gone and fresh, clear fluid is flowing through the tube.\nThen, move on to the fronts, being sure to re-check the master cylinder reservoir after each wheel is bled. \n\n3. Top It Off\n\nAfter your last wheel, fill the reservoir back to the fill line and you\u2019re done!\n\nHow Often Should You Change Your Brake Fluid?\nThat is a great, and often debated question because it\u2019s one of the few fluids that car manufacturers do not normally set a change interval. A good practice though is every 3 years or 30,000 miles.",

        "title": "DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 Brake Fluid: What's the Difference?",
        "content": "How Brake Fluid Works\n\nBefore we start explaining the difference between DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid, you need a basic understanding of what brake fluid does. This will give you an idea of how the different ratings impact your brake system performance.\nMost cars use a hydraulic braking system. When you press the brake pedal, this pressure sends brake fluid into your calipers, which press the pads into the rotors. As you apply more pressure, the pads and rotors will generate more friction and the car will come to a stop more quickly.\nWithout brake fluid, you won\u2019t be able to stop. Additionally, you should change your brake fluid from time to time, because it does go bad over time. It can absorb moisture, which can prevent your brakes from working properly. Bad brake fluid can cause your brake system to malfunction, which can be deadly. Ultimately, maintaining your brake fluid is crucial for safe driving.\nFor those wondering why moisture is so bad for the fluid, it is simple. Fresh brake fluid has a boiling point that is a higher temperature than would be produced while braking. However, water has a much lower boiling point and can boil from the temperatures produced during braking.\nMoisture which has been absorbed by the brake fluid can boil, releasing gas. With this gas in your braking system, pressing the brake will simply compress the gas, instead of pushing the brake fluid to your rotors. Essentially, boiling brake fluid may lead to you hitting the brake and the pedal simply going to the floor without slowing the vehicle. This is why regularly replacing your brake fluid is important.\n\nWhat are Brake Fluid Ratings, and What do They Mean?\n\nThe ratings are developed in regard to your brake fluid\u2019s boiling point. Boiling points are broken down into two categories. The dry boiling point is the boiling point for fluid that hasn\u2019t been contaminated with water or other pollutants. The wet boiling point is the boiling point for fluid that has water. Traditionally, these are rated as DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid. The DOT here stands for The Department of Transportation, the group which defines the ratings.\nTypically, when comparing DOT 3 vs. DOT 4, DOT 3 brake fluid has a dry boiling point of 401 degrees Fahrenheit, and a wet boiling point of 284 degrees Fahrenheit. Given the fact there is no standard formula for most brake fluids, this is an estimated boiling point, and the exact boiling points for these may vary. Typical DOT 3 fluids easily exceed these values. DOT 3 fluid typically includes 80% glycol ether base which is one of the factors that contribute to water absorption.\nDOT 4 Fluids both have higher Dry Boil Points and wet boil points which are required in brake systems that produce more heat due to faster speeds, heavier towing loads, etc. DOT 4 absorbs moisture faster than DOT 3 brake fluids and should be changed more regularly. DOT 4 fluid typically has 50 to 65% glycol ether base with 20-30 % Borate Ester which helps resist the boiling of the fluid, meaning you have 3.7% moisture in your DOT 3 fluid the fluid will boil at roughly 290\u00b0F. The same amount of moisture in your DOT 4 Brake Fluid will boil at around 330\u00b0F. The DOT 4 fluid will absorb that 3.7% water amount 20% faster than a DOT 3 Fluid.\nWhen examining DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 brake fluid, the boiling point and lifespan are the most notable distinctions between types. You\u2019ll have to replace DOT 4 more often than DOT 3 brake fluid.\n\nDOT 3 vs DOT 4 Brake Fluid\n\nWhen comparing the differences between the two, you should keep in mind that as there is no standard formula for brake fluids, and each type of brake fluid may contain different compounds or chemicals, there are only a few differences that distinguish DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 brake fluid. \nThe primary differences between the two include the following:\nDOT 3 brake fluid will absorb less water than DOT 4 from the air over time, meaning you\u2019ll need to have your fluid changed less frequently.DOT 4 brake fluid has higher dry and wet boiling points, making it safer for higher temperatures.\nUltimately, the difference between DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluids lies in their ability to handle the heat and water absorption. When you need your brake fluid changed, you should consult your owner\u2019s manual to see what type of brake fluid your car recommends. You should not mix different types of brake fluid, as this can cause your brakes to malfunction due to incompatibility. \nIf you\u2019re uncertain what type of brake fluid you\u2019ll need, you can reach out to us at AutoZone and one of our team members will help you determine what your vehicle requires.",

        "title": "How to Fix Squeaky Brakes",
        "content": "Why Are Your Brakes Squealing?\nIf you want to stop brake squeal from happening, you\u2019ll need to first understand why your brakes are squealing. The source of the squealing can depend on a variety of factors. A constant squeal when pressing the pedal can often simply be brake pads that are worn down to the wear indicators, where are metal tabs on the brake pads. These tabs are designed to tell you it\u2019s time to change the brakes! If the squeak is less drastic, only happens when you\u2019re barely touching the pedal, or seems to have a pulsing rhythm to it, the chances are the pads are vibrating\u00a0when light pressure is applied, causing a squeak. This can be caused by several different\u00a0things:\n\nSticking caliper\u00a0slides\u00a0causing the pads to drag on the rotors\u00a0\nOld, worn out brake hardware pad clips\u00a0\nLack of lubrication on pad/caliper contact points\u00a0\n\nBelow, we will cover what each of these mean and entail.\nWorn Brake Pads\nMost brake pads come with mechanical wear indicators that serve one purpose; to notify you that it is time to change your brakes. This indicator will begin making contact with the brake rotor once the pads have worn down below their effective service life, which is usually when the pads have about 1/8-1/4\u201d of material left. At this point, you will hear a nasty squeal any time you press the pedal, and no matter how hard you press it. At this point, it is time to change the brake pads.\nWorn and Damaged Hardware\nBrake hardware, and more specifically, the pad clips that secure the pads in their position, is possibly one of the most over-looked parts of the brake job. Many brake pads today actually come with the clips in the box, and many jobbers still overlook changing these valuable clips out! While it may not look like it, brake hardware is spring loaded, and over time, loses its tension ultimately causing a squeaking sound when you brake. Its primary purpose is to keep the pads secure in their location on the caliper, and keep any micro-vibrations or movement of the pads to a minimum. Over time, these clips go through a massive amount of heat-cycles, and eventually lose their ability to properly have spring tension. They are made to only last the lifetime of the pads \u2013 so every time you should change these clips! \nMoisture Buildup or Lack of Lubrication\nAfter a period of disuse for your vehicle, you may notice the first few times you hit the brakes, they squeak. This is actually relatively normal, as moisture builds up on the brake pads when they\u2019re not in use. This forms rust, especially on the rotor, which can cause squeaking or a rough rubbing sound as it wears off. What is important, however, is properly applying lubricant to not only the brake pad edges that contact the caliper, but removing, cleaning, and properly lubricating the slide pins that most calipers use to \u201cfloat\u201d the caliper in between the rotor. Without these parts being properly lubricated, noise can happen. These pins live a rough life, through constant heat cycles and water, mud, and salt, and snow. Over time, the lubricant these pins glide on breaks down, and turns to rusty muck. Eventually, the pins seize, and this can cause a caliper to hang up, not relax pressure, and prematurely wear one brake pad before the other. Before this happens, the tell-tale sign is squeaking or noise. When doing a brake service, make sure the pins are properly cleaned or replaced, along with their rubber boot seals, and the cavity in the brake caliper hanger is properly cleaned out and lubricated.\nYour Brake Pad Material\nThe last common cause of squeaky brakes has to do with the brake pads themselves. There are multiple types of brake pads, and one of the types, semi-metallic brake pads, is known for producing an occasional squeaking noise. Lack of uniformity in the pads may cause squealing, which is a known issue with this type of pad.\nHow to Stop Brakes From Squeaking\nNow that you understand the factors that can contribute to why your brakes are squealing and what the most common causes are, you\u2019re ready to tackle the problem itself. There are several steps you can take at home doing a brake replacement that can help stop these issues. Or, if you need to ask a professional for help, seek out one of our Preferred Shops in your area for help.\nIf you are confident you can safely repair your own brakes, we\u2019ve outlined the steps you can take for at-home repairs below.\n\nRonnie with AutoZone is here to help your learn how to stop your brakes from squeaking.\n\n1. REPLACE THE BRAKE HARDWARE\n\nAs stated before, it\u2019s essential that brake hardware is changed every time you change your brake pads. This means changing the pad clips, removing and cleaning the slide pins, and replacing the pin boots if they are cracked or damaged. If your brake pads don\u2019t come with the pad clip hardware, they can be purchased separately at this time. Many times, it\u2019s more cost-effective to simply opt for the better-quality brake pads that already have the hardware included. \n\n2. REPLACE YOUR BRAKE PADS\n\nIn some cases, your brake pads are the issue in regards to your squeaky brakes. Whether your brakes contain contaminants, have simply worn down over time, or have become glazed, it\u2019s possible that replacing them can solve your issue. We always recommend replacing the rotors with new pads, as well as new hardware. If you are re-using your old rotors, it\u2019s important to have these rotors machined and resurfaced. New brake pads may squeak during the first few uses. However, the sound should quickly dissipate through use.\n\n3. APPLY LUBRICATION TO CONTACT POINTS\n\nAs we mentioned previously, another reason your brakes are squeaking may have to do with a lack of lubrication between the contact points on the edge of the pads, where they meet the pad clips and caliper. The other place that is absolutely critical is properly lubricated is the slide pins. Make sure these pins are properly cleaned with a wire brush or Scotch pad, and you can clean out the pin bore (cavity) in the caliper hanger with a wire bristle bottle brush (sometimes referred to as a gun-cleaning brush). Really bad rust and corrosion in this cavity can be cleaned out with a drill bit just slightly smaller than the bore size of the pin. Simply run the drill bit down into the hole by hand to help loosen up some of the caked on rust and gunk, then rinse out with brake parts cleaner. Once done, re-apply brake lubricant to the pin and bore. \n\n4. CONSULT THE PROFESSIONALS\n\nUltimately, the above maintenance tips should help you fix squeaky brakes. Keep in mind that, in some cases, it simply has to do with the material your brake pads are made of. However, if you take care of all of your brake maintenance and still find that you have issues with squeaky brakes, you may want to consult a professional mechanic for additional help.

        "title": "What Is Traction Control?",
        "content": "What is\u00a0Traction Control?\n\nSo, what does traction control do? As its name suggests,\u00a0traction control\u00a0is a vehicle safety element that allows vehicles to take full advantage of road traction, especially when there is not much of it. That is, the system controls your vehicle\u2019s performance when driving conditions on the road result in low traction stemming from insufficient friction between your tires on the road. Low friction on the road may be due to snow, rain, ice, gravel or something else. When cornering, it can result from incomplete contact on the asphalt as your vehicle slightly leans in the turn.\nWhen you try to accelerate, your vehicle\u2019s tires must grip the road. If there is not much traction, your wheels may slip. That is, your tires may spin rapidly without moving your vehicle forward. When necessary, your car\u2019s traction control system engages. The system uses whatever traction is available to keep your car moving, most frequently it does this by slowing the wheel that is losing traction using the\u00a0ABS system\u00a0or an electronic throttle system.\nUnfortunately, if there is no available friction, the traction control system cannot create its own. Therefore, if you are driving on a nearly frictionless road, such as an ice-covered one, your vehicle may perform the same whether or not the traction control system engages. Still, because all roadways offer at least some friction, your vehicle\u2019s traction control system is likely to make a noticeable difference, and could even prevent an accident.\n\nA Brief\u00a0History of Traction Control Systems\n\nLuxury vehicle manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, and others including Toyota began installing traction control systems on some high-end sedans in 1987. Nonetheless, the technology first appeared in the early 1970s on a few powerful rear-wheel drive vehicles. Today, virtually all cars with anti-lock brakes feature some type of traction control.\n\nHow Does Traction Control\u00a0Work?\n\nTraction control can be incredibly useful when accelerating from a stop at a low-traction intersection. It can also assist you when climbing an icy hill.\nThe mechanics are reasonably simple. The system functions a lot like your vehicle\u2019s anti-lock braking system. In fact, on most modern vehicles, anti-lock brakes and traction control systems are integrated.\nTo understand traction control, you must understand the parts that make up the system. Typically, traction control uses the following three components:\n\nA hydraulic moderator\nWheel-speed sensors\nAn electronic control module\n\nWhen you are driving,\u00a0wheel-speed sensors\u00a0relay how quickly each wheel is moving. If one wheel starts to spin faster than the others, there is a good chance that wheel has lost traction or is skidding. The\u00a0electronic control module\u00a0uses an algorithm to determine when to engage the hydraulic moderator. This, in turn, activates the brakes in quick pumps to reduce wheel speed and improve traction.\nIn more advanced traction control systems, the vehicle\u2019s engine also comes into play. With these vehicles, if a wheel is losing traction, engine power to the wheel decreases. Whether you have a conventional traction control system or an engine-incorporated one, the result is the same: wheel speed drops to improve traction.\nTraction control systems engage automatically. As such, you may not realize there is a traction issue, until the light illuminates on your\u00a0instrument cluster. On the other hand, if your vehicle has a traction control system that involves decreasing engine power, you may feel a minor vibration when the system engages.\n\nWhat are the\u00a0Pros and Cons?\n\nClearly, traction control systems are beneficial in low-traction situations. After all, no driver wants to spin out of control when trying to move forward, or really ever. Still, traction systems can be problematic in some driving conditions. For example, if you are getting your vehicle unstuck from a very slippery or soft surface, all of your wheels may have difficulty gripping. If your vehicle\u2019s engine cuts the power to four wheels, you may not make enough power to get unstuck.\nTo combat this problem, many vehicles give the driver the option of turning off the traction control system. Typically, this involves depressing a button on the dash or interior console. If you do so, your wheels continue to receive full power. While they may spin, you may have sufficient forward motion to get unstuck. Once you\u2019re unstuck, it\u2019s generally wise to put the traction control back on again.\nYou should realize, though, that while many vehicles allow you to disable traction control, pushing the button may not completely override the system. Nonetheless, these vehicles often offer you the opportunity to select a low-traction setting. Once you pick the right option, your vehicle delivers reduced torque that both controls wheel spin and delivers forward motion.\nTraction control may also lure drivers into a false sense of security. The system is made to help you out if you skid, but it\u2019s not license to drive like mad. While the system is one of many safety features on your vehicle, you can diminish its effectiveness by driving improperly. For example, if you are speeding for conditions, your vehicle\u2019s traction control system may not do much good. Furthermore, if you follow too closely, you may slide into another vehicle or a stationary object before your vehicle\u2019s traction control system has an opportunity to stop the skid.\n\nCommon Problems\n\nAs with any complex system, your vehicle\u2019s traction control may wear out or break completely. Fortunately, if there is a problem, a warning light will illuminate on most vehicles. Here are some common problems with traction control systems:\n\nBad wheel speed sensors \nElectrical shorts \nConnector failure \n\nDiagnosing a problem with a traction control system can be challenging. Nonetheless, if you have an OBD-II diagnostic reader, an issue with the traction system may register a trouble code. You should realize, though, that a traction light may illuminate if your vehicle goes into limp-home mode. This may be due to a problem with the traction control system or another component on your vehicle.\nNow that you understand what is traction control, you can better plan for using your vehicle\u2019s enhanced safety features. You can also monitor your traction control system for signs of disrepair or damage. If you see any, find the high-quality replacement parts and tools you need for your project and order them today.",

        "title": "Bad Brake Caliper Symptoms",
        "content": "Brake Calipers Explained\n\nYou may be used to\u202freplacing your brake pads, but brake calipers also need to be replaced, as over time they lose their ability to clamp and relax the brake pads when the pedal is depressed and released. Calipers house a powerful piston that uses the pressure of the\u00a0hydraulic brake fluid\u00a0to press brake pads against the brake rotor. When working correctly, your calipers glide in and out effortlessly as you press the brake pedal \u2013 applying pressure when you press the pedal, and relaxing just enough to allow no slack in the pedal when not in use.\nWhether you have fixed or floating calipers, the same signs of damage apply. Pull into your garage and inspect your brake pads, calipers, and rotors for signs of damage or malfunctioning. Floating calipers are particularly susceptible to sticking and are by far the most common calipers. Fixed, multi-piston calipers can have issues as well though. Look carefully at your entire brake system before blaming your calipers. A\u00a0car\u2019s brake system\u00a0relies on a number of components for smooth braking, so any issue with your brake pads, rotors, brake fluid, or other component can produce similar signs of bad braking.\nMost vehicles have a series of sensors that alerts you to a brake malfunction. The\u00a0brake light\u00a0indicates when sensors detect something wrong with the system, but that system in most vehicles is very limited. The brake light will often trigger on low brake fluid, pressure, or pads that are worn down to the point of needing replaced \u2013 if your car is equipped with pad sensors. In a perfect world, your brake light would always illuminate at the first signs of trouble and you could safely repair your brake system before losing any braking power or efficiency.\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t always the case. Inspect all the relevant brake components for an issue. This light may also be caused by an electrical issue or damaged sensor.\n\nIdentifying and Preventing a Bad Brake Caliper\n\n1. Unusual Noises, Smells, or Pulling\n\nThe first diagnosis of a bad brake caliper can be done while driving. A malfunctioning caliper issue can cause your vehicle to pull to one side as you brake. This is due to unbalanced braking. When one caliper works and another doesn\u2019t, your vehicle will jerk to one side as you attempt to slow down or come to a complete stop.\nSquealing, grinding, and metallic scraping noises while braking are all signs that your brake pads are probably worn thin. At this point, it\u2019s just a matter of determining whether the pads are simply near the end of their life, or did a caliper cause premature failure. At the same time, a stuck caliper that is applying constant pressure to a brake pad or pads will cause that side of the car\u2019s braking system to get extremely hot. This is often noticeable when you get out of the car and smell a burning chemical smell near one of the front wheels. This is the brake pad material\u2019s bonding agents that are super-heated and giving off this smell.\n\n2. Open-Wheel Resistance Test\n\nDuring inspection or replacement of brake pads, one of the quickest and easiest ways to check if both calipers are relaxing properly is to simply test open-wheel resistance. In the old days, this is the way that you would test your drum brakes to insure that both were adjusted properly and at the same consistency. Once the vehicle is jacked up and secured, gently turn both front wheels. On a 2WD car, this should be easy, and both tires should turn with just a slight amount of resistance, and the SAME resistance. You should also hear the brake pads just barely pressing against the rotor. On a 4WD or AWD vehicle, you may need to put the vehicle in neutral or the transfer case in neutral to allow the front wheels to turn. Check the resistance of both wheels as you slowly turn them. If one wheel encounters more resistance to turn than the other, this side\u2019s brake caliper may be suspect. Keep in mind, some calipers can intermittently stick or hang-up, and if that\u2019s the case, if it\u2019s not hanging up at this time, both wheels will not encounter different resistance.\n\n3. Visual Inspection\n\nThe next step, regardless of whether you are changing pads or not, is to inspect the system carefully. When installing\u202fnew brake pads, inspect the old pads very carefully. On a properly functioning caliper, the brake pads \u2013 both inside and outside on each side should wear at relatively the same rate. If one pad is noticeably worn out compared to the other three, the caliper is usually the suspect. Likewise, if one side has both pads far worn out compared to the other side, a caliper is also suspect. A brake pad should also wear evenly across the pad itself, where as one section of the pad \u2013 an outer edge, should not be worn more than its opposing edge \u2013 indicating a pad that is not pressing flat against the rotor.\nRemember, after applying brake pressure in a braking situation, a caliper needs to relax when the pedal is lifted. In order to do that, the fluid and piston of the caliper has to properly retract, and in a floating-style caliper, the guide pins that make the caliper properly \u201cfloat\u201d in between the rotor need to move and relax when the caliper does. If any of these things don\u2019t happen, the caliper will continue to apply slight pressure to the rotor, and ultimately wear one or both pads out.\nOne of the most common situations that reveals a bad caliper is when the brake pads have very recently been replaced, only to suddenly hear grinding again several months later. The inspection reveals 3 near-new brake pads, and one completely worn down to the metal. Many times, the owner assumes that something is somehow wrong with the brake pad, when in fact, the caliper was not relaxing and continued to apply pressure on this one brake pad, until it was completely worn.\n\n4. Caliper Inspection\n\nA caliper can fail in a multitude of ways, and many times those failures aren\u2019t noticeable immediately.\nFirst, when removing the caliper, inspect the guide pins. In most calipers, these guide pins secure the caliper to the caliper hanger, and need to glide in and out effortlessly. The pins need to be cleaned thoroughly and properly lubed with brake grease before reassembly. Failed guide pins will usually become seized or extremely difficult to remove. Often times, the grease in them is baked solid, or is full of rust. Inspect the guide pin boots too as these boots seal and protect the guide pin. The caliper piston should retract when applying adequate pressure. If the piston is stuck, or difficult to push in, the caliper piston\u2019s bore is likely corroded and needs to be replaced. Keep in mind, even if the piston does push in but required more work than normal, the caliper has to be able to relax easily when pressure is not applied \u2013 so just because the piston pushed in does NOT mean the caliper is good!\nCheck the hanger assembly carefully for cracks or damage, especially around the guide pins. If the guide pins ride in the hanger, check that the bores are clean of old, nasty brake grease. One trick to remove solid, old grease from a guide pin bore is to use a drill bit of exact equal size as your guide pin. Run the drill bit by hand down into the hanger bore to break up the old, solid grease and rust. Be sure not to physically drill into the metal itself, you are just using the bit to clean the edges of the bore. Then, flush the bore with brake parts cleaner.\nIf your caliper fails any of these visual inspections, it\u2019s a good idea to replace the caliper. Keep in mind, many calipers do not come with the replacement hanger, so if your hanger does have signs of failure issues, you will need a semi-loaded caliper, or replacement hanger.\n\n5. Proper Prevention\n\nLuckily, several actions during the brake job, along routine maintenance can be done to ensure your calipers and braking system lives a good life.\nFor one, floating calipers need to be properly lubricated and completely clean on the guide pin and guide pin bore. Make sure when selecting a brake grease, you use one approved for braking systems that can with handle the heat and abuse it\u2019s going to see over a long time in the braking system. It is vitally important that the guide pins are given the proper attention. Replacements can be obtained if the ones you have cannot be cleaned. It is recommended that the boots are replaced at every brake job. A failed boot will allow water into the guide pin bore, and eventually seize.\nMany caliper piston failures occur because of corrosion in the piston bore. This is caused by water in the brake fluid, which is caused by a lack of flushing your brake fluid in regular intervals. Check out our other blogs on why flushing your brake fluid is vitally important. Remember, if you\u2019ve just changed brake pads in the last year and have already encountered brake pad failure again, the chances are very likely that a caliper is suspect that was missed in the initial inspection.\n\nFind Reliable Calipers Today\n\nFAQs\n\nNow that you know the top five signs of damaged brake calipers, you probably have many more questions. Here are some helpful FAQs as you determine the best course of action, given your unusual braking situation.

        "title": "How to Check Your Brake Fluid",
        "content": "Importance of Checking Your Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nLow brake fluid can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of your brake system. If you experience a spongy feeling while pressing your brake pedal, or your\u202fbrakes aren\u2019t working efficiently, it\u2019s time to check your brake fluid. Low or contaminated fluid can cause your brakes to fail while you\u2019re on the road, so check your fluid today and find out if you need more brake fluid.\u00a0\nThere is a range of related brake components that could be causing your brake fluid level to drop, so it\u2019s a good idea to inspect your entire brake system. If you refill your brake fluid and it doesn\u2019t solve your braking issue, inspect your brake pads, rotors, calipers, and brake lines for any signs of damage, extreme wear, or leaking brake fluid.\u00a0\n\nSigns of Low Brake Fluid\n\nThe hydraulic part of the braking system is closed, meaning that the fluid is not consumed and won\u2019t dissipate under normal circumstances. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be variances in the fluid level, though. One of the leading causes of low brake fluid is brake pad or shoe wear since more fluid is required in the lines to extend the calipers and wheel cylinders to stop your car. However, low fluid more often indicates a leak somewhere. No matter why its low, symptoms are usually similar and can include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe brake pedal sinks lower to the floor than normal when applied.\u00a0\nA spongy or inconsistent pedal feel.\u00a0\nLonger stopping distances.\u00a0\nA brake warning light is on.\u00a0\n\nPulling to one side when stopping.\u00a0\n\nSimply knowing how to check brake fluid and topping it up can resolve some of these symptoms immediately.\u00a0\n\nChecking the Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nWhen you\u2019re testing brake fluid, what are you looking for? Primarily, ensure the brake fluid level is between the minimum and maximum lines on the reservoir. If it\u2019s low, add fluid of the same type; you will see the specification stamped on the brake fluid reservoir cap. Secondly, check the condition. The fluid should be nearly clear or honey brown. If it\u2019s dark brown or black, it\u2019s overdue for a brake fluid flush.\u00a0\n\nWhere Is the Brake Fluid Located?\u00a0\n\nTo check your brake fluid, you first need to find the brake master cylinder reservoir. This reservoir is typically a plastic canister that is mounted near the firewall at the rear of the engine compartment. It\u2019s usually near the driver\u2019s side\u202fbrake booster, near the brake pedal.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re having trouble finding your\u202fbrake master cylinder reservoir, consult your owner\u2019s manual. Most reservoirs in vehicles newer than the 1980s are made of translucent plastic and have a line visible on the exterior of the reservoir to indicate the fluid level.\u00a0\nOlder vehicles have a metal reservoir with a clamp securing the lid. If you have an older vehicle and an\u202fanti-lock braking system, check your owner\u2019s manual for more information. When you\u2019re ready to open it, thoroughly clean off the lid before using a screwdriver to pry open the clamp and open the lid. You should see a fluid line on the interior of the reservoir.\u00a0\nWhen you need to open your brake master cylinder reservoir to check brake fluid, be sure you have everything prepared beforehand. Exposure to moist air can compromise your brake fluid. This can happen if you leave your brake fluid container open for too long. Depending on your climate and air quality, exposed brake fluid can be compromised in as little as 15 minutes. Keep your brake fluid container and master cylinder reservoir sealed as much as possible.\u00a0\n\nInspect the Fluid Level and Color\u00a0\n\nCheck to see that your brake fluid level is up to the recommended fill line. If it isn\u2019t, you may need to refill your brake fluid. However, low brake fluid can also be caused by worn-out brake pads. This is because, with thin brake pads, the caliper piston will need to go a little farther in, lowering the fluid level in the reservoir.\u00a0\nIf you see a low brake fluid level, inspect your brake pads or ask a professional mechanic to perform a\u202fbrake pad replacement. After your brake pads are replaced, then you can inspect your fluid level again and determine whether you need to top off your brake fluid or not.\u00a0\nEven if the brake fluid is at the correct level, inspect the color of your brake fluid. Dark fluid could have dirt and other contaminants in it. As dirt enters the system, or as your brake fluid breaks down over time, it becomes less efficient. This can begin to damage your hydraulic components, causing exponential damage and decreasing the efficiency of your brake system.\u00a0\n\nChecking for Leaks\u00a0\n\nIf your reservoir was empty or close to it, there\u2019s a great chance that you have a brake fluid leak. Inspect the brake system at every point to determine where the fluid is leaking from, then fix it right away. Applying pressure to the brake pedal while someone is watching the brake system can easily identify the area with a drip or spray from the problem area.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCommon Causes of Low Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nLow brake wear material is the most common cause of low fluid. Other issues that can cause the condition could be:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA leaking brake caliper piston.\u00a0\nA corroded or pinched steel brake line.\u00a0\nA worn or cracked brake hose.\u00a0\nA loose fitting or joint.\u00a0\nAlthough rare, a seal leaking fluid from the master cylinder to the brake booster.\n\nHow to Add Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nAs a general guide, consider replacing your brake fluid every two years. This will promote efficient use and keep your brake system operating safely for years to come. Choose the exact brake fluid recommended by your owner\u2019s manual or an experienced mechanic. Mixing brake fluid, using the incorrect formula, or overfilling your brake master cylinder reservoir can cause damage to your vehicle and prevent your brakes from working properly.\u00a0\n\nIf you need to top off your brake master cylinder reservoir, purchase the correct brake fluid and gather your safety gear. Brake fluid can be toxic and is highly corrosive, so you\u2019ll need to ensure that it doesn\u2019t come in contact with your skin, eyes, or any painted part of your vehicle. Any rags with large amounts of brake fluid should be disposed of at your local hazardous waste center.\u00a0\nAfter topping off your reservoir, simply replace the cap and test your brakes. Your brake system should be operating effectively. If you need to bleed your brakes and replace the brake fluid instead of simply adding more, consult your owner\u2019s manual and your local auto mechanic. Replacing fluid requires you to bleed the lines and refill your brake lines and master cylinder reservoir while removing any trapped air.\u00a0\n\nWe Can Help\n\nIf you are unable to check brake fluid on your own, or you think there may be a leak in your system, don\u2019t hesitate to contact a local AutoZone store. We\u2019ll discuss the right brake fluid for your vehicle and help you find the parts you need to restore your brakes and keep your vehicle operating safely.\u00a0\nIf you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\u202f\u00a0\n\nFrequently Asked Question",

        "title": "Why is My Brake Light On?",
        "content": "My Brake Light is on, What Do I Do?\n\n1. Start with the Parking Brake\n\nThis depends on when you notice the light. If you first notice the light when you turn on your car, you definitely don\u2019t want to drive it until you figure out what the problem is. The very first thing that you should check is to ensure that the parking brake is completely off. Depending on your car, the warning light for the brake system may be the same as the warning light for the parking brake. This means that if the parking brake is engaged when the car comes on, the brake light automatically comes on to notify the driver.\nThis warning exists because if you drive around with the parking brake engaged, it can cause wear and tear to your brakes\u2019 lining and this can cause them to wear out early.\nSo, the very first thing you should do is if the brake light is on when you turn on your car is to completely disengage the parking brake. If this does not fix the problem, then there is another problem with your braking system and you should not drive the car. (Also, in many newer cars the parking brake warning is distinct from the brake light.)\nIf the brake light came on while you were in the middle of driving, the first thing is not to panic.\nWhat you should do is drive the car to a safe area to park, and then slowly engage your brake to stop the vehicle. Once you have done this, call a tow truck to bring the car to a mechanic or your own garage if you\u2019re the type to work on your own car.\n\n2. Check Your Brake Fluid\n\nThe next thing you should check is what level of brake fluid in the braking system. Oftentimes, the brake light may go on if the fluid is low. If there is low braking fluid in your car\u2019s braking system, most likely there is a leak of some sort. This is a serious problem, because if there is no brake fluid in the hydraulic systems of your brakes, this means that the brakes won\u2019t function.\nA leak in your brakes hydraulic system should be taken very seriously. It is imperative to fix this or take your car to a knowledgeable mechanic quickly.\n\n3. It Might Be the ABS\n\nIf you have checked that the parking brake is entirely disengaged and there appears to be no leak in the brake fluid system, then it is possible that the problem is with your anti-lock braking system (ABS). Again, it depends on the model of your car, but in some cars the brake light comes on to signal an issue with the ABS system. In newer cars, however, it\u2019s likely that there is a dedicated ABS warning light.\n\nWhat Else\u00a0Might it Be?\n\nThe vast majority of the time, the brake light is on because of one of the above three issues. But, there is a less likely chance that the problem could be with a brake sensor. Another possible issue may be with the wiring in the car. That is, the brake light going off can be a symptom of an electrical issue.\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself where all of the warning lights are located on your vehicle. There is no standardization for this, but you can figure out where all the lights are located by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. After you turn on your car, for a split-second all of the warning lights should be illuminated. In that short time before they go off, you want to verify that all of the lights are indeed working. If you see that one of your warning lights is not going on during this check. you may want to get your car\u2019s electrical system checked out.\nWhile nobody likes to see any warning light go on, including the brake light, these lights are designed to prevent you from driving the car is something is wrong. Paying attention to the warning lights can save a life, even yours. These lights may be called \u201cidiot lights\u201d in jest, but they serve a vital purpose.\nMake sure that your braking system is up to date. One of the most important things you need to ensure that you replace regularly are your brake pads. Remember, the efficacy of your\u00a0braking system\u00a0depends on these pads, so make sure that yours aren\u2019t too run down. You can get the parts you need at your local AutoZone Store.

        "title": "What is an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)?",
        "content": "What are Anti-Lock Brakes?\n\nApplying a large amount of braking pressure can lead to a lock-up of the brakes, which locks the tires, making the car difficult to control. What\u2019s important to understand in the physics of driving is that a straight-line stop, even with tires in full lock-up is not where most of the dangers are presented. In fact, in most cases of a straight-line stop, a car will simply skid perfectly straight to a stop. When your brakes and tires are locked and not spinning, however, your car cannot steer, and herein lies the problem. In order for your car to properly steer and actually change directions, your tires need to be moving. Whether this is in perfect driving conditions, or wet, or snow \u2013 a panic stop is usually always coupled with another action \u2013 steering your vehicle to avoid what is in the road. When tires are in full lock, you cannot steer, your car simply plows forward.\nTo prevent this very issue, vehicles today are equipped with an ABS. Since the 1970s, with Ford and Chrysler leading the way, car manufacturers have begun including ABS on all their vehicles.\n\nWhat Do Anti-Lock Brakes Do?\n\nThis system uses a number of sensors to detect the motion of your wheels. When brake pressure is applied, sensors determine the exact moment that the wheel/tire is near lock-up. Before it locks up, the sensor transmits a signal to your ABS module, or controller, which then sends a signal to your ABS modulator, or individual ABS valves to systematically pump and regulate your brake pressure, meaning that no matter how hard you push, you cannot lock up the brakes. The timing of ABS brakes is carefully calculated to provide you with maximum stopping power while still preventing your tires from locking up completely. By doing this, you can apply maximum brake pressure and still steer at the same time.\nWhen ABS is activated, you\u2019ll feel a vibration as you step down on the brakes. Some vehicles have an ABS light that lights up when the system is activated. Even if you hold down on the brake pedal, you\u2019ll experience your brakes pulsing as your vehicle comes to a stop. Folks driving in winter conditions usually become far more acquainted to the ABS working, as during snow and ice it becomes very easy to trigger the ABS even with casual braking. Remember that while this may appear annoying, it is far, far better in a panic situation, because this still allows you to steer and avoid something in the road. You may not stop as quickly as if you\u2019d locked out your brakes, but you\u2019re also less likely to slide out of control. If your car lost traction, it could slide, and it probably wouldn\u2019t stop until it hit something.\n\nABS and Stability Control\n\nThe same sensors used to determine when to use your ABS are also used in many vehicles\u2019 stability and traction control systems. Since 2012, vehicles are required to come equipped with traction and stability control. These innovative features are designed to keep your wheels on the road and avoid tipping when navigating sharp curves and other dangerous features. They work by precisely applying brake pressure to certain corners of the car and can help counter a dangerous spin-out.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of ABS?\n\nAnti-lock braking offers you a number of advantages, although the system is far from perfect. When equipped in a vehicle, an ABS reduces the chances of the following situations:\n\nBeing involved in a fatal crash\nSliding off the road\nFrontal collision\n\nIn many of these instances, drivers attempted to lock out their brakes. Doing so would have caused their vehicle to slide out of control and potentially experience a life-threatening collision.\n\nPotential Disadvantages of ABS\n\nWhile ABS technology has come a long way since the early systems of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, the system still has some disadvantages. For instance, ABS can in some cases increase the stopping distance of your vehicle. It decreases the risk of skidding, but it could cause a collision when you would otherwise have time to come to a complete stop.\nAn ABS system adds a myriad of parts that can also fail. These parts, especially the ABS modulator, can be costly to repair.\nAn ABS system can be rather annoying on gravel, icy or snowy roads as many times even light braking can trigger the ABS. While this can hinder stopping in a straight line, remember the physics discussed earlier of attempting to steer and brake at the same time \u2013 you cannot accomplish this well without ABS and therefore can be quite valuable in winter or icy driving.\n\nWhat Does the ABS Light Mean?\n\nMost vehicles are equipped with an ABS warning light on their gauge cluster. This light is linked to a series of sensors that monitors your system and warns you of any performance issues. This light may mean that your system isn\u2019t working properly. When you see this yellow, orange or yellow ABS warning light, something in the braking system is suspect. This system, as well as your stability control and traction control, aren\u2019t working properly anymore and in most cases, all of these systems will be disabled when the ABS light is on.\nIf you see a red brake light, however, do not confuse this with your ABS light. This could be something as simple as the emergency brake activated, low brake fluid, or a pad-wear sensor. Some vehicles do also have a red ABS light, or blinking light, so it\u2019s good to read your owners manual and get familiar with each light and exactly what it means.\n\nHow to Fix ABS Light Problems\n\nLuckily, there is one very simple common fix for an ABS light, and that is your brake lights themselves. Many vehicles are wired so that a brake light bulb, even the high-mount brake light bulbs, are wired to trigger the ABS light if one of them is out. This is the quickest option to check. \nIf all brake lights check out, the car will need to be further examined to determine the cause. Many code scanners have the ability to read ABS lights, which can be done at home to help pinpoint what\u2019s wrong. If you do not have a scanner capable of checking these codes, you can also check our local preferred shops in your area, who can help assist with diagnosing any brake issues. Remember, that operating your vehicle that\u2019s not working properly could put you at risk of losing control of your vehicle in a panic situation, so it\u2019s best to tend to the problem. Aside from the common brake light bulb, these main components of the system can also cause problems:\n\nABS modulating unit \u2013 (this unit is under the hood, where the brake lines feed into it. It controls the function of regulating the pressure to the brakes). Some vehicles are also equipped with ABS valves that do this same purpose, one for each wheel of the car, rather than an all-in-one unit.\nWheel-speed sensors \u2013 these sensors are a magnetic pickup that reacts to a cog wheel, either located on the brake rotor or axle/CV axle. While they can fail, they can also become clogged with brake dust, rotor dust, or road grime and sometimes need to be cleaned.\nABS control module \u2013 This unit is a micro-processor, similar to a vehicle\u2019s ECU that receives and directs the signals from the wheel speed sensors. Sometimes, this is located within the Body Control Module, the ECU itself, or is a separate unit.\nWiring between controller and sensors\nABS fuse\n\nThese components can be either damaged, clogged, or loose. As mentioned before, ABS sensors can easily be covered in dirt and other grime, which prevents them from working effectively. The normal jostling of your vehicle could loosen wiring connectors, causing them to unplug from the controller or sensors. These issues don\u2019t require any new parts purchases, but will need to be solved before the system is operational.\nWhether you\u2019re confident in your DIY electrical repair skills or would prefer to take it to a reliable mechanic, it\u2019s important to fix the issue. Some issues, like damaged wiring or brake pad and rotor replacement, are quick and inexpensive. Others, like a new ABS modulator, can be very expensive just for the part. Either way, prompt repair work can keep your vehicle safe from collision and skidding.\n\nKeep Your Vehicle Stopping Safely\n\nWhile you\u2019re checking out your anti-lock braking system, it\u2019s a good idea to inspect your brake system. Worn-out brake pads, sticking calipers, or low brake fluid could all prevent your vehicle from braking effectively when you need it most. Now that you know what does ABS mean in a car, it\u2019s time to solve your ABS warning light issue. \n\nShop Brakes and Traction Control",

        "content": "Brakes That Are Noisy or Squeaky\n\nWhether you\u2019ve heard this on someone else\u2019s vehicle or your own, the chances are excellent that you immediately thought: \u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d You\u2019d also be right to think that, especially if the sound you heard sounded anything like metal scraping against metal. Contrary to popular belief though, this isn\u2019t necessarily the sound of vital brake components getting ready to go kaput.\nWhat you\u2019re actually hearing is the sound of a metal wear sensor doing exactly what it\u2019s meant to do \u2013 give you a heads up that it\u2019s time to think about investing in a new set of brakes. Squeaky brakes can also occur if your car has recently spent an extended amount of time parked under damp conditions. When that\u2019s the case, thin layers of rust can form on the vehicle\u2019s brakes, but they\u2019ll be gone after a short drive and several stops. If squeaking continues for longer than that, it\u2019s better to simply err on the side of caution and have your brakes looked at. Brake noise can also come from worn brake hardware. We recommend that you replace brake hardware with every brake job, even if it looks fine.\n\nLow Responsiveness\n\nHave you been feeling as if your brakes just really aren\u2019t as responsive as they should be? Does it seem like your brake pedal feels \u201cmushy\u201d lately or as if its sinking more than it should when you step on it? Does your vehicle take longer to come to a complete stop than it used to? It\u2019s probably not your imagination playing tricks on you. This is part of what happens when brake fluid is low and can even be a sign that there\u2019s a leak somewhere that should be addressed as soon as possible.\nOne warning sign to look out for is a puddle of actual brake fluid underneath your vehicle after it\u2019s been parked a while. Not sure what brake fluid looks like? Watch for a liquid similar to clean motor oil, but that feels less oily to the touch. You\u2019ll also want to look for other signs of low brake fluid. How do you know when you need brake fluid? Check your fluid reservoir, taking care to note both the level and color, or ask your mechanic to do it for you.\nDo your fluid levels seem to be just fine? If so, this could point to the brake booster or master cylinder beginning to fail, which should be addressed as quickly as possible.\n\nPulling, Bouncing, or Vibrating\n\nAny type of motion that feels strange or ominous when using your brakes could be a sign that something is wrong and that it is time to inspect your braking system. The following are just a few examples to keep an eye out for.\n\nSymptoms of Bad Brakes\n\n1. Pulling to One Side\n\nDoes your car pull noticeably to one side or the other when you\u2019re braking? It\u2019s probably not just a quirk or a sign that your car\u2019s simply getting old. It\u2019s likely a sign that your brakes aren\u2019t wearing as evenly as they should be. Alternatively, it could point to a caliper issue or the presence of something foreign in your brake fluid.\n\n2. Vibrating or Pulsing\n\nDoes your brake pedal ever feel like it\u2019s vibrating or pulsating? This could indicate that something is wrong with your rotors, as this sensation tends to occur when irregular wear or contamination on the rotor leads to a non-level surface.\n\nVisible Cues\n\nLast but certainly not least, you should get into the habit of visually checking your brakes every so often. You can do this by peering into the space between the spokes of your car\u2019s wheels. If you do this, you should see your brake pads pressing along the rotors of the braking mechanism. How do those pads look? Is there at least a quarter inch of pad present? Does it seem to be in good condition? Is there any exposed metal visible or anything else that looks worrisome?\nYou\u2019ll also want to pay close attention to that handy brake light on your dashboard. Sometimes it\u2019s a warning that your parking brake is engaged, but other times it\u2019s a sign that you really ought to have your brakes looked at sooner rather than later.\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s always better to be safe rather than sorry when it comes to your car, especially if you might be dealing with a potential brake issue. Make sure you take your vehicle in for regular inspections, even if nothing seems to be wrong, and definitely go in more often if you\u2019ve been having problems. You\u2019ll be glad you did.",

        "title": "How Often Do You Need New Brakes?",
        "content": "What\u2019s the Difference Between OEM and Performance Brake Pads?\n\nOften, it\u2019s the friction material in brake pads that differs, with performance pads generally using material that is formulated to operate at tolerances beyond that of the OEM quality control specifications. This means performance brakes will generally last longer, even when you are pushing their limits on a regular basis. Their lifespan is just as variable as any other brake pad, though, it is just generally longer than OEM pads.\nThe important thing to remember about all OEM parts is that they were chosen to reach a desired trade-off point between cost and performance. That means they will be cost-efficient as replacements for most drivers, but those who ask their cars for a little extra might want to invest a little extra in the parts they use when replacing worn out components.\n\nHow Often To Change Brake Pads\n\nIf you check your owner\u2019s manual, there is a thickness tolerance for brake pads, and when they are thinner than tolerance, it\u2019s time for new ones. Besides this though, nearly all brake pads are equipped with either an electronic pad sensor (many European vehicles) or a \u201cfeeler\u201d on the bad that once the brake pad is worn, it either triggers a light (in the case of the sensor) or you get a very high-pitch scraping noise any time you press the brake. This is done so that this metal feeler makes contact with the rotor in a fashion to make a noise, but not enough to damage the rotor. It\u2019s telling you it\u2019s time to change your brake pads! If you\u2019re using performance pads, you might find the manufacturer of the pad has a different tolerance than your manual lists. In that case, many people choose to change it by the guideline that would be earlier, to avoid the possibility of pushing the pad too far.\n\nWhat Happens if You Totally Wear Out Pads?\n\nThe reason for this minimal thickness and warning lights or feelers is pretty simple. Brake friction material against a rotor stops the car. Steel backing plate on a worn out set of brake pads against a rotor does not, and once you reach this point of grinding brakes, severe damage is being done to the rotor which will require replacement. If only one pad is worn out, the performance issue might be easy to compensate for, but the extra work the other brakes are doing will just wear them out sooner, and chances are the one opposite the worn-out pad is also pretty close in terms of wear.\nPads on opposite sides of the car tend to wear slightly differently, but usually not enough to make them have very different life expectancies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended by many professionals that you change pads at least a pair at a time, if not all wheels at once. The loss of performance and extra strain on the other brakes isn\u2019t the only issue, either.\nWhen you wear through a pad, the brakes still try to work, which means you\u2019re pushing material that isn\u2019t meant as a friction pad against the disc. This will absolutely damage your rotors, usually beyond repair and can even damage your calipers, making a simple brake job into an expensive and drawn-out repair. It\u2019s a lot better to replace pads a little early than to risk potentially more expensive-to-repair damages.\n\nSo, How Long Do Brakes Last?\n\nIt\u2019s a persistent, debatable question, even if it isn\u2019t an easy one to answer. If you really want to know how long a particular model has lasted different users, you need to look at reviews. If you start monitoring your own vehicles, eventually you will get a feel for the rate at which you\u2019re wearing the brakes down, and you\u2019ll probably be able to estimate when a replacement is going to be necessary. Most drivers get somewhere between two and five years on a set of brake pads.\nTrucks often face a different fate with brakes, depending on whether or not frequent towing or cargo-carrying is happening. If you frequently use your vehicle to tow, the chances are good you will cycle through brake pads much quicker.\nIt\u2019s not common for people to go longer than five years on pads if a vehicle gets driven regularly, and brake inspections are still necessary even if you\u2019re sure you know how fast you are wearing through a pad. Why? Well, brake inspections don\u2019t just look at the pads, they inspect the whole braking system. Sometimes, other components rust or wear down, even if you\u2019re replacing the pads as recommended, and an inspection will help catch those before they complicate and involve other parts, just like it does for your pads.\n\nHow Do Performance Parts Exceed Specifications?\n\nTypically, performance upgrades in any automotive category are built with upgraded materials and designs from the original but a compatible fitment. This means they might change the capacity of an operation, use materials that can tolerate higher temperatures and stresses, or introduce materials that were not available at the time of manufacture. It depends on the part and the performance purpose, but typically these changes help extend part life or improve performance in other ways, and very often both.",

        "title": "Disc Brakes Basics: Parts In The Braking System",
        "content": "Disc Brake Parts: What You Need To Know\n\nWhen it comes to disc braking systems, there are four parts you need to know: The pads, rotors, calipers, and hardware. The system is responsible for\u2026 well, braking. However, as with any other component within your vehicle, each aspect of the braking system serves a different purpose. Knowing what that purpose is can help you ensure your brake system and its parts remain fully functional at all times.\n\n1. Brake Pads\n\nThe brake pads are the outermost part of the braking system and true workhorses. The brake pads are one of the brakes components that contact and apply pressure and friction to the brake rotors \u2014 the discs that actually slow and stop the vehicle. The pads go under extreme stress every time you slow down and come to a stop, as they control the pace at which your wheels stop turning. \nBrake pads are not all created equal. There are two types of brake pads we recommend to vehicle owners:\n\nSemi-Metallic: Semi-metallic pads \u2014 often called \u201csemi-mets\u201d \u2014 provide ultimate stopping power. These pads contain metal fibers used to create the friction with the rotor. Semi-metallic brake pads are ideal for towing and heavy duty performance. Semi-mets have a tendency to be noisy and produce a brake dust, and due to their aggressive nature, the rotors generally wear faster. \nCeramic: Ceramic brake pads are the most popular option, as they\u2019re durable, provide for significant stopping power and come in ranges of quality. Ceramics use adhesion to provide the stopping power with the rotors, as they leave a layer of sticky transfer on the rotors. These pads are the most common and are used by many auto manufacturers on everything from cars to SUVs.\n\n2. Brake Rotors\n\nThe brake rotor is the heart of your braking system and therefore should be made of high-quality materials. When performing any type of brake repair, you should always examine your rotors for wear. We recommend replacing rotors with every brake pad change.\nMany people try to cut costs on rotor repairs by opting for an economy version. Lower quality metals or lighter rotors do not allow for your braking system to perform at the standards that restores your braking system to that of when it was new, increasing the distance it takes for your vehicle to stop. People also opt for having their rotors turned to save money, taking their rotors below the recommended minimum thickness. This leads to heat being trapped in the brake components, and ultimately leads to premature failure.\nIf price point is a concern, keep in mind that you will be replacing the same parts at a much shorter interval due to the increased wear and risk of premature failure.\n\n3. Brake Calipers\n\nCalipers have a much longer lifespan than any other part of the braking system parts. Though the lifespan varies based on a number of factors, mechanics and manufacturers generally estimate that calipers can last three to four times longer than brake pads. That said, if your caliper is going out, you want to diagnose the issue early on, before it puts you in harm\u2019s way.\nAn easy sign to identify that you need to replace the caliper or caliper hardware is if your brake pads show uneven wear. If one end of the pad is thicker than the other, or if one pad has more pad left, then you have an issue. Sometimes uneven wear is simply the result of corroded caliper pins or guide bolts, but if you can freely slide the pins in the caliper bracket, then it points to a caliper issue.\nOne of the surest signs you\u2019re due for a caliper replacement is a leak. If the presence of brake fluid is visible near the brake line fitting or in the pistons, the caliper has been exposed to the outside elements and needs to be replaced. A torn piston seal creates contaminated brake fluid, which will travel to other parts of the braking system such as other calipers and the master cylinder, and will need to be flushed.\n\n4. Brake Hardware\n\nAside from the four main brakes components, your brake system contains a few smaller parts. If you\u2019re lucky, your braking problems stems from one of these little guys, which would mean a quick, easy, and affordable fix:\n\nCaliper Pins: Most brake calipers contain two pins which help to move the caliper as pressure is applied to the brake pads. Sometimes the pins corrode, which can prevent them from doing their job effectively, and creates uneven wear and early failure of brake pads. Pull the pins and replace contaminated grease to allow them to move freely again. If they are too damaged, replace with new pins.\nCaliper Pin Boots:The pins mentioned above are installed inside of these rubber boots that allow for movement with protection from the weather and road debris. If torn, they lose their ability to do their job and can cause allow damage to happen in a hurry. Replace all torn or dry rotted boots to keep your system clean and closed.\nAbutment Clips: Abutment clips are the stainless pieces that the pads slide on within the caliper bracket. You should replace these clips with every brake job, as they are spring loaded and lose their tension and ability to aid the pads over time. We now include these clips in all of our Duralast Gold brake pad boxes.\n\nOnce you diagnose your braking issue, head to AutoZone to grab the parts you need to make the repair.  If you are having trouble identifying your problem, ask one of our employees to show you which parts are damaged and need to be replaced. If the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nShop Brake Parts",

        "title": "What Are Brake Pads and Rotors?",
        "content": "What Are Brake Pads and Rotors?\n\n1. What Are Brake Pads?\n\nBrake pads do a lot of work to stop your car and tend to need the most attention. The friction material on the brake pad will wear down over time and use. You\u2019ll know the brake pads are ready to be replaced if you experience any of these conditions:\n\nDecreased braking performance: As the brake pad friction material wears thin, braking efficiency can decrease, leading to increased stopping distances. This can be dangerous as an extra foot or two of braking distance can be enough to cause an accident. Inspect the brake pads and entire braking system if you are suspicious of this condition.\nSquealing: This noise is there for you. It\u2019s not fun to hear, but the pads have a metal sensor that\u2019s made to squeal when they are almost worn out. Some vehicles are equipped with electronic brake pad sensors. When the pad wears down, the sensor will turn on a dash warning light.\nGrinding: If you hear a grinding sound most likely the brake pad metal backing has come in contact with the brake rotor because of worn friction material. Immediate attention should be given to the brake system. At this time, you should consider brake pad and rotor replacement. The extra money spent to ensure the best braking performance could make a life or death difference in sudden stopping situations.\n\nWhen you replace brake pads, don\u2019t forget about the brake hardware. These components ensure the brake job is done right. Some brake pads come with new brake hardware.\n\n2. What Are Brake Rotors?\n\nDisc brake systems, which usually appear on the front two wheels of a vehicle (and often the rear as well), use brake rotors. The brake rotor attaches directly to the steering spindle or wheel bearing hub assembly. When brake pads apply enough pressure to the rotors, they slow or stop the vehicle. Brake rotors are subject to extreme pressure and temperature during braking, so ensuring you have well-maintained and high quality rotors is key to braking safety.                   \n\n3. What Are Brake Calipers?\n\nPart of the disc brake system, the caliper holds the brake pads in place. The caliper is a part of a hydraulic system where the brake fluid pushes a piston in to the brake pads, against the brake rotor, stopping the wheel.\n\n4. What Are Brake Drums?\n\nMany vehicles have drum brakes in the rear. The friction between the brake drums and the brake shoes assist in slowing or stopping the vehicle. Worn brake drums should always be replaced. Don\u2019t forget to replace the brake shoe hardware and wheel cylinders at the same time. Old wheel cylinders can develop a leak afterwards and create a dangerous braking situation.\n\n5. What Are Brake Shoes?\n\nBrake shoes are integral parts of drum brakes. Since they work by transferring kinetic energy to thermal energy, brake shoes create tons of friction, can get incredibly hot, and wear down over time. Because this friction is largely responsible for stopping your vehicle, making sure the brake shoes are in good shape by performing routine inspections such as when the tires are rotated. \n\n6. Master Cylinders and Wheel Cylinders\n\nMaster cylinders and wheel cylinders both control pressure via a combination of pistons and brake fluid. Since these parts interact directly with brake lines, they can fail if you don\u2019t maintain fluid levels or if you use a brake fluid that isn\u2019t compatible with the brake system. \n\n7. What Are Brake Boosters?\n\nThese components amplify the pressure you apply to the brake pedal and can improve your ability to slow or stop quickly. Without a brake booster, you may have to apply more than twice the normal pressure to stop your vehicle.\n\n8. Brake hoses and Lines\n\nHydraulic brake hoses and lines run from the master cylinder to each wheel. These parts hold the brake fluid and extreme hydraulic pressure when the brakes are applied. These brake components are subject to road debris, salt and other elements that can cause damage and lead to failure. Over time, brake hoses develop cracks and tears. Failure of a line or hose will cause catastrophic failure. They should be routinely inspected and replaced as necessary. \n\n9. What is brake hardware?\n\nBrake hardware consists of the metal abutment clips that the pads slide on inside of the caliper bracket. While they do not look like a wear item, they are spring loaded parts that lose their tension over time. When worn, they create vibrations that is heard in the form of brake noise and low stopping speeds. These clips should be replaced when replacing pads or pads and rotors.",

        "title": "What is Brake Fluid and How Does it Work?",
        "content": "Introduction to Brake Fluid\n\nBrake fluid is a hydraulic fluid specifically designed to operate in the high-stress environment of a braking system. Its primary role is to transmit the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver to the brake components at each wheel, bringing your vehicle to a stop. Without brake fluid, the entire braking process would be compromised, posing a severe threat to both the occupants of the vehicle and others on the road.\nAlong with its use in hydraulic function, brake fluid also prevents brake systems from corroding from the inside. It\u2019s hygroscopic, meaning that it attracts and absorbs water molecules, trapping them so they can\u2019t corrode the inside of lines, calipers, proportioning valves, and more.\n\nEvolution of Brake Fluid Technology\n\nThe history of brake fluid is a testament to the relentless pursuit of safety and performance in the automotive industry. Early brake systems used plain water as a hydraulic fluid, but this wasn\u2019t very effective due to freezing and corrosion. Over time, automotive engineers developed specialized brake fluids that could withstand the demanding conditions within the braking system.\nAdvancements in brake fluid technology led to the introduction of glycol-based fluids, commonly known as DOT (Department of Transportation) brake fluids. These fluids, categorized as DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1, offer improved boiling points and better overall performance compared to their predecessors.\n\nHow Brake Fluid Works\n\nTo comprehend how brake fluid works, you need to delve into the science of hydraulic systems. The braking system in modern vehicles is predominantly a hydraulic system, where force is transmitted through a fluid that\u2019s difficult to compress \u2013 in this case, brake fluid. When you press the brake pedal, it activates a piston in the master cylinder, which then forces brake fluid through a series of brake lines.\nAs the pressurized brake fluid reaches the brake calipers or wheel cylinders at each wheel, it exerts force on the brake pads or shoes. This force then makes them squeeze against the brake rotors or drums, creating the friction necessary to slow down or stop the vehicle.\n\nTypes of Brake Fluid\n\nThere are various types of brake fluid available, with DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 being the most common. These are the glycol-based varieties, and each type has distinct characteristics and is designed for specific applications.\n\nDOT 3 \u2013 Widely used in everyday vehicles, DOT 3 brake fluid has a lower boiling point compared to DOT 4 and DOT 5.1. Its dry boiling point, meaning new and uncontaminated, is 401 F whereas the wet boiling point is 284 F.\u00a0 It\u2019s compatible with most brake systems but may require more frequent replacement.\nDOT 4 \u2013DOT 4 brake fluid is often found in vehicles with more demanding braking conditions, such as those with performance features or towing capabilities. It offers a higher boiling point of 446 F dry and 311 F wet.\nDOT 5.1 \u2013 Similar to DOT 4 but with an even higher boiling point of 500 F dry and 356 F wet, DOT 5.1 brake fluid is suitable for high-performance vehicles and heavy-duty applications. It is glycol-based, like DOT 3 and DOT 4.\nDOT 5 \u2013 Unlike DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1, DOT 5 brake fluid is silicone-based. It does not absorb water, making it ideal for certain applications, but it\u2019s crucial to note that it is not compatible with other types of brake fluid. Its boiling point? The same as DOT 5.1.\n\nSelecting the appropriate brake fluid for your vehicle is crucial for optimal braking performance and safety. The recommended type of brake fluid will be found in your owner\u2019s manual, and it might be printed on the brake fluid reservoir cap too. Mixing different types of brake fluid isn\u2019t a good idea as it can compromise the fluid\u2019s properties and, consequently, cause issues with the braking system prematurely.\n\nMaintenance Tips\n\nRegular maintenance of your vehicle\u2019s brake fluid is essential to ensure your braking system continues to work as it should. Here are some signs that your brake fluid may need attention:\n\nThe brake fluid level is low \u2013 Check the brake fluid reservoir regularly and ensure it is between the minimum and maximum levels. There may be a leak present.\nThe fluid is discolored \u2013 Brake fluid should be clear or slightly yellow. If it appears dark or murky, it may indicate contamination and the need for a fluid flush.\nThe brake pedal is spongy \u2013 A soft or spongy brake pedal could indicate air or moisture in the brake fluid, affecting its performance.\nA brake warning light is on \u2013 Some vehicles have warning lights that illuminate when there is an issue with the brake fluid level or pressure. Pay attention to these warnings and address them promptly.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Kind of Brake Pads Should I Buy?",
        "content": "Brake Pads Explained\n\n1. What is a Brake Pad?\n\nBrake pads use friction to stop your vehicle. They rest inside a caliper and clamp on the brake rotor as a reaction to pressure you apply through the brake pedal. This clamping on the rotor creates friction, which slows and stops the rotor, the wheel and the vehicle. This friction generates heat and \u201cdust,\u201d tiny shavings of the pad that come off when the brakes are applied. Modern pads are typically made from a semi-metallic or ceramic compound, and carry a few differentiating features like slots and chamfers.\n\n2. Semi-Metallic Brake Pads\n\nSemi-metallic pads are made from a 30%-60% metal by weight composition that includes other materials such as graphite lubricant. Semi-metallic or Semi-met pads are excellent performers under pretty much any weather condition, and provide a firm braking feel. Because they come in a lot of compound varieties, you can find a quality pad of this type for daily street driving or hard performance braking. While semi-met pads are known for great performance and durability, they can also produce a large amount of dust, and are a bit noisier than ceramic pads due to added metals.\n\n3. Ceramic Brake Pads\n\nThe smooth, sophisticated choice, ceramic pads are known for their easy, quiet stops, and long-lasting performance. Made from a dense ceramic material, ceramic pads are favored for their quiet stops and consistent, all-around brake performance. Ceramic pads produce less brake dust. Most ceramic dust is vaporized by friction with the rotor, and the remaining dust is finer, lighter-colored and has a lower tendency to stick to wheels than dust from a semi-met pad. Although slightly more expensive, ceramic pads may be the best choice for day-to-day driving, but are not usually recommended for heavy duty hauling or aggressive braking. They also can under perform in cold temperatures, lacking, \u201ccold-bite,\u201d or immediate braking performance in extreme cold.\n\n4. What is a Chamfer on a Brake Pad?\n\nA chamfer is the angled edge of the brake pad. It controls the way the pad applies friction to the rotor, and significantly reduces braking noise.\n\n5. What is a Brake Pad Slot and Why Does It Matter?\n\nThe slot in the middle of a brake pad increases braking performance by separating braking friction into separate components, and providing a small gap for gas dust, and heat to escape when friction occurs.\n\n6. What is a Brake Shim?\n\nThe shim is a plate fitting between the pad\u2019s backing plate and the caliper. Shims are generally made of multiple layers of steel and rubbers to reduce vibration that often causes brake noise.\n\nOverall",

Safety First\n\nReplacing brakes shoes can release dusty hazardous materials into the air, especially if you are changing shoes on a car pre-1990\u2019s with very old shoes. Wear a mask, work in a ventilated area, and make sure no one else approaches the vehicle during brake maintenance. \nPrep your vehicle. Remove the wheel covers, then loosen the lug nuts. You want to do this before you lift the vehicle. Use a jack and stands to safely raise and support the vehicle. Also, the parking brake must be disengaged so the brake drum can be removed. For information on how to safely use a jack and stands, read our guide.\n\n2. Remove and Inspect the Brake Drum\n\nTo get to the brake shoes, you\u2019ll need to remove the wheel and brake drum. The brake drum may be stuck on the axle hub. You may need to apply penetrant to get the drum off, or in worse cases, use a hammer on the face of the drum to break it loose. In really severe cases, the drum will need to be cut off, but this is a rare case. Keep in mind that some brake drums on front-wheel-drive cars have a hub with traditional cone bearings in it, and they can be removed with the spindle nut like traditional, older rotors, hub-and-drum altogether. \nRemove any drum retaining screws or wheel stud retaining clips and slide the drum off. The retaining screws should be reinstalled later, but the clips may be removed permanently as these were used on the assembly line of the vehicle to keep a brake drum from falling off and bonking someone in the head. If you do see these clips, the chances are the brake shoes have never been serviced before. If the brake shoes are in tight contact with the inside of the drum, the brake adjustor screw will need to be shortened to relieve the pressure. This is accomplished by removing the small, rubber access port on the backing plate, and sticking a drum adjuster or large flathead screwdriving into the hole and turning the star wheel on the adjuster. Turning it one way will tighten the shoes against the drum. Turning it the other way will loosen the shoes. The drum should slide freely over the shoes for removal but often times will need the coaxing of a tap of a hammer, or gently pry from several pry bars. \nWith the brake drum off, clean and inspect it for heat stress cracks, hot spots, or deep gouging. Measure the inside diameter of the drum with a brake micrometer. The diameter specification should be stamped visibly on the outside of the drum. A brake drum with heat cracks, gouges severe hot spots, or that exceeds the specification limit should be discarded and replaced with a new drum. If you are within spec, these drums can be machined or \u201cturned\u201d at a machine shop.\n\n3. Remove the Brake Shoes And Hardware\n\nThe brake shoes are held in place by hold down and return springs. Specialty brake tools may be needed to make removal and reinstallation easier. The return springs have extreme tension. Use caution while removing and installing them. \nIt\u2019s a great idea to either use a specific repair manual for your vehicle, or take detailed pictures of exactly how the springs go on, their orientation, and how the self-adjusting cables and springs go on. Everything has a specific way and orientation, so make sure you have it right! Another good practice is to do one side at a time, and leave the other in tact as a reference for how the items all work and go on.\n\n4. Inspect and Clean the Remaining Brake Components\n\nWith the shoes and related system components removed, clean and inspect each item. It\u2019s always a good idea to install new brake springs. Wheel cylinder replacement is also recommended if you see any wetness around the rubber ends, or the rubber seals are cracked. A wheel cylinder may develop a leak after the brake job is completed, so if you choose to replace them, now is the time to do it. If a wheel cylinder fails, the brake system fluid will become low and soak the brake components. Replacement of these items will ensure smooth, reliable braking performance. \nClean and inspect the parking brake components and the self-adjustor assembly. The adjustment screw will need to be cleaned, and lubricated with anti-seize. You will notice several small raised portions of the backing plate where the brake shoes pivot and rest against the backing plate. Clean these areas with a wire brush, and apply brake grease or anti-seize to these areas. Before doing this, if outside, you can chose to clean the entire backing plate with degreaser and a hose to remove old brake dust.\n\n5. Re-Install the Brake Shoes and Components\n\nNow it\u2019s time to reassemble the brake parts. \nFirst, lay out your brake shoes. You will notice that on the brake friction material, two of the shoes have a shorter piece of friction material and/or are thinner. Two of them have a longer piece of material and/or are thicker. This is what is known as a PRIMARY and SECONDARY shoe. The SECONDARY brake shoe, or the one that is thinner with less length of material always is the leading shoe, or the shoe pointing towards the front of the vehicle. The PRIMARY shoe is the tailing shoe, going towards the rear. Do not mix these up! This is one of the most common mistakes made when replacing brake shoes. \nStart by installing the brake shoes with their hold-down springs, and the bottom adjuster wheel, noting it\u2019s correct orientation. Now, you can begin to install the springs and self-adjusting hardware, making sure to follow your manual or photos carefully. Be very careful with tensioning and installing new springs, as many can be very difficult to re-install. \nAfter assembly, you will need access to the brake adjustor star wheel when the brake drum is installed. It can be accessed through the backing plate or brake drum, depending on your vehicle \u2013 the same hole used to adjust the shoes when you removed them.\n\n6. Install the Brake Drum\n\nMake sure the brake shoes are clean and free of contamination. Slide the new or re-machined drum over the wheel studs and shoes onto the hub. If the drum won\u2019t fit, adjust the star wheel to collapse the shoes farther in, so the drum slides over. If you replaced the wheel cylinders, bleed them now. \nNow, use a brake adjusting tool or large flathead screwdriver now to adjust the brakes. To do so, reinstall the wheel and tire with several lug nuts. \nNow, spin the wheel slowly. You will be adjusting the star wheel through the backing plate until you just feel the brake shoes lightly contact the brake drum. Do not overtighten. You should barely hear, and feel the shoes contact the drum, and there should be a very small amount of resistance over the wheel free-spinning. \nOnce you\u2019ve accomplished this, your wheel/tire is ready for final lug nut torque. Once both sides are done, check brake fluid in the master cylinder, and prepare for a test drive.\nRe-install the wheels and properly torque the wheel lug nuts. Reattach the wheel covers. Re-check the brake fluid level in the brake master cylinder. Prepare for test drive.\n\n7. Test Drive\n\nOnce behind the wheel, press the brake pedal and make sure it feels normal. It should be firm with some initial travel. If the brake pedal seems to low, the brake shoes may need more adjustment or additional bleeding. Make sure the brake pedal travel is normal before test driving. Apply the brake pedal lightly during the initial test drive. It should be firm and smooth. The brake shoes will eventually seat. This will happen over time. Just make sure the brake pedal is firm and there are no strange noises or brake fluid leaks. Don\u2019t forget to check your brake lights and all your lights. \nOnce you\u2019ve had a few miles testing the brake shoes, it\u2019s a good idea to lift the car again, free spin the wheels and check for proper adjustment. From here, your self-adjusters should pick up and begin properly adjusting the brakes. Self-adjusters work when you apply brake pressure in reverse gear. As the brake shoes pivot against the drum, the adjusting pawl clicks the star wheel, and adjusts the shoes properly. If you re-installed everything correctly, these adjusters should properly work. Brake shoes require a little more attention to detail than brake pads, which are generally just \u201cchange and go\u201d.",

        "title": "How To Find and Fix Coolant Leaks",
        "content": "Understanding Coolant Leaks\n\nCoolant is an essential fluid. That is, if you do not have the right amount of fluid, you are asking for serious trouble that may include substantial engine damage. As such, you should routinely check your car\u2019s coolant levels. If you regularly find that you are adding new fluid to your system, there is a good chance you have a coolant leak.\n\nHow to Detect Coolant Leaks\n\nCOMMON SOURCES OF COOLANT LEAKS\n\n1. A BLOWN HEAD GASKET\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s head gasket seals the space between its\u00a0cylinder head\u00a0and engine block. If the head gasket fails, coolant, and engine oil may mix. You may also notice that coolant is leaking from the bottom of the engine and dripping onto the ground. Either way, a blown head gasket can be disastrous for your engine.\n\n2. A DAMAGED HEATER CORE\n\nYour\u00a0heater core\u00a0is essentially a small radiator that disperses heat into your vehicle\u2019s passenger cabin. While you cannot see the heater core, it may develop a coolant leak. If it does, fluid may accumulate in the plastic housing on the bottom of the heater core.\n\n3. A CRACKED OR DAMAGED HOSE\n\nCoolant may move through many\u00a0different hoses\u00a0under your vehicle\u2019s hood. If one of these hoses develops a crack or hole, coolant may leak.\n\n4. LOOSE OR WORN-OUT HOSE CONNECTIONS\n\nHoses in your vehicle\u2019s cooling system must connect to different components. Some connections may have\u00a0hose clamps, while others may attach on their own. Any place a hose connects, though, is prone to springing a coolant leak.\n\n5. A BROKEN RADIATOR\n\nModern coolant has anti-corrosive agents that help protect your radiator from damage. Still, sometimes radiators develop holes. If your vehicle\u2019s radiator has one, you may notice a leak in front of your engine.\n\nCoolant leaks are serious business any time of the year. That is, even though coolant is commonly called antifreeze, it is essential year-round. Therefore, if you have a car leaking coolant, you must take the leak seriously. Fortunately, finding a coolant leak may not be as difficult as you may think.\n\nFinding Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nOften, finding a coolant leak is simple, as you can see fluid dripping from beneath your vehicle\u2019s hood. You may also notice bubbles in the\u00a0coolant reservoir\u00a0or at a hose connection. You must be careful when checking fluid levels, though. If the engine is not completely cool before you remove the radiator cap, you may suffer a serious burn from escaping steam or hot coolant. Therefore, you should never open the radiator cap or the coolant reservoir when your car\u2019s engine is hot.\nTypically, a coolant leak presents itself in just a few ways. For example, your vehicle\u2019s engine may overheat. If this happens, the\u00a0temperature gauge\u00a0on your instrument panel is likely to move upward, perhaps into the red zone. You may also notice steam coming from under your hood. Or, your vehicle may stall. If your car has a low-coolant indicator light, it may also illuminate.\nTo locate a coolant leak, first look for puddles of coolant beneath your vehicle. If you see any, you probably have fluid dripping from somewhere in the system. With the car\u2019s engine running, look under the hood to see if you notice any fluid flowing out. If you do, trace the fluid to its source. Do not forget to check hose connections and components for leaks. Allowing your vehicle to climb to normal operating temperature and turning on the air conditioner increases pressure in your coolant system. This procedure may allow you to more easily detect a coolant leak.\nIf you cannot see a leak but you are losing coolant, you may need to perform a\u00a0coolant pressure test. A pressure tester is a hand-held tool that allows you to gauge the pressure inside your cooling system. If you have low pressure, you probably have a leak somewhere.\n\nFixing Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nThe best way to fix a coolant leak is to track down the location of the leak and repair the old, damaged, or ineffective part. For example, if you have a cracked hose, replacing it is the most effective way to\u00a0stop your leak. Some components naturally wear out over time. As such, replacing hoses, the\u00a0radiator cap, or the reservoir tank may eventually become necessary on older vehicles.\nYou certainly should keep an eye on hose clamps. With ordinary engine movement, clamps can work their way loose. Checking to see that clamps are always sufficiently tight may prevent a leak from forming in the first place.\nIf your leak is because of something more serious, such as a\u00a0blown head gasket, your fix is not so simple. While replacing a bad head gasket is the best way to go in the longterm, such a replacement is very labor intensive and expensive, and you may be able to use a\u00a0sealant\u00a0for less serious cracks or breaks. Sealant products may also work for holes in the radiator. If you are looking at a costly repair or replacing, trying a sealant first may be the way to go.\n\nFinishing Your\u00a0Project\n\nEven though you may never want to have to deal with a car leaking coolant, the problem is more common than you may think. You cannot ignore coolant leaks or any other issue with your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. Now that you understand how to find and fix coolant leaks, you are ready to tackle your project. To finish it successfully, always choose\u00a0high-quality replacement parts\u00a0and the right coolant for your vehicle. With some planning and a bit of effort, you can stop your vehicle\u2019s coolant leak and extend the life of its engine. \nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How to Check Your Coolant Level",
        "content": "Dangers of\u00a0Low or Contaminated Coolant\n\nThe radiator uses a series of tubes and hoses to transport coolant, or antifreeze, and cool down your engine.\nWithout enough coolant, your engine may overheat.\u00a0Engine cooling system problems\u00a0could arise if you don\u2019t have the right mixture of coolant, which is typically a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water. Finally, a leak in the system could contaminate your coolant and prevent it from working properly.\nDon\u2019t wait for your engine to overheat, keep an eye out for any signs of a coolant issue. Just like your oil, you should be inspecting your coolant level to prevent any dangerous situation before it occurs. A few minutes of simple inspection and maintenance can prevent a wide range of issues with your engine.\n\nCheck Your Coolant\u00a0Level and Color\n\nNow that you know some of the warning signs to check for, it\u2019s time to inspect your\u00a0radiator\u00a0and coolant reservoir. Make sure your vehicle is on level ground for accurate readings. You\u2019ll also want to wait for it to completely cool down, as your radiator and coolant can become extremely hot.\nOpen your hood and locate your radiator and\u00a0coolant reservoir. Some older vehicles don\u2019t include a reservoir, but most modern vehicles have a small tank for filling and checking the coolant level. The reservoir should be clear plastic, so you can easily see the level of coolant and the maximum fill line.\nBefore you top off your coolant, inspect your current coolant for any unusual coloring or contaminants. Coolant comes in a range of colors, so it\u2019s normal for it to be red, blue, yellow or green. However, if your coolant is colorless, rust-colored, has particles or is oily or sludgy, you\u2019ll want to have it inspected by your local mechanic. These are all signs of contamination that may indicate more severe issues like a\u00a0leak in your head gasket.\nOther warning signs to look out for include cracked radiator hoses and an extremely low coolant level. These need to be repaired, or your new coolant may leak out.\n\nHow to\u00a0Fill Your Coolant\n\nIf your coolant looks great and is just a little low, top it off with premium engine coolant. While IAT formula coolant is the most popular option for most vehicles, be sure to use the same coolant that\u2019s already in your vehicle.\nYour owner\u2019s manual will have more information about the correct type of coolant. Check to see if your brand of coolant needs to be mixed with water or comes pre-mixed. Adding pure coolant with no water can damage your radiator, while too much water mixture can prevent your coolant from working effectively at extreme temperatures.\nSimply top off your coolant to the top of the maximum fill line and close the cap. Make sure that no debris enters your radiator or coolant reservoir. Be sure both the reservoir and radiator caps are secured and start your vehicle.\n\nWhen to\u00a0Drain and Replace Your Coolant\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed any serious signs of damage to your radiator, or any unusual coloring to your coolant, it may be time to drain and replace it. It\u2019s a good idea to have a mechanic to perform these steps, as there could also be an issue with your head gasket or radiator.\nFirst, locate the plug on the bottom of your radiator. Place a\u00a0drain pan\u00a0underneath and completely drain your old coolant. Inspect your drain pan for any signs of particles or contaminants, as these are most likely caused by a cracked radiator or compromised hose. You\u2019ll need to perform additional repairs, or your new coolant will quickly become contaminated as well.\nRefill your coolant, making sure to bleed any air out of the system, replace the plug and top off your coolant reservoir. Start your engine and drive carefully to test whether there\u2019s any air caught in your system. Continue to inspect your coolant reservoir for any signs of a leak.\nNever refill your coolant when your engine is hot. Always wait for it to cool down. If you open a\u00a0radiator cap\u00a0when the engine is still hot, you could be burnt by escaping steam or hot coolant. Even after opening the cap, pouring cold or room-temperature coolant into your hot system could crack a hot engine block.\nCracked, bulging, and leaking hoses need to be replaced before you refill your coolant. When you inspect the radiator, you should take a look at all the hoses. You\u2019ll find them on the top and bottom of your radiator. Because of the extreme temperatures these hoses face, it\u2019s normal for them to begin to wear out and crack over time. After you\u2019ve drained your radiator, replace any damaged hose section for a sealed, secure system.\n\nShop for\u00a0Quality Coolant and Repair Parts\n\nNow that you know how to check antifreeze, it\u2019s time to pick up quality antifreeze. For the best brands and competitive pricing, stop by\u00a0your local AutoZone\u00a0today.

        "title": "How the Cooling System Works and How to Maintain It",
        "content": "Take Care of Your Cooling System\n\n8 Cooling System Parts You Should Check Regularly\n\n1. Accessory Belts Drive the Cooling System\n\nWhether your car has V-belts or a serpentine belt, the belt transfers power from the engine\u2019s crankshaft to the water pump to power the cooling system. Inspect belts to make sure they are not loose. Also, look closely for cracking, fraying or excessive rib-wear.\n\n2. The Water Pump Pushes Coolant Through the System\n\nIn order for the system to work, the coolant needs to move throughout the system. The water pump uses power from the crankshaft and serpentine belt to force coolant into the engine and through the rest of the cooling system. Allow your engine to run for a few minutes before inspecting your water pump. Visually check for leaks around the unit. Failure of your passenger compartment to heat properly can also indicate a faulty water pump.\n\n3. The Heater Core Helps Adjust Cabin Air Temperatures\n\nThe heater core is where the engine cooling system meets the cabin AC system. The core is where heat from the engine warms up cabin air, which also helps the coolant lose some heat before returning to the radiator to be cooled again. Inspect for signs of leakage indicated by fluid around the heater core or wet spots on your carpet. Constant presence of fog on the inside of your windshield can also mean that your heater core needs replacing.\n\n4. Heater and Radiator Hoses Carry Coolant Through the System\n\nCoolant hoses direct coolant between the other parts of this system. Make sure all hose connections are secure. Inspect for swelling, cracking and fraying. Also, make sure there are no collapsed or soft sections. Always check hoses while engine is cool.\n\n5. Cooling Fans Move Air Past the Radiator to Prevent Overheating\n\nRadiator fans increase airflow to help the system cool more efficiently. Make sure all blades on your cooling fan are in good condition and not damaged. A noisy fan blade is a good indicator of damage.\n\n6. Coolant Temperatures are Measured by the Thermostat Before Returning to the Radiator\n\nThe thermostat measures the temperature of coolant before it comes back to the radiator. This lets your car\u2019s engine computer keep track on how well the vehicle is cooling the engine, and ensure that the cooling system is operating correctly.\n\n7. The Radiator Exchanges Coolant Heat with Outside Air\n\nAs coolant flows through the radiator, cool air blows past the radiator, cooling the coolant before it is recirculated through the engine. Check your radiator fluid for the proper concentration in the coolant reservoir. Consult your owner\u2019s manual for the location of your reservoir. Most manufacturers recommend 50% antifreeze and 50% water mixture. Make sure the fluid reaches the \u201cFull\u201d line. If not, pour in enough antifreeze to reach the line. An AutoZone store associate can help you find the right antifreeze for your vehicle.\n\n8. The Radiator Cap Allows for Easy Filling\n\nThe radiator often acts as a reservoir for coolant, and this cap seals the system while providing easy access for when more coolant needs to be added. Make sure your radiator cap is always tight and secure so that it seals properly. Never remove it when the engine is hot. Here are some guidelines on when you should replace your radiator cap:\n\nRadiator caps can deteriorate after 40,000-50,000 miles\nAs a general rule, radiator caps should be changed when a thermostat, water pump or radiator is replaced. This will ensure the system is operating at the proper pressure\n\nFlushing and Filling is Easy as 1-2-3!\n\nRemember to flush and fill your radiator every 24 months or 24,000 miles.\n\nDrain your cooling system\nFlush with water and a quality flush product\nFill with 50%-50% or 70%-30% antifreeze water mixture. Use more antifreeze if you drive in extreme temperatures\n\nStop by your local AutoZone store for more helpful advice and everything you need to do the job right. Find an auto parts store near you.",

        "title": "What's Causing My Coolant Reservoir to Overflow?",
        "content": "WHAT\u2019S CAUSING MY COOLANT RESERVOIR TO OVERFLOW?\n\n1. COOLANT\u00a0LEVEL\n\nBe sure you have the proper level of coolant in your vehicle. Overfilling may cause overflowing.\n\n2. RADIATOR CAP\n\nCheap and easy to replace, this is the first thing to check. Your problem may simply be a loose or damaged cap not keeping coolant where it needs to be. The radiator cap is designed to allow access to fluids in a \u2018closed\u2019 system. The coolant used to cool the engine does so at maximum efficiency when kept at specific pressure. Check your owner\u2019s manual for proper cap replacement. The radiator cap comes in different pressures.\n\n3. THERMOSTAT\n\nMost of the rest of these problems will cause a check engine light to turn on, but they could have an issue and not be noticed by your vehicle\u2019s computer. A bad thermostat can improperly regulate fluid, and can lead to overflow.\n\n4. WATER PUMP\n\nHow to tell if your over heating problem is caused by the water pump. Faulty water pumps slow or stop the flow of fluid through the cooling system. The result is overheating of the engine. You will see coolant fluid on the ground and around the water pump when the water pump has gone bad. Water pumps either work properly or go bad in a hurry. There is no \u201ckeeping an eye on it\u201d for validation.\n\n5. RADIATOR\n\nIf the cap, thermostat and water pump are all fine, the reservoir is overflowing most likely because of a radiator problem. In older automobiles, the radiator was made of copper and aluminum. In more modern automobiles, the radiator contains a lot of plastic. The plastic radiator are light weight, but tend to ware out faster. Replacing the radiator is recommended over applying a patch if the leak is found.\n\n6. CRACKED HEAD OR BLOCK, OR HEAD GASKET LEAK\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing gas bubbles or some boiling in the liquid when you remove the radiator cap, a cracked head or block may be to blame. Do not remove a radiator cap from a hot engine to check. You can experience a shot of boiling water exploding under pressure. Your local repair shop can perform test to identify cylinder head or engine block cracks.",

        "title": "Common Cooling Problems",
        "content": "Common Cooling Problems\n\n1. Coolant leaks and fluid\n\nThe most common coolant issue is low fluid caused by a leak. A leak can occur anywhere in the cooling system from a cracked or worn hose and radiator to a leaking water pump seal or heater core. To check for leaks or cracks that aren\u2019t immediately visible, use a pressure tester. The pressure tester forces coolant through the system, making any leaks more obvious.\n\n2. Flush and fill\n\nWhen was the last time you flushed and filled your radiator? Electrochemical degradation from old coolant and contaminants can weaken the cooling system, leading to corrosion of the radiator and puts hoses, the water pump, thermostat and radiator cap at risk. A coolant flush and fill is recommended every five years or every 100,000 miles. If you\u2019re worried about an issue within this interval, you can use a coolant tester to measure temperature protection.\n\n3. Thermostat failure\n\nThermostats control the flow of coolant into the radiator by changing between \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 positions. When they fail, they stick in one of these two positions. If the thermostat fails in the open position, it will allow a continuous flow of coolant into the radiator, causing the engine to run inefficiently and other parts to incur extra wear. In this situation, your vehicle will not be able to reach operating temperature. A few ways to notice this issue are if the temperature gauge hovers around the C marker, if the check engine light comes on, or if the heater is blowing cool or just a little warm, but not hot. If the thermostat fails in the closed position, coolant flow is blocked completely and your engine will overheat. In this case, a dashboard light should surface, you\u2019ll notice the temperature gauge closer to H, staying on H, or jumping to H very quickly while driving, and the thermostat needs to be replaced immediately.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Car Axle",
        "content": "The Symptoms of a bad car axle\n\nHow to Tell if Your CV Axle is Bad\nYour CV axle has an inboard joint on the transmission side of the axle, as well as an outboard universal joint on the wheel side of the axle. Both of these joints are protected by a rubber cover called a CV boot. Your CV boots look like a black rubber cone-shaped accordion and will have metal retaining clips or bands on either end to keep them place.\nThe CV boot is filled with grease to lubricate the moving CV joint and protect it from corrosion. If a CV boot cracks or splits, the grease can come out and foreign particles can make their way into the boot, resulting in damage to the CV joint. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll begin to hear the tell-tale signs of a bad car axle.\nIf the inboard joint is beginning to wear out, you will feel a vibration and hear noise during straight-line acceleration.\nIf the outer CV joint is wearing out, you\u2019ll notice popping and clicking noises when you turn sharper corners.\nChecking for a bad CV boot is as simple as doing a visual inspection of the boot. Take the tire off and use your fingers to check for cracks or leaking grease on the boot. If it feels soft and pliable, with no cracks or grease leaks, your symptoms are probably coming from a different issue. It is possible for a CV joint to fail with a good CV boot, but usually, the two go hand in hand.\nIf the unthinkable happens and one of the CV joints breaks, you will lose all power on that side of the vehicle and you could severely damage your transmission.\n\nThe Tools Needs to Replace a CV Axle\n\nMost of the tools needed to tackle this job will be in the average home mechanic\u2019s toolbox, but there are a few special tools that you\u2019ll need to complete the task.\n\nFloor Jack and Jack Stands. You will need to elevate the car to take the wheel off and work on the CV axle. Always use jack stands for safety.\nRatchet and Socket Set. If you want to do any work on your car, invest in a ratchet and socket set as well as sets of wrenches, screwdrivers, and pliers.\nTorque Wrench. All the suspension components you remove, as well as the CV axle, will require the nuts to be torqued to specifications in your repair manual. These are available through the AutoZone Loan-a-Tool program, but you might consider buying one if you intend to work on your car regularly.\nNeedle Nose Pliers. One type of plier worth mentioning on its own is the needle nose, because you\u2019ll need a set to remove cotter pins from a few of the nuts in this repair.\nHammer. A hammer will be needed with the pickle fork and when separating the spindle from the wheel hub.\nPickle Fork or Ball Joint Separator. A pickle fork is also known as a tie rod end separator and that\u2019s exactly what it does. This tool is the safest and easiest way to remove tie rod ends without damaging the existing parts. A ball joint separator does the same for ball joints. Check AutoZone\u2019s Loan-a-Tool program for these.\nAxle or Spindle Nut Socket. You\u2019ll need this extra-large socket to take the nut off your axle on the outside of the wheel hub. These are available through AutoZone\u2019s Loan-a-Tool program, if you would prefer not to purchase one outright.\nBreaker Bar. This is a long-handled bar with a socket fitting on the end for your spindle nut. You\u2019ll need it to break the nut free, since it\u2019ll be solidly torqued to the spindle.\nRepair Manual. A good repair manual for your vehicle can save you a lot of time and frustration.\n\nSteps to Replace the CV Axle\n\nHow to replace your Axle\nThis is a job most home mechanics could do in an afternoon, so read on for the basics of how to replace a CV axle.\n\nBlock the wheels to prepare for jacking up the vehicle. \n\nUse your floor jack to elevate the vehicle and immediately secure the vehicle with jack stands. \n\nRemove the lug nuts and take off the wheel. \n\nIdentify the spindle at the center of the wheel hub, remove the cotter pin with pliers and take off the nut retainer, before removing the axle nut. You can insert a screwdriver through the caliper into the brake rotor to keep it from rotating while you loosen the axle nut. Use the breaker bar and axle nut socket to remove the axle nut. \n\nCheck to see that there is no pressure on the suspension from the struts or springs before taking off any of the tie rod ends or ball joints. If there is downward pressure from springs, you could seriously injure yourself when releasing suspension components. \n\nDetach the tie rod end and ball joints from the wheel carrier. \n\nThread the axle nut back onto the axle so that it is flush with the end of the axle, so that you can use your hammer to release the axle from the center of the wheel hub. \n\nRemove the nuts or bolts from the transmission side of the CV axle and then pull the CV axle out carefully.  \n\nReplace the axle using the reverse steps and be sure to torque all nuts and bolts to manufacturer specifications. \n\nOnly remove one CV axle at a time, to avoid moving gears around inside the transmission and causing damage to the internals.",

        "title": "How To Maintain Your Auto Chassis",
        "content": "KNOW THE CHASSIS LUBRICATION POINTS\n\nChassis lubrication not only covers the actual lubrication of these components, but also a visual inspection to determine that the lubricant is staying where it should. Here are some common lubrication points on vehicles.\n\nSway bar bushings and end-links\nControl Arm Bushings\nBall Joints (King Pins on older vehicles)\nTie Rod Ends (Inner and Outer)\nDrag Links, Idler Arms, some Pitman Arms\n\nOn vehicles using U-joints in the driveshaft, many of these are greaseable and should be considered when doing chassis lubrication.\n\nHOW TO LUBRICATE CHASSIS PARTS\n\nOnce you have identified all the locations you will need to lubricate, you need to make them accessible. Since the chassis parts are mostly accessible from the underside of the car, that means it will need to be put up on jack stands or hoisted on a lift. If you are working without a full lift, remember to use secure jack stands and braces, not just a hydraulic jack. The weight distribution and secure placement you get with proper stands is a vital safety measure.\nNext up, you\u2019ll need to load your grease gun. Here\u2019s how that works if you\u2019ve never used one before:\n\nHOW TO LOAD A GREASE GUN\n\n1. LOCK YOUR\u00a0GREASE GUN\n\nPull back the plunger on the grease gun and lock it into place. You should feel a click when it locks. If you aren\u2019t sure that it has locked, lower your draw pressure without letting go and see if it tries to retract. If it does, keep pulling. Some grease guns take a little muscle to lock open.\n\n2. OPEN THE BARREL\n\nUnscrew the main barrel that holds the grease. If you started with a loaded gun and you are reloading, remember to clear out the old grease tube.\n\n3. OPEN THE CARTRIDGE\n\nThe new cartridge has a pull tab on one end to open it. That tab goes on the pump head side. The other side has a plastic cap, that goes on the plunger side.\n\n4. LOAD THE GREASE TUBELOAD THE GREASE TUBE\n\nRemove the plastic cap and pull tab, then seat the grease tube in the barrel. If your old tube had any extra left, pack it in to the new one\n\n5. PUT IT BACK TOGETHER\n\nScrew the barrel together, and give the grease gun a few pumps to insure you are getting grease out of the connecting coupler. Some grease guns have a draw handle that must be pulled back when installing a new cartridge, so check the manual for your grease gun to insure you are loading it properly\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to climb under the vehicle and lubricate the points you already identified. Of course, they can look a lot different once you are under the vehicle than they did when you were planning things out. Make sure you have an\u00a0automotive maintenance manual\u00a0on hand or search online for your exact lubrication points. Any serviceable component on the vehicle that can accept grease will have a grease zerk on it. This is a small nipple that accepts the grease guns connector, snapping onto it and allowing for grease to flow from the gun into the component. It\u2019s important to wipe off the zerk from dust and dirt before hooking up.\nOnce you snap onto a zerk, begun pumping the grease gun. Your grease gun lever should pump with minimal resistance and after 2-3 pumps, you should begin to see grease being forced out of the joint or dust boot. Once you see this, you can stop once you see fresh grease being forced out. Use a paper towel to wipe the excess off, and unhook the grease gun connector. Now, you can move on.\n\nRemember, not all of you lubrication points will have\u00a0grease fittings. Many modern day components are built with sealed components, meaning, they are greased at assembly, and sealed. For polyurethane components, like bushings that aren\u2019t greaseable, a sprayable silicone can work, or an all-purpose grease. For metal joints and bushings, that have no zerk, you will need to disassemble the component, apply grease directly to the contact surfaces, and then reinstall it.\n\nINSPECTING THE\u00a0UNDERSIDE OF YOUR VEHICLE\n\nBefore calling the project complete and lowering the car, it\u2019s good practice to inspect the components you just serviced and make sure nothing needs replacement. A common fail-point, for example, are tie rods and steering components that have a dust boot covering the joint. These boots protect the grease, but fail over time by cracking and falling off. Inspect each dust boot carefully, and inspect the bushings you are greasing for cracking as well. Be sure to grab steering components and attempt to move up and down, along with side to side, and twist. You are looking for any major play in the components that could indicate you need replacements.\nRemember, U-joints on rear-wheel drive vehicles require spinning the drive shaft to reach many of the grease zerks, so the vehicle needs to be in neutral. While you are spinning the joints, take the time to see if it has any play sliding fore and aft. If it does, that\u2019s a pretty good sign the u-joints need replacing.\nFor Front-Wheel drive vehicles, CV joints should always be inspected to insure none of the boots are cracked, and are leaking out their vital lubrication grease. If you find a cracked boot quickly, you can often replace / regrease the joint, but if it has been cracked for too long, often replacement is needed.\nTaking the time to lubricate your chassis components is vital to keeping your car driving and steering properly, and avoiding costly replacements. If the job appears too hard, remember to check out one of our Preferred Shops in your area, that can help with not only an oil change, but proper lubrication. If you want to tackle the job yourself, your local AutoZone has all the grease supplies, and advice you\u2019ll need to get the job done.",

If there\u2019s an issue with the inner joint, you\u2019ll experience vibration and noise during straight line acceleration. If you\u2019re experiencing a loud popping or clicking sound when sharply turning, it\u2019s likely an outer joint issue with the CV axle.\nNote: This acceleration issue may also be caused by transmission or motor mounts. Check these if you\u2019re having acceleration problems. If they are the cause, simply replace these mounts to make the repair.\n\n2. Leaking Boot Issues\n\nBoot issues can be identified with a simple visual inspection. During inspection, turn the wheels to all angles and look for cracked or split rubber and/or grease on either the outer or inner boot. A bad boot allows grease to leak out and debris to sneak in, ruining the CV joint bearings.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How Long Do EV Batteries Really Last?",
        "content": "Introduction to EV Batteries\n\nElectric vehicle batteries are responsible for storing and delivering the electric energy that propels EVs. Unlike the lead-acid batteries found in traditional vehicles, EV batteries are typically Lithium-ion (Li-ion) or variations of this technology due to their high energy density and relatively light weight.\nUnderstanding the life expectancy of these high-tech marvels is imperative, as they constitute a significant portion of the vehicle\u2019s overall cost and are not as simple to replace as the 12-volt battery you\u2019re used to. Modern EV batteries use an array of cells connected in series and parallel to achieve the required voltage and capacity. These cells are packed within modules and are then combined to create a battery pack. Managing the delicate balance within these cells is critical to extending the battery\u2019s life.\n\nFactors Influencing Battery Lifespan\n\nEV batteries, despite their advanced abilities, are not immune to the effects of time. Several factors play into how long an EV battery will last before it needs replacing.\n\nTemperature \u2013 Temperature perhaps has the most significant impact. Extremes of hot and cold can both degrade the battery. This is why many electric vehicles come equipped with sophisticated thermal management systems to keep the battery at just the right temperature.\u00a0\nCharging cycles \u2013 The number of charging cycles a battery undergoes takes its toll. Each time a battery goes from a full charge to a full discharge counts as one cycle. However, it\u2019s the high and low states of charge that are particularly stressful for the batteries and can accelerate their wear.\u00a0\nDiagnostic charges \u2013 EVs that sit idle for extended periods can face the issue of deep discharge, a phenomenon that occurs when the battery loses charge over time. This is why many battery management systems will engage in periodic diagnostic charges to ensure a level of charge even while the vehicle is not in use.\n\nGenerally, though, experts believe that an EV battery should last well beyond its minimum warranty timeframe of eight years with 15 years being a reasonable expectation.\n\nSigns of Battery Deterioration\n\nThe good news is that EV batteries typically degrade gradually, showing signs of wear over time. Being able to spot these early can save you from more significant issues down the road.\nOne of the initial telltale signs is a decreased range per charge. This decline points to a lower charge capacity and is potentially a sign that the battery\u2019s cells are starting to fail. Performance can also take a hit as the battery deteriorates. Acceleration may feel less responsive, and the vehicle\u2019s top speed may be lower than you\u2019re used to.\nFortunately, modern electric vehicles come with an array of diagnostic systems that can provide both drivers and technicians with a wealth of data to monitor the health of the battery. You\u2019ll get a message if the battery begins to fail testing. Also, routine maintenance for EVs should include scans that determine the battery\u2019s health.\n\nExtending EV Battery Life\n\nCaring for an EV battery isn\u2019t rocket science, but it does require a degree of mindfulness. Here are some best practices for ensuring your EV battery lasts as long as it should.\n\nAvoid high states of charge wherever possible and do not let the battery sit at a 100% charge for extended periods. Equally, don\u2019t let it drop to extremely low levels if you can avoid doing so. It\u2019s best to keep your battery within the 20 to 80 percent charge range.\u00a0\nPark your electric vehicle in the shade when the temperatures are sweltering, and use a garage or a carport whenever possible to shield the battery from the elements.\n\nThe way you drive can also impact the battery\u2019s longevity. Be mindful of aggressive acceleration and hard braking, as these can put strain on the battery.\n\nReplacing EV Batteries\n\nWhen all else fails, and it\u2019s time to replace the EV battery, what should you expect? The process is not only complex but can be quite costly, depending on the make and model of your vehicle.\u00a0 A battery pack could be $5,000 for select vehicles, or more than $40,000 for long range models for certain carmakers.\nIn some cases, it may be possible to repair a battery rather than replacing it entirely, especially if the issue is with a smaller component of the battery system. When that\u2019s possible, you could be spending several hundred dollars rather than the extreme cost of a replacement pack.\nFactors such as the age and condition of the vehicle, warranty coverage, and the availability of replacement batteries will all influence this decision. Since the cost of a new EV battery can range from several thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, owners should be keep it in mind when they consider cost of ownership. Fortunately, as the technology becomes more widespread, it\u2019s expected that the cost will decrease.\nEV batteries are a marvel of modern engineering, and they are getting better with each new iteration. By understanding how to care for and monitor your battery, you\u2019ll be able to extend its lifespan and get the most out of your electric vehicle.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Does Cold Weather Affect EV Batteries?\u00a0",
        "content": "Introduction to EV Battery Technology\n\nTo understand how cold weather impacts EV batteries, you need to first understand the basics of these power units. EV batteries are, in essence, large-capacity energy storage systems designed to drive electric motors. Lithium-ion batteries, the most common type used in EVs today, consist of cells that store electricity through chemical reactions.\nLike any battery, electrons flow from the positively charged cathode to the negatively charged anode in an EV battery. Then, when the battery is being charged, the electron flow is reversed. Unlike other smaller batteries, the EV battery pack is a series of battery modules containing dozens or hundreds of smaller battery cells, and each of them function in the same way.\n\nThe Influence of Temperature on Battery Performance\n\nTemperature plays a vital role in the performance of lithium-ion batteries, to be certain. These batteries operate best within a set temperature range, and the ideal temperature for performance is between 68 and 110 F. Chemical reactions within the batteries are temperature-dependent, and when temperatures drop, these reactions slow down, resulting in diminished energy storage and discharge capacity.\nWhat that means is that the battery\u2019s kinetic energy is slower than the ideal range, and it won\u2019t perform as well when it\u2019s cold.\n\nCold Weather Challenges for EV Batteries\n\nFrigid temperatures pose specific challenges for EV owners. The most noticeable is the reduced range. The battery\u2019s ability to hold and discharge energy efficiently drops, meaning that you might not get as many miles out of a single charge as you would during warmer months.\nYou might notice:\n\nThe car\u2019s acceleration is slower than you\u2019re used to in warm weather.\nThe battery range is significantly less \u2013 as much as 40 percent lower during winter driving than in summer.\nThe battery depletes when it\u2019s idle as it uses energy to keep itself warm.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only impact that temperature has on EV batteries. With cold temperatures, the interior climate control activates and electrically-operated heat pump or an electric heater \u2013 or both. The energy used to keep the cabin warm also takes away from the operating range. The warmer you make the interior, the shorter your range tends to be.\nAdditionally, charging times can increase, and regenerative braking systems\u2014which help recharge the battery\u2014may become less effective. These drawbacks can lead to anxiety over being stranded without a charge or the inconvenience of longer charging periods.\n\nTips for Cold Weather Battery Maintenance\n\nDespite the challenges, there are several strategies EV owners can take to counteract the effects of cold weather on their vehicles:\n\nPreconditioning the car while still connected to the charger can warm up the battery before use, helping to preserve its range.\nKeeping EVs garaged and insulated from the harsh weather conditions outside helps maintain a more consistent temperature.\nIt\u2019s also beneficial to limit the use of high-drain accessories while driving and to adhere to a sensible charge range of 20 to 80 percent to avoid undue stress on the battery.\n\nAnother great way to make your car\u2019s battery range last is to modify your driving habits for the winter. Accelerate in a controlled and conservative manner to reduce the high-drain scenarios. And when possible, adjust your regenerative braking to recoup as much energy as possible during stops. That way, you\u2019ll retain the most range possible for your car and, as a side benefit, your brake pads wear less.\n\nInnovations and Future Developments\n\nFortunately, the future looks promising for EV operation in colder climates. Battery heating systems are becoming more sophisticated, working to keep the battery in its optimal temperature range. Also, ongoing research is dedicated to developing batteries with better cold-weather performance, focusing on new types of electrolytes and anode and cathode materials that are less affected by low temperatures. Developments in solid state batteries, for example, could make cold weather changes less of a concern.\nManufacturers and researchers continue to focus on making EVs as reliable in the winter as they are during the summer, ensuring that EV owners can drive with confidence, no matter the weather. These advancements stand to expand the appeal and viability of electric cars in regions with harsh winter climates.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How Much Does a New Car Key Cost?",
        "content": "Understanding Car Key Types\n\nWhen it comes to car keys, one size does not fit all. Different vehicles come with different key systems, each with its own set of features. Here are some common types of car keys and their characteristics:\n\nTraditional keys \u2013 These are the standard vehicle keys drivers have been using for years. They consist of a physical metal key shaft that\u2019s inserted into the ignition cylinder and turned to start the car. Replacement costs for traditional keys are generally low due to their simple design and lack of tech.\nTransponder keys \u2013 Equipped with a small electronic chip, transponder keys add an extra layer of security. The chip communicates with the car\u2019s immobilizer, ensuring that only a key with the correct code or programming can start the engine. While it\u2019s more secure, the technology involved can make transponder key replacement a bit more expensive.\nSmart keys/integrated fobs \u2013 These advanced keys don\u2019t need to be physically inserted into the ignition. Smart keys use radio frequency signals to communicate with the car, allowing for keyless entry and ignition, and you can keep the key in a pocket or bag. The convenience they offer comes with a higher replacement cost due to the integrated technology.\n\nFactors Influencing Car Key Costs\n\nUnderstanding why car key replacements can vary in cost is essential. Two significant factors play a role in determining the price:\n\nTechnology \u2013 As mentioned earlier, the level of technology in the key greatly influences its cost. Smart keys and transponder keys, which involve intricate electronic components in the key as well as tech in the vehicle to recognize them, tend to be more expensive than traditional keys.\nMaterials \u2013 The materials used to manufacture the key also impact its cost. Keys made from higher-quality materials may be more durable but can come with a higher price tag. The type of metal, plastic, or electronic components used contributes to the overall cost of producing the key.\nBlank vs complete key \u2013 If you\u2019re looking to replace a damaged key shaft on a key with an integrated fob, it\u2019s substantially less to replace the key and case rather than the whole thing.\n\nAnd finally, the cost is often influenced by the brand it is for. Keys for premium or luxury brands typically cost more.\n\nAverage Cost Estimates\n\nWhile specific costs can vary based on factors like the make and model of your vehicle, here are general price ranges for common car key replacements:\n\nTraditional keys \u2013 Replacement costs typically range from $25 to $100. There\u2019s no programming involved, although you may need to have AutoZone, a locksmith, or dealership cut the key for you.\nTransponder keys \u2013 Expect to pay anywhere from $100 to $250 for a transponder key replacement. The immobilizer chip in the key will also need to be programmed.\nSmart keys \u2013 Replacement costs for smart keys can range from $200 to $500 or more. The advanced technology and keyless features contribute to the higher price.\n\nAdditional Fees to Consider\n\nWhen budgeting for a new car key, it\u2019s crucial to be aware of potential additional fees:\n\nProgramming costs \u2013 For keys with either an immobilizer chip, a key fob, or both, programming is necessary to sync the key with your vehicle. This process often requires specialized equipment and may incur an additional fee. Some places can charge upwards of $150.\nLocksmith services \u2013 If you\u2019re unable to visit an AutoZone store and need a locksmith to assist with key replacement, their services may come with additional charges.\nTowing costs \u2013 If your car is not drivable because you\u2019ve lost the key, towing it to a service center may be necessary, incurring additional expenses. Tow charges tend to start at around $50 and go up quickly, especially when you need to be towed quite a distance.\n\nIf you need a replacement key, visit your local AutoZone where our friendly staff can guide you through the available options. Don\u2019t let a lost key leave you stranded \u2013 AutoZone has you covered.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What is Limp Mode?",
        "content": "Common Symptoms of Limp Mode\n\nLimp mode, also known as \u201climp home mode,\u201d is a protective mechanism that activates when your vehicle\u2019s computer detects a potential issue that could lead to severe damage. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the common symptoms that might indicate your vehicle has entered limp mode:\n\nReduced Power. One of the primary indicators of limp mode is a sudden loss of power or acceleration.\nLimited RPM. If you notice that your vehicle\u2019s engine is reluctant to rev beyond a certain RPM range, it could be a sign of limp mode.\nStuck in a Single Gear. Limp mode often results in your vehicle being stuck in one specific gear, usually second or third, regardless of your speed.\nWarning Lights. Limp mode is usually accompanied by the illumination of various warning lights on your dashboard, such as the check engine light or transmission warning light.\nSudden Drop in Performance. You might experience sluggish or unresponsive performance, making it difficult to reach higher speeds or climb inclines.\nAltered Shifting. If your vehicle\u2019s transmission shifts abruptly or more slowly than usual, it could be indicative of limp mode.\nSafe Mode Message. Some vehicles might display a message on the instrument cluster indicating that the vehicle is in \u201csafe mode\u201d or \u201climp mode.\u201d\nLimited Top Speed. Even with the accelerator fully pressed, your vehicle might struggle to achieve its usual top speed.\nIncreased Fuel Consumption. Limp mode can cause your vehicle to burn more fuel than usual due to the compromised efficiency.\nUnusual Noises or Vibrations. In some cases, limp mode can trigger unusual noises or vibrations as the vehicle struggles to perform normally.\n\nCauses of Limp Mode Activation\n\nLimp mode activates when the onboard computer detects anomalies that could potentially harm your engine or transmission. While it\u2019s a protective feature, understanding the triggers that can lead to limp mode activation can help you take proactive measures to prevent such situations. Here are some common causes that might put your vehicle into limp mode:\n\nTransmission Issues. Problems within the transmission system, such as overheating, low fluid levels, or faulty sensors, can prompt limp mode activation.\nEngine Malfunctions. Issues like a misfiring cylinder, overheating engine, or a malfunctioning throttle position sensor can trigger limp mode.\nSensor Failures. Modern vehicles rely heavily on sensors to monitor various parameters. When sensors related to the engine, transmission, or emissions system fail, it can lead to limp mode activation. Speed sensors are a leading cause.\nElectrical Glitches. Electrical problems, such as a damaged wiring harness or a control module issue, can confuse the vehicle\u2019s computer system and initiate limp mode.\nFuel System Problems. If there\u2019s a fuel delivery issue, like a clogged fuel filter or a failing fuel pump, the engine might not receive the proper fuel-air mixture, leading to limp mode.\nExcessive Heat. Engine or transmission overheating due to coolant leaks, a faulty thermostat, or a malfunctioning radiator fan can trigger limp mode.\nTurbocharger or Supercharger Issues. Vehicles equipped with forced induction systems might experience limp mode if there are problems with the turbocharger or supercharger.\nEmission System Faults. Malfunctions within the emissions control system, such as a failing catalytic converter or oxygen sensor, can trigger limp mode to prevent further damage.\nFaulty Braking System. Some vehicles might enter limp mode if there\u2019s a problem with the anti-lock braking system (ABS) or electronic stability control (ESC) system.\n\nDiagnosing Limp Mode\n\nDiagnosing limp mode requires a systematic approach to identify the underlying issue that triggered the activation. Here\u2019s a general process that mechanics often follow to diagnose limp mode:\n\nScan for Trouble Codes. Use an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner to retrieve any stored trouble codes from the vehicle\u2019s computer. These codes can give you a starting point by indicating which system or sensor triggered the limp mode.\nInspect Sensors. Focus on the sensors related to the systems indicated by the trouble codes like the throttle position sensor, oxygen sensors, mass airflow sensor, and other critical sensors. Check for damaged wires, loose connections, or sensor malfunctions that could lead to inaccurate readings.\nCheck Fluid Levels. Ensure that essential fluids, such as transmission fluid, engine oil, and coolant, are at the appropriate levels. Low fluid levels or fluid contamination can cause issues that trigger limp mode.\nInspect Wiring and Connections. Thoroughly inspect the wiring harnesses and connectors associated with the systems implicated in the limp mode activation. Damaged or corroded connections can disrupt signals between components.\nCheck for Mechanical Issues. Examine mechanical components like the transmission, engine, turbocharger, and exhaust system for any signs of wear, damage, or leaks that could lead to performance problems.\nExamine Exhaust Emissions. If limp mode is related to emissions control, check the catalytic converter, EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) valve, and other components for proper function.\nPerform Test Drives. After addressing potential causes, perform test drives to see if the issue has been resolved and if the vehicle operates normally without triggering limp mode.\nClear Trouble Codes. Once repairs are made, use the OBD-II scanner to clear any stored trouble codes. This step ensures that the vehicle\u2019s computer recognizes that the issue has been addressed.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that diagnosing limp mode can sometimes be complex, especially if multiple systems are involved. If you\u2019re not experienced in automotive diagnostics, it\u2019s recommended to seek the assistance of a qualified mechanic or technician who has the knowledge, tools, and expertise to accurately diagnose and resolve the issue causing limp mode activation.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring Limp Mode\n\nIf limp mode occurs, it can be hard to ignore at the moment since it\u2019s restricting or debilitating for your drive. But restarting the car can often get it out of limp mode temporarily, although, that\u2019s not always a good idea. If you ignore limp mode, it can result in more than just continued poor performance. It could cause further damage to the original fault, higher repair costs, and put you in a position where you\u2019re stranded, need a tow, or get into an unsafe driving situation.\nAlways deal with concerns like limp mode right away \u2013 if for nothing else, for your peace of mind.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "When to Replace a Brake Light Switch",
        "content": "Understanding the Brake Light Switch\u2019s Role\n\nBefore delving into when to replace a brake light switch, let\u2019s first understand its role. The brake light switch is located near the brake pedal assembly, and its primary function is to activate your vehicle\u2019s brake lights when you apply pressure to the brake pedal. This simple yet critical action serves two primary purposes.\n\nVisibility. When you press the brake pedal, the brake lights instantly illuminate at the rear of your vehicle. This alerts drivers behind you that you\u2019re slowing down or coming to a stop, helping prevent rear-end collisions, especially in low-light conditions or inclement weather.\nSafety. Your brake lights also inform drivers and pedestrians of your intentions on the road, contributing to smoother traffic flow and reducing the risk of accidents.\n\nBut it also serves as a signal for your vehicle\u2019s onboard computer. If you have your cruise control set, pressing the brake pedal sends a signal to the computer to cancel the set speed, letting your car decelerate.\nSigns of a Failing Brake Light Switch\n\nA malfunctioning brake light switch can compromise your safety and potentially lead to accidents. Fortunately, there are telltale signs that can alert you to the need for a brake light switch replacement.\n\nBrake lights stay on. If your brake lights remain illuminated even when you\u2019re not pressing the brake pedal, it\u2019s a clear sign of a failing brake light switch. This not only poses a risk to your safety but also drains your vehicle\u2019s battery.\nBrake lights don\u2019t illuminate. On the flip side, if your brake lights don\u2019t come on when you press the brake pedal, it\u2019s another indicator of a malfunctioning switch. This can lead to rear-end collisions since drivers won\u2019t be aware you\u2019re stopping.\nInconsistent brake light operation. Sometimes, a faulty switch may cause your brake lights to work intermittently. This inconsistency can confuse drivers behind you and make your intentions unclear.\nCruise control issues. If your cruise control behaves erratically or fails to disengage, it could be linked to a failing switch.\n\nNow that you know what to look for, let\u2019s move on to diagnosing a faulty brake light switch.\nDiagnosing a Faulty Brake Light Switch\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed any of the signs mentioned above, it\u2019s essential to confirm whether your brake light switch is indeed the culprit.\u00a0\nBegin with a visual inspection. Start by locating the brake light switch, typically positioned near the brake pedal assembly. Inspect the switch for visible damage or loose connections. Tighten any loose connections and replace the switch if it appears damaged. \nUsing a multimeter set to continuity mode, disconnect the electrical connector from the brake light switch. Then, press the brake pedal while testing the switch\u2019s terminals for continuity. If there\u2019s no continuity when the brake pedal is depressed, it\u2019s a clear indication that the switch is faulty and needs replacing.\nPotential Consequences of Ignoring the Brake Light Switch Issue\nNeglecting a failing brake light switch can have severe consequences beyond the inconvenience of a non-functional brake light system. Your brake lights are a critical safety feature that alerts others to your braking actions. Ignoring a malfunctioning switch increases the risk of rear-end collisions and other accidents.\nAlso, operating a vehicle with malfunctioning brake lights is often against the law and can result in traffic citations or fines. Additionally, insurance claims may be affected if an accident occurs due to this negligence.\nIf your brake lights stay on continuously due to a faulty switch, it can drain your vehicle\u2019s battery, leaving you stranded and requiring a jump-start.\nSteps for Troubleshooting and Resolving Brake Light Switch Problems\nIf you\u2019ve determined that your brake light switch is faulty, don\u2019t put it off. Follow these steps to troubleshoot and replace the brake light switch.\n\nGather tools and materials. You\u2019ll need a replacement brake light switch, a wrench or socket set, a multimeter, and a screwdriver.\nMake it safe. Ensure your vehicle is parked on a level surface with the engine turned off. Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery to prevent electrical accidents.\nLocate and remove the old switch. Find the brake light switch near the brake pedal assembly. Use your wrench or socket set to remove the mounting bolts or clips holding the switch in place. Disconnect the electrical connector.\nInstall the new switch. Connect the electrical connector to the new brake light switch and secure it in place using the mounting bolts or clips.\nTest the new switch. Reconnect the negative battery terminal and test the new switch by pressing the brake pedal to ensure the brake lights illuminate correctly.\nAdjust if necessary. If your vehicle allows for adjustment, ensure the switch is correctly positioned to activate the brake lights when the pedal is pressed.\nReassemble and test. Reassemble any components you removed during the process and test your brake lights again to confirm they are functioning correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can replace a faulty brake light switch and restore your vehicle\u2019s brake light system.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Car's Radio Not Working",
        "content": "Common Causes of a Car\u2019s Radio Not Working\n\nThe causes can vary greatly, but one thing that they all have in common is that they\u2019re electrical faults. Causes include:\n\nBlown fuse. The most common cause of a car radio not working could be as simple as a blown fuse. This happens when the electrical circuit overloads, causing the protective fuse to blow and cut off the power supply to the radio.\nWiring issues. If the wiring connections to your car radio are loose or damaged, it can result in your radio not functioning properly.\nDead battery. If your car\u2019s battery is dead or weak, it may not provide enough power for the radio to operate.\nFaulty head unit. Sometimes, the problem lies within the radio unit itself, which could require repair or replacement.\nAntenna problems. If your car\u2019s antenna is broken, disconnected, or not properly installed, it can affect radio signal reception.\nOutdated software Just like computers and smartphones, modern car radios also require software updates. Failure to update the radio software can lead to compatibility issues.\nIgnition switch problems. The ignition switch can sometimes cause a radio to stop working if it\u2019s faulty, preventing any systems on the same circuit from working.\nCorroded ground wire. The ground wire, which completes the electrical circuit for the radio, can become corroded over time, disrupting the circuit.\nAmplifier issue. If your car has an amplifier and it\u2019s not working correctly, it can disrupt the radio operation.\n\nEssentially, any electrical system surrounding the radio that isn\u2019t working normally could be the reason you aren\u2019t getting audio output.\n\nTroubleshooting Steps to Fix a Car\u2019s Radio\n\nTo narrow down where the fault lies and potentially correct the problem with your radio quickly, go through the following steps to troubleshoot the system.\u00a0\n\nCheck the fuse. It\u2019s the simplest solution and the most common. But if a burnt fuse that\u2019s replaced corrects the issue and it happens again, there\u2019s a concern that needs to be addressed.\nIs your radio lighting up when you turn the key and start the engine? If the display illuminates, whether it\u2019s the time, an audio source, or backlighting, the radio is getting power, so you can eliminate power delivery concerns.\nDoes the radio come on and cut out, or is it not coming on at all? A blown fuse or bad wiring could be the problem if the radio doesn\u2019t power up at all, but if the condition is intermittent, it won\u2019t be a fuse. It could be a loose connection still.\nIs the radio control responsive? If it\u2019s frozen, there could be an internal fault or it might need an update from the manufacturer. If it appears to be working but there\u2019s no audio output, the amplifier may be bad. Or, there could still be a bad electrical connection.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re able to hear audio but the AM/FM radio isn\u2019t clear or is only static, check the antenna connection.\n\nIn many cases, a radio can be removed and sent to a repair shop for bench testing if you suspect that the problem is within the unit.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nRadio issues can be difficult to trace if they aren\u2019t as simple as a fuse or a disconnected harness. A wire rubbed through, a pushed-out pin in a connector, or a bad ground wire can cause intermittent symptoms. If you\u2019re struggling to figure out why your radio stopped working in your car, the best use of your time might be to take it to a professional technician. Seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nAs well, any systems that integrate with systems like airbags should be handled with care. A mistake in diagnosis or repair could cause a fault that opens a whole new nest of issues. If you\u2019re not confident dealing with electrical repairs, save yourself some time and frustration and get a pro to look at it.\n\nMaintenance Tips to Prevent Radio Malfunctions\n\nPower surges are a common cause for many radio malfunctions, so one of the best tips to prevent an issue is to turn the radio off when you\u2019re charging the battery or boosting it to start the car. If your battery is getting low on charge, put it on a trickle charge to restore its capacity slowly.\nAnother idea is to check every few months if there\u2019s an over-the-air (OTA) update for your radio, much like keeping your home computer\u2019s software current. Otherwise, clean your radio from time to time with a microfiber cloth to get rid of dust buildup.",

        "title": "Electrical Issues After Replacing Car Battery",
        "content": "Common Electrical Problems and Causes\n\nThere can be many problems that occur after replacing a car battery:\n\nThe car may not start. This can happen for many reasons. The new battery might not be charged, or the battery terminals might be loose or have corrosion preventing the flow of electrical current.\nThere could be burning smells. Usually accompanied by a massive spark after connecting the terminals backward, reversed polarity can be responsible for blowing fuses, damaging the alternator, causing burnt wiring, and more.\nThe Check Engine Light comes on. After not being energized for a while, the car\u2019s computers might trigger a malfunction indicator.\nElectronics operate erratically. Some components might lose their memory or have settings reset after the old battery has been disconnected.\nThe alarm might go off. In some vehicles, disconnecting and reconnecting the battery can trigger the alarm system, requiring a reset.\nThe battery might drain quickly. If there\u2019s a significant draw on the battery, even a new battery might draw down quickly when it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nFor newer cars, one of the major factors is that the battery hasn\u2019t been registered. This process lets the car know that there\u2019s a new battery installed since it\u2019s compensated for an aging or failing battery for months, likely. If a battery isn\u2019t registered, it can cause warnings, no-starts, or erratic behavior.\n\nTroubleshooting Steps for Electrical Issues\n\nEach of these common problems can be checked to determine if it\u2019s the cause of your issue, or at least to rule it out.\n\nCheck that your battery has sufficient voltage. A battery test with a multimeter should show around 12.6 volts for a fully charged battery. And verify that your terminals are clean and tight.\nInspect the fuses and relays. You\u2019ll also need to check if your positive cable is connected to the positive terminal, and the same for the negative. If you\u2019ve reversed the polarity accidentally, there will certainly be something burnt or damaged, and you\u2019ll almost always have some sort of significant repair necessary, from a bad alternator or blown onboard computer to burnt wiring and connectors.\nUse a scan tool to check and clear codes. When the Check Engine Light comes on, you can use an OBD-II scan tool to check which codes are present. If the light has only come on since the battery was installed, clear the codes and keep driving, keeping an eye out to see if the light returns.\nPress the unlock or disarm button on the alarm. If the siren is going off or the horn honking, often all you need to do is press the button to make it stop. If you don\u2019t have a remote, turn the ignition key in the driver\u2019s door lock, and that sometimes disarms it too.\nTest for a draw after the car\u2019s electronics have gone to sleep. There should be less than 100 mA present.\n\nFor newer cars, find out if the battery needs to be registered to your car. Battery registration is most common for vehicles that require EFB and AGM batteries, but not always. It might be a process you can do yourself, but there are cases where only a dealer\u2019s software can do it.\n\nSafety Precautions for Car Battery Replacement\n\nIf you\u2019re replacing a car battery, one of the best ideas is to use a memory saver. This small but convenient tool plugs into your lighter socket or OBD port and keeps the car minimally energized to prevent losing your settings.\nOther precautions to take when you replace a car battery include:\n\nAlways make sure you\u2019re connecting the right cable to the right terminal \u2013 positive to positive and negative to negative.\nOnly install a battery with a group size intended for your car\u2019s build.\nHave your keys close by when you connect the new battery in case you need to disarm the alarm.\u00a0\nAlways install the battery hold-down.\n\nSeeking Professional Help\n\nIf something is wrong and you don\u2019t know what to do after replacing your car battery, follow the troubleshooting above. If you\u2019re unable to determine the problem, it\u2019s time to get a professional involved, whether for advice or for a diagnosis. Seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job. The battery is a crucial component, and if it\u2019s not working correctly, you could be left stranded, and that\u2019s never worth it.",

        "title": "Window Regulator Vs. Motor: What\u2019s the Difference?",
        "content": "Window Regulator: Function and Operation\n\nA window regulator is a mechanical assembly responsible for moving your car\u2019s windows up and down. When you press the button to roll the window up or down, it sends a signal to the window lift motor, which then activates the window regulator. The regulator, which is fitted within the door panel of your car, uses a series of gears and mechanical linkages to convert the rotational motion of the motor into the vertical movement of the window.\nThere are two types of window regulators: manual and power. Manual window regulators are operated by a hand crank, while power regulators are activated by an electric motor \u2013 the type most commonly found in modern vehicles. Within those two categories are a few commonly-used designs including:\n\nScissor-type regulators that use a mechanism similar to a pair of scissors. A single arm extends and contracts to move the window up and down.\nCable-type regulators where a drum is wound with cable that moves the window. When the motor turns, it winds or unwinds the cable, raising or lowering the window.\nBowden system regulators that have a flexible cable that runs within a hollow housing, and the movement of the cable controls the window\u2019s motion.\n\nWindow Motor: Function and Operation\n\nThe power window motor in your car is responsible for the automatic movement of your windows. When you press the window button, it sends a 12-volt current to this motor to move it one way, and the polarity is reversed to move it the other direction. The motor converts this electrical signal into mechanical energy, which drives a series of gears connected to the window regulator. This action causes the window to move up or down.\n\nDifferences between Window Regulator and Motor\n\n\u00a0The regulator and motor often get confused, but there are some rather distinct differences to help keep them straight.\n\nA window regulator helps \u2018regulate\u2019 or control the direction of the window glass, whereas the window motor serves to propel it in the direction the regulator holds it.\nA window regulator doesn\u2019t require any electrical current to operate, and even non-powered windows use regulators. You\u2019ll only find a window motor on electric power windows, and they\u2019re fed with 12-volt power.\nThe window regulator contains all of the parts that physically move up and down. The window motor stays in a fixed position within the door.\n\nCommon Issues with Window Regulators and Motors\n\nWindow regulators and window motors are essential parts of your vehicle\u2019s power window system. However, like any other component, they can encounter issues, affecting their functionality. Here are some common problems you might face:\n\nPressing multiple times to roll the window. If you have to press the window button several times to roll the window up or down, it could be a sign of a failing window motor or regulator.\nFast or slow windows speed. If your window moves slower or faster than usual, this could also indicate a problem with the motor or regulator.\nClicking sounds. Hearing clicking sounds from the door, when you try to move the window, could mean there\u2019s an issue with the window motor or a binding regulator.\nScreeching, scratching, or clunking noises. Strange noises while operating the window indicate a malfunction.\nWindow jamming or falling down. A broken window regulator cable can cause the window to jam or even fall down inside the door.\nWindow won\u2019t stay rolled up. If your window doesn\u2019t stay rolled up, this could be a symptom of a bad window regulator.\nWindow off its track. If the window is off its track and doesn\u2019t move smoothly, this could be due to a faulty regulator.\nThe window rolls back down slightly after it travels. If the window goes back down after travelling all the way to the top, it could mean a limiter issue in the window motor.\n\nChoosing between Window Regulator and Motor Replacement\n\nHow do you troubleshoot a window regulator or a window motor? In most cases, it comes down to pinpointing the most likely cause based on the symptoms presented. These tips can help you determine if it\u2019s a motor or regulator you need.\n\nListen for noises. When you press the window button, listen for any unusual sounds. A humming or grinding noise could indicate a motor problem, while a clicking sound might point to a regulator issue.\nTest all the windows. If only one window is having trouble, it\u2019s likely an issue with that specific window\u2019s motor or regulator. If all windows aren\u2019t working, the problem could be more systemic, such as a blown fuse or a problem with the master switch.\nCheck window speed. If your window moves slower or faster than usual, it could indicate a problem with the motor.\nTry moving the window manually. With the car turned off, try to move the window up or down by hand. If it moves easily, this could indicate a problem with the regulator.\nInspect for physical damage. Remove the door panel and visually inspect the regulator and motor for any obvious signs of damage or wear.\nCheck the fuses. If the window doesn\u2019t move at all, check the fuse for the power window system. A blown fuse could be the culprit.\nTest the switches. If the driver\u2019s control works, but the individual door controls don\u2019t, the problem could be with the switches on those doors.",

        "title": "Portable Generator Cost: What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Types of Portable Generators\n\nFuel type is one of the main differentiators for portable generators. The most common conventional options are powered by gasoline, and it probably accounts for about 90% of the market. Other options for conventional portable generators are diesel-powered, natural gas, and propane, and select options are dual-fuel, meaning they can operate on both gasoline and propane or natural gas.\nThe other fuel type that\u2019s gaining popularity is a solar generator. Essentially a battery pack with an inverter, it can be recharged with a household plug or using solar panels that act as its fuel source.\nAnd among all of the portable generator fuel options, there devices can be broken down into two categories: conventional and inverter generators. Conventional generators have a compact engine mounted in an open frame, and they provide excellent electrical current volumes for their size for general use. Inverter generators are more compact and quieter, and they\u2019re designed for a more consistent, regulated current that\u2019s safer for sensitive electronics.\n\nFactors Affecting Portable Generator Cost\n\nHow much does a portable generator cost? It\u2019s not such a clear-cut answer. There are several factors that can affect the price of a generator such as:\n\nPower output \u2013 This is probably the most significant factor in determining the cost. The higher the power output, measured in watts, the more expensive the generator is likely to be.\nBrand \u2013 Some brands are known for their quality and reliability, and as a result, their products tend to be priced higher.\nFuel type \u2013 Portable generators can run on different types of fuels like gasoline, diesel, propane, or natural gas, not to mention solar. The cost can vary depending on the type of fuel the generator uses with solar being among the highest priced.\nFeatures \u2013 Additional features such as electric start, remote control, multiple outlets, and advanced safety features can also add to the cost.\nNoise level \u2013 Generators that operate more quietly often cost more than their noisier counterparts.\nPortability features \u2013 Features that make it more portable such as being lightweight or having wheels and handles can also increase the price.\nCertifications \u2013 Generators that are CARB compliant or have environmental and safety certifications often come at a higher price point.\n\nRemember, the most expensive generator isn\u2019t always the best one for your needs. It\u2019s important to consider what you\u2019ll be using it for and choose a model that offers the best value for your specific requirements.\n\nBudget-Friendly Portable Generators\n\nWith the entry-level-priced generators, you\u2019re going to get something that\u2019s gas-powered in the conventional generator realm with around 4,000 watts or less. Or, if you don\u2019t need a massive amount of power, a portable power station/solar generator with few hundred watts of output could be in the ballpark too.\nThe advantages of a budget-friendly option often include:\n\nThe motor and fuel tank are smaller so it weighs less.\nIt has a smaller footprint, taking up less space.\nIt\u2019s more portable.\u00a0\nThere\u2019s less barrier to purchase.\n\nBut there can be a downside too:\n\nOften, entry-level pricing can indicate a less proven brand, so longevity can be in question.\nThere are a limited number of applications since it has less power.\nThe types and number of outputs are limited.\n\nHigh-End Portable Generators\nWhen you\u2019re spending more for a portable generator, it opens up a realm of options and features, particularly more energy capability. It\u2019s not uncommon for a gas-powered generator to produce 6,000 watts or more, and some are rated for a peak output of over 9,000 watts. Solar generators are more prevalent in this space too.\nAdvantages are:\n\nLarger fuel tanks for longer runtimes.\nDual-fuel options are often available.\nThere are often 120-volt and 240-volt outputs.\nYou can find inverter generators capable of operating sensitive electronics.\nDigital displays are more commonplace.\nOptions tend to be smaller for the same power output.\n\nBut it\u2019s not for everyone. Disadvantages include:\n\nThe obvious higher cost to purchase.\nSome of the conventional generators become extremely heavy, contradicting portability.\nThey can become more complicated to operate.\n\nLong-Term Cost Considerations\n\nYour initial portable generator cost is one thing, but there are some other factors to keep in mind after the purchase. Maintenance for a portable generator isn\u2019t much, but it adds up over the years. Spark plugs, air filters, and oil need to be changed periodically, whether by time or by hours of runtime. And if the generator is for backup power alone, the fuel will need to be drained and refilled if it doesn\u2019t get used.\nThe amount of fuel you consume over the years of ownership should factor in also. If you plan on using it extensively, then a solar generator might be worthwhile since it costs less to recharge, even if you use a household plug to recharge it. And, it operates virtually silently.",

        "title": "How to Use a Portable Generator",
        "content": "Introduction to Portable Generators\n\nSimply put, portable generators are compact, lightweight, and easy-to-use sources of power that you can take with you wherever you go. They\u2019re perfect for camping trips, outdoor events, or even just to keep on hand in case of an emergency. With a portable generator, you\u2019ll never have to worry about being left in the dark when the power goes out.\nFor the conventional generator, a small engine burns fuel and converts the chemical energy into mechanical energy. Then, an alternator \u2013 also aptly known as a generator \u2013 creates an electromagnetic field from the mechanical rotation of the engine, which is what generates the electric current. The voltage is regulated so it can be safely used by appliances and devices that are plugged into the energized outlets.\n\nTypes of Portable Generators\n\nWhile there are fully electric or solar powered generators that are substantial battery banks, your run-of-the-mill portable generator that\u2019s powered by gas or propane is broken down into two main categories:\n\nInverter generators are quiet, compact, and fuel-sipping generators that are best for situations where you need to power sensitive devices or appliances. These are the more advanced types of generators.\nConventional generators are larger and commonly contained within a tubular frame. They\u2019re the most often-used type, and they\u2019re great at generating power that can energize power-hungry items.\n\nEither way, they\u2019re very similar to operate.\n\nSafety Precautions and Guidelines\nPortable generators are incredibly useful, but they can also be dangerous if not used correctly. To ensure your safety and the safety of those around you, follow these essential guidelines when operating a portable generator:\n\nRead the Manual before using your generator.\nOperate outdoors and 20 feet away from buildings and entrances in a well-ventilated area, away from windows, doors, and vents. Generators produce carbon monoxide (CO), a deadly, odorless gas that can lead to CO poisoning is used in enclosed spaces. Use CO detectors to ensure the space remains safe.\nGround your generator. Some generators need to be grounded to prevent electrical shocks. Consult your owner\u2019s manual for proper grounding procedures.\nAvoid overloading. Do not exceed the generator\u2019s maximum power output. Overloading can damage your appliances and the generator itself. Calculate the total wattage of the devices you plan to power and make sure it\u2019s within the generator\u2019s capacity.\nUse heavy-duty, outdoor-rated extension cords that are in good condition. Make sure the cords have the appropriate wire gauge to handle the electrical load.\nTurn off the generator and let it cool down before refueling, as gasoline can ignite when exposed to hot engine parts.\nKeep the generator dry and don\u2019t use it in wet conditions. Operating a generator in the rain or near water can lead to electrocution.\n\nSetting Up a Portable Generator\n\nWhen you\u2019re getting ready to use your generator, begin by placing it on a flat surface at least 20 feet away from windows and doors. Before starting it, make sure the oil and fuel levels are good, or top them up with the correct fluids for the generator. If your instruction manual says to ground the generator, follow the steps it lays out to do that.\n\nPowering Appliances and Devices\n\nWith outlets on the front panel, it would be easy to just plug in your devices or appliances without a second thought. But if it\u2019s done incorrectly, it can damage the generator or your devices from a power surge.\nConnect your devices before starting your portable generator, using approved outdoor extension cords. Or if it\u2019s for your home\u2019s backup power, connect to your transfer switch before firing it up.\nThen, start the generator. For one with a pull-cord, turn the fuel valve on, set the choke to the \u2018closed\u2019 position, and turn the engine switch to the \u2018on\u2019 position. Pull the recoil cord quickly and firmly to start the engine \u2013 it sometimes requires a handful of pulls. Then, when it starts, turn the choke to the \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018run\u2019 position.\nFor electric-start generators, follow the same process to get it ready, except instead of pulling the cord, press the start button or turn the key. When it starts, turn the choke to the \u2018run\u2019 position.\n\nMaintenance and Troubleshooting\n\nOnce you know how to use a portable generator and get comfortable, you\u2019re almost set. There are a few things you need to do to maintain it too. An oil change should be done first after the initial few hours of use, then at whatever interval the owner\u2019s manual prescribes. The air filter and spark plugs should be inspected annually and replaced as necessary, and the fuel system should be treated with stabilizer if it\u2019s being stored a long time. It\u2019s always a good idea to test the generator at least once per year, ideally once a season.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nGenerator won\u2019t start \u2013 Check the fuel level, oil level, and make sure the fuel valve is open. Inspect the spark plug, air filter, and ensure the choke is set correctly. If the generator has a battery, ensure it\u2019s charged and connected properly.\nLow power output \u2013 Overloading the generator can cause low power output. Make sure you\u2019re not exceeding the generator\u2019s capacity. Check the air filter, fuel system, and spark plug for any issues that may affect engine performance.\nOverheating \u2013 Ensure proper ventilation around the generator and clean any debris from the engine and alternator. Inspect the cooling system, if applicable, and check the oil level.\nErratic voltage output \u2013 Check the voltage regulator for proper operation and inspect the alternator for any signs of damage or wear.\nExcessive noise or vibration \u2013 Inspect the generator for loose or damaged components. Make sure it\u2019s placed on a stable, level surface. Check the engine mounts and exhaust system for issues.\nLeaks \u2013 Regularly check for fuel or oil leaks. Tighten or replace any damaged hoses, gaskets, or seals as needed.\n\nPractical Applications of Portable Generators\n\nOnce you have a portable generator, you might be surprised at how useful it is. You\u2019ll be putting it to use frequently, and some potential applications include:\n\nEmergency power backup\nCamping and other outdoor activities\nConstruction sites\nEvents like weddings and parties\nFor a food truck or mobile business\nRemote locations like ranches or cabins\nTailgating at sporting events",

        "title": "How to Program a Keyless Entry Remote",
        "content": "Understanding Keyless Entry Remotes\n\nKeyless entry remotes add to the convenience of operating your vehicle. They work with a combination of radio frequency and digital encryption, and they most commonly operate on the 315 MHz and 433 MHz spectrums.\nEach key fob has a unique identification code programmed into it during manufacturing. This code is transmitted as part of the RF signal when you press a button on the remote. Your vehicle is equipped with a receiver that listens for an RF signal from your key fob. And when it detects the signal, it checks for the unique code to verify that it\u2019s the same as the one stored in your vehicle\u2019s memory.\nOnly after the encrypted signal is received and decrypted, the action you request is performed \u2013 locking, unlocking, or starting the engine, for example.\n\nTypes of Keyless Entry Remote Programming\n\nThere are a variety of ways of how to program a key fob, and your vehicle can likely only work with one or two of them. They include:\n\nSelf-programming \u2013 Some vehicles, especially older models, allow you to program the key fob yourself without needing any specialized equipment or a visit to a dealership. This usually involves a sequence of actions, such as turning the ignition on and off, pressing buttons on the key fob, and opening and closing doors within a specific time frame. The exact procedure varies from one vehicle to another.\nDealer programming \u2013 In many cases, key fobs must be programmed by a dealership. They use specialized diagnostic tools to program the new key fob to your car. This method has a cost attached to it, but it may be unavoidable.\nOnboard programming \u2013 Some vehicles come with a built-in programming mode that allows you to pair a key fob through the vehicle\u2019s infotainment system or dashboard controls. This process involves navigating menus, inputting a security code, and following the on-screen instructions to complete programming.\nKey fob cloning \u2013 If you have a working key fob, some locksmiths can create a duplicate or clone. The cloned key fob will have the same unique identification code and encryption as the original, allowing it to work flawlessly with your vehicle.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Programming a Keyless Entry Remote\n\nProgramming a keyless entry remote can vary depending on the vehicle make and model. However, here are general steps that can apply to a wide variety of models for self-programming key fobs. Remember that not all vehicles support self-programming, so always refer to your owner\u2019s manual or consult with a professional locksmith or dealership for specific instructions.\n\nStep 1: Gather all the key fobs \u2013 Collect all the key fobs you want to program, including existing ones. Most vehicles erase previously programmed key fobs during the process, so it\u2019s essential to reprogram them as well.\nStep 2: Enter the vehicle \u2013 Get inside your vehicle and close all doors.\nStep 3: Insert the key into the ignition \u2013 Insert the key into the ignition switch but don\u2019t turn it yet.\nStep 4: Turn the key to the \u2018On\u2019 position \u2013 Turn the key to the \u2018on\u2019 position without starting the engine, and then back to the \u2018off\u2019 position. Repeat this step a specific number of times within a certain time frame (such as three times within five seconds). The exact number of times and the time frame will vary depending on your vehicle.\nStep 5: Enter programming mode \u2013 If done correctly, the vehicle should enter programming mode, usually indicated by door locks cycling (locking and unlocking) or an audible chime.\nStep 6: Press a button on the key fob \u2013 Within a specific time frame, usually about 10 to 30 seconds, press any button on the key fob you want to program. The vehicle may respond by cycling the door locks, flashing the lights, or emitting a chime to confirm successful programming.\nStep 7: Program additional key fobs \u2013 If you have more key fobs to program, repeat step 6 with each key fob within the allowed time frame.\n\nThen, start the engine, turn it off, and test key fobs to make sure they operate. You may need to perform this process several times to get the programming to work \u2013 it can be finicky.\n\nTips and Best Practices\n\nTo make sure it goes well, make sure you follow the steps carefully. Best practices for success include:\n\nPut a fresh key fob battery in before programming.\nHave all of your key fobs on hand before starting the process.\nKeep any electrical devices away from the vehicle to reduce the possibility for interference.\nMake sure you\u2019re using the exact part number as your vehicle requires or it may not work.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\n\nUnfortunately, self-programming doesn\u2019t always work, and it frequently doesn\u2019t work on the first attempt.\nCan\u2019t get the remote to respond when programming? First, check that the part number is the same as the old remote or your second remote. If it doesn\u2019t match, it likely won\u2019t work. Remotes aren\u2019t universal, and the receiver may not be able to recognize a remote with a different frequency or encryption protocol.\nIf the remote is correct for your vehicle, confirm that the battery is new. A weak battery can prevent it from pairing.\nIf you\u2019re trying to pair a second-hand key fob, it may not work due to a poor electrical connection. The battery connections are often a weak spot.\n\nProfessional Help: When to Seek Assistance\n\nSometimes, a professional is the only one able to program a new key fob to your car. If you can\u2019t find a self-programming procedure that works or the remote won\u2019t pair, then you\u2019ll need to contact either a locksmith or a dealership to get the job done for you. They can use the remotes that you supply, as long as they\u2019re correct for your vehicle.",

        "title": "What You Need to Know About Window Lift Motor Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Introduction to Window Lift Motors\n\nIn the most basic form, a window lift motor is a two-way electric motor that\u2019s used to move the pane of glass vertically. It\u2019s controlled by a power window switch that can let the operator stop the window anywhere they\u2019d like along its path. It\u2019s powered by 12 volts and is almost always less than 15 amps per circuit, and they\u2019re often all on the same fuse.\nWhen the switch is activated to move the window up, the window motor draws 12 volts and rotates in a particular direction. When the window reaches its limit or the switch is released/command is canceled out, the window motor no longer receives power and it stops. Pressing the switch down reverses the polarity and the motor rotates the opposite direction, moving the glass pane down.\nThe motor is mounted to a regulator in some fashion, whether it\u2019s a scissor-type, a cable-style with pulleys and guides, or a Bowden-style regulator. It operates in tandem with the motor, and it\u2019s meant to keep the window moving smoothly and in the right path.\n\nFactors Affecting Window Lift Motor Replacement Cost\n\nYour window motor repair cost is affected by a handful of factors:\n\nThe make and model. It\u2019s no secret that parts for some cars are more expensive, and they\u2019re more complex to repair. This is especially true for luxury vehicles.\nThe type of window lift motor. If the motor can be replaced separately, it\u2019s usually on the lower end of the pricing scale. But if the window lift motor is part of the regulator, you can expect it to be costlier.\nThe car\u2019s age. Parts for older cars are typically less expensive, but newer cars have newer technology and higher demand, resulting in higher prices.\nYour locale. Pricing, particularly for labor, varies based on your geographic region, and labor prices are fueled by cost of living.\nThe time it takes to fix. Labor costs increase depending on the length of time to complete the window lift motor replacement.\n\nAverage Cost of Window Lift Motor Replacement by Vehicle Type\n\nTo emphasize the difference in price between different models, we\u2019ve compiled a few different vehicle types with the average cost to replace the window lift motor. Depending on what you drive, though, it could be outside of the range.\n\nSedan \u2013 $276 to $371\nLuxury car \u2013 $725 to $908\nCrossover \u2013 $228 to $341\u00a0\nSport Utility Vehicle \u2013 $243 to $530\nPickup Truck \u2013 $178 to $360\nVan \u2013 $398 to $444\n\nDIY vs Professional Window Lift Motor Replacement\n\nThe average labor time to replace one window lift motor is 2.1 hours. Taking it to a mechanic to change it will cost you for the time spent installing it. With hourly rates ranging from a meager $47 per hour to a flustering $215 per hour, the labor cost on an average repair will add $98 to 451 to the total. What you get for that price is professional installation, often with a warranty on both parts and labor, and a quicker repair than if you do it yourself.\nIf you\u2019re handy with a wrench, it\u2019s a very doable job to replace a power window motor on most passenger vehicles. Expect it to take a little longer than the average labor time since you\u2019re not changing a window motor every day, and you\u2019ll need an assortment of hand tools. But if you\u2019re up to the challenge, you\u2019ll save on labor.\n\nSaving Money on Window Lift Motor Replacement\n\nLooking for additional ways to save money on your window motor? Here are a few ideas:\n\nLook at aftermarket parts instead of OEM. They\u2019re lower-priced, on average, and sometimes carry warranty periods longer than the standard one year provided by carmakers.\nBuy high-grade parts. While they\u2019re more expensive up-front, you\u2019ll likely won\u2019t have to change it again.\nLook for deals. Coupons and discounts pop up once in a while at AutoZone that could save you even more.",

        "title": "Signs of a Bad Window Motor",
        "content": "Common Signs of a Bad Window Motor\n\nThe window lift motor often shows signs of failure before it completely quits. When it malfunctions, its symptoms may include:\n\nNoisy operation. A malfunctioning window motor could have grinding or squeaking sounds while moving the window.\nSlow or sluggish movement. If the window moves very slowly or with difficulty, the motor may be failing. It might also stall partway and you the button may need to be pressed additiona times to finish closing it.\nTotal loss of movement. If the window will not move at all, this could be a sign of a window lift motor failure.\nWindow works intermittently.\u00a0 Sometimes the window may start working again after a time, only to fail again later.\nBurning smell. If you smell a burning odor, it could indicate a short circuit or overheating in the window lift motor.\nAbnormal sounds. If you hear any clunking or rattling noises coming from the door panel, it could be a sign of a loose or damaged motor.\nWindow moves only in one direction. A motor may only allow the window to move in one direction, indicating the motor has an internal failure.\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, it may be time to replace your window lift motor.\n\nCauses of a Bad Window Motor\n\nFor most people, the window motor is going to fail due to wear and tear. It\u2019s from using it literally hundreds of times, and the electric motor\u2019s carbon brushes wear out. However, internal failures can also be from other issues like bad wiring, water that\u2019s penetrated into the motor or connector, dirt or debris that has caused abnormal wear, and even lack of lubrication.\nA window motor is contained between the inner door shell and the outer door skin, so it\u2019s almost impossible to prevent problems from occurring. One suggestion is to keep your vehicle clean to avoid dirt from entering the door, but that\u2019s going to have limited success.\n\nDiagnosing a Bad Window Motor\n\nTesting a power window motor is the best way to determine if it has failed. Rather than remove the motor for testing, you can often access the wiring for the switch first to diagnose.\nOn the door where the window isn\u2019t working like it should, disconnect the switch from the wiring connector. Apply a 12-volt power source directly to the connector using probes, listening and feeling for any motion from the motor. If it works, reverse the probes and test if it works in the opposite direction.\nIf there are strange grinding noises, the motor moves slowly, or it doesn\u2019t move properly in one or both of the two directions, the window lift motor is the culprit.\n\nFixing a Bad Window Motor\n\nHow to replace a window lift motor differs depending if the motor is part of a regulator assembly or if it can be replaced separately. In either case, the window should be brought to the top (if that\u2019s possible) and the battery disconnected, then the interior door panel removed.\nUnclip the electrical connector. Next, the window motor or the regulator assembly needs to be unfastened \u2013 again, it depends on the style your car uses. The part will fit through an opening in the door shell, and the new one will fit into the door in the same way. Reconnect everything in the reverse order, then test to ensure the window is operating properly again.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Window Lift Motor",
        "content": "Introduction to Window Lift Motors\n\nThe window lift motor works by receiving an electrical signal from the window control switch, which tells the motor to either move the window up or down by rotating the motor in one direction or the other. For some vehicles, the motor directly drives a gear on a scissor-style track, lifting and lowering the glass. On others, the motor is integrated into the regulator and the window\u2019s motion in the guides is from cables attached to the motor. Other types also exist, but these are the most common.\n\nWhen Should You Replace a Window Lift Motor\n\nLike any electrical motor, age, wear and tear, corrosion, and contamination can cause problems over time. Regardless of the impetus for the problem, common signs of a window motor failure include:\n\nSlow or intermittent operation. If the power window moves slowly, stops partway, or it takes a while to complete a full cycle, there could be a problem with the motor.\nStrange or loud noises. If you hear strange or loud noises coming from the door like grinding or squealing when you try to raise or lower the window, this is a sign that the motor is wearing out or failing.\nWindow won\u2019t move. If the window is completely stuck in one position and won\u2019t move, the motor may be dead and need to be replaced.\nWindow operates only in one direction. If the window only moves up or down in one direction, or if it moves in the opposite direction when commanded, this could be a sign that the motor is failing.\nPower window switch fails to operate the window. If you push the button to operate the window, but nothing happens, the power window motor might\u2019ve quit.\n\nHow to Instal a Window Lift Motor\n\nInstalling a replacement window motor can be done with typical tools you\u2019ll find in a well-equipped garage including screwdrivers, sockets and a ratchet, and trim removal tools. Before you start disassembly, roll the window up completely if you can, then use masking tape to secure the top edge to the frame. This will prevent the glass from falling while you work.\nThen, disconnect the battery to prevent accidental operation of the window motor while you\u2019re working.\n\n1. Removing the Old Window Lift Motor\n\nThe first step is to gain access to the window lift motor. It\u2019s mounted inside the door, so begin by taking the door trim panel off, along with any related hardware like interior door handles and armrests.\nNext, locate the mounting bolts for the window motor or regulator assembly. With the new part already purchased, you should be able to determine which bolts or screws fasten the glass to the regulator (if applicable) as well as the motor\u2019s mounting bolts. Remove them through access points in the interior door skin, then work the old motor out of the door. Be careful \u2013 impacting any portion of the glass can cause it to break. Then, unplug the connector on the motor.\n\n2. Installing the New Window Lift Motor\n\nWork your new window lift motor into the door, following the same path that the old one came out. Line up the screws or bolts, then tighten them to the spec indicated in the service manual for your particular model.\nNext, if your window lift motor is part of a complete regulator assembly, attach the window glass to it. Be extremely cautious since overtightening these fasteners can shatter the window.\n\n3. Testing the New Window Lift Motor\n\nWith your replacement window motor installed, connect the battery cables again and test the window operation. If it works normally, you\u2019re all set to go.\nOn some vehicles, you may need to retrain the window limits or it may not travel all the way closed. This process varies by manufacturer.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Brake Light Switch",
        "content": "When to Replace a Brake Light Switch\n\nNot all vehicles will experience the same symptoms when the brake light switch goes bad. That said, there are some signs that are quite common and can point you in the right direction.\n\nThe brake lights don\u2019t come on when you press the brakes. If the switch fails with the circuit open or the plunger wears or breaks, the brake lights won\u2019t come on when pressure is applied to the brake pedal.\nThe brake lights stay on all the time. If the switch shorts and the circuit is continuously closed, your brake lights could stay on indefinitely, even when the ignition is turned off.\nThe cruise control won\u2019t set. Since the brake light switch is typically the trigger to cancel your cruising speed, it won\u2019t allow your cruise control to set if it\u2019s not working.\nYou may have trouble using your gear shifter. That can include moving your shifter out of park or between gears that require your foot to be applied to the brake pedal first.\nA brake warning light or ABS light can come on. This indicator simply warns that there\u2019s a fault in the braking system.\n\nAny one or a combination of these symptoms should lead you to test the brake light switch. If there\u2019s a problem with it, don\u2019t hesitate. Replace the switch right away so you can restore safe driving.\n\nReplacing a Brake Light Switch\n\nWhen you\u2019re working on the electrical system, even for a component as seemingly minor as the brake light switch, it\u2019s strongly encouraged to disconnect the battery. By doing so, you\u2019ll prevent the potential for a short circuit that could blow the fuse or cause burnt wiring.\nAlso, mark the brake switch position if possible. It can minimize the need for any adjustments when the new switch is installed.\n\n1. Removing the Old Brake Light Switch\n\nDepending on the vehicle you drive, the location and style of mounting for the brake light switch can vary. Many are mounted on the brake pedal lever while others are mounted on a bracket next to it. Some are tucked under the dash and require some disassembly to access.\nOnce you\u2019ve located its position, disconnect its wiring harness and tuck it safely out of the way. Remove the switch, either by unclipping it or unbolting it from its mount. Ensure you have the correct replacement part before discarding it.\n\n2. Installing the New Brake Light Switch\n\nYou\u2019ll install the new brake light switch in exactly the reverse order. Fit the new switch into the mounting location, ensuring it\u2019s secured properly. Then, attach the wiring pigtail to the connector on the switch.\nAdjust the position to match the old part as closely as you can, then connect the battery cables.\n\n3. Testing the New Brake Light Switch\n\nTest that the brake lights come on and go off properly when the brake pedal is pressed. There should be a small amount of movement before it activates, typically between 1/4-inch and 1/2-inch, but that varies according to your vehicle, so find the correct spec in the service manual.\nThen, test drive your car. Check that the shift lever moves appropriately only when the brake pedal is pressed, and ensure the cruise control sets and disengages as it should.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Brake Light Switch",
        "content": "What Causes a Bad Brake Light Switch?\n\nA bad brake light switch is typically caused by wear or damage to the switch itself, the wiring or connectors leading to the switch or the brake pedal mechanism that activates the switch. Over time, the switch can become worn or damaged due to regular use and exposure to moisture and dirt in the footwell. Imagine how many times you press the brake pedal for every mile you travel in stop-and-go traffic, and what that means for times the brake light switch operates.\nAdditionally, if the brake pedal is not adjusted properly, it can cause stress on the brake light switch, leading to premature wear. In some cases, electrical issues or problems with the brake light circuit can also cause issues with the brake light switch, such as a blown fuse or a faulty relay.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad Brake Light Switch\n\nIf you have a bad brake light switch, symptoms can vary depending on your vehicle. However, two of the most prevalent and common are that the brake lights stay on all the time if the switch fails in the closed position, or the brake lights won\u2019t illuminate at all when the pedal is pressed, indicating a failure in the open position.\nThese symptoms aren\u2019t exhaustive, though. Other potential concerns can include:\n\nThe cruise control won\u2019t set or it cancels unexpectedly\nBrake lights flickering or activating intermittently\nThe shift interlock won\u2019t disengage, and you can\u2019t move the gearshift lever normally or it might be stuck in park\nAn ABS light illuminated\n\nSome redundant switches \u2013 a secondary switch that\u2019s either integrated or altogether separate \u2013 can confuse you with the symptoms. For example, you might not be able to set your cruise control but the brake lights illuminate normally.\n\nHow to Diagnose a Bad Brake Light Switch\n\nIf you suspect that you have a bad brake light switch, here are a few diagnostic steps you can take:\n\nWatch the brake lights. Normally, the simplest way to check whether or not your brake light switch is working is to observe the brake lights when you apply the brakes. If the brake lights don\u2019t come on or work intermittently, there\u2019s a good chance the brake light switch is faulty.\nCheck the fuse. A blown brake light fuse can also cause the brake lights to fail, so check the fuse box to make sure the fuse hasn\u2019t blown.\nRemove the brake light switch. You can remove the switch and check for signs of damage or wear. Look for any cracks, melted plastic, or frayed wires. It\u2019s also a good idea to clean the switch with a wire brush and reconnect it to see if that fixes the problem.\nUse a multimeter.\u00a0 If you have a multimeter, you can use it to test the continuity of the brake light switch. First, disconnect the switch and set the multimeter to the continuity setting. Then, touch the leads of the multimeter to the two terminals on the switch. Press the switch. If there\u2019s continuity when it\u2019s pressed and it stops when the switch is released, the switch is working properly.\nTest the power supply. You can also use a test light to check whether the brake light switch is getting power or not. With the ignition on and the brake pedal pressed, connect the test light to the negative terminal on the battery and then touch the other end to one of the wires on the brake light switch. If the test light doesn\u2019t light up, there\u2019s a problem with the power supply to the brake light switch.\n\nIf any of these tests indicate a problem with the brake light switch, it will need to be replaced. It\u2019s important to consult your service manual or a professional mechanic if you\u2019re unsure of how to replace the brake light switch on your specific vehicle or if any issues arise during the replacement process.",

        "title": "Cost to Replace a Blown Car Fuse",
        "content": "Factors that Affect the Cost of Replacing a Blown Car Fuse\n\nCar fuses help to protect the car\u2019s electrical devices from sudden power surges. A blown fuse can cause a variety of problems, from the failure of the car\u2019s radio or wipers to complete electrical failure. It\u2019s important to replace a blown car fuse, but the cost of replacing a blown fuse can vary depending on several factors.\n\nType of Fuse. Fuses come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and their prices vary accordingly. Generally, the cost of a standard blade fuse is lower compared to a special fuse, which could be more expensive.\nLabor Cost. The labor costs of replacing a blown fuse will depend on the complexity of the job. In some cases, replacing a fuse can be a simple process and can be done without the need for a mechanic. In other cases, a blown fuse needs to be diagnosed to determine the root cause of its failure.\nVehicle Make and Model. The cost can vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle. Some cars may have more intricate electrical systems that require a specialist to perform the replacement, resulting in higher labor costs, as well as hard-to-find or unique fuses that cost more.\nDifficulty of Replacement. The location of the blown fuse can also determine the cost of replacement. In some cars, fuses are located in an easily accessible location, while in others, they may be hidden or hard to reach. The more difficult it is to access the fuse, the higher the replacement cost.\nWarranty. If your car is under warranty, the cost of replacing a blown fuse may be covered by the warranty provider. However, the coverage offered may not apply if the problem is due to a user error or an aftermarket accessory installation.\n\nEstimating the Cost of Replacing a Blown Car Fuse\n\nThe cost of replacing a fuse depends on things like the make and model of the car, the cost of the fuse, and the labor charges by the mechanic. Usually, the purchase price of a fuse itself is quite low, often just a few dollars. However, the cost of labor can vary widely depending on where you take your car for service.\nIn many cases, you\u2019ll need to account for around an hour\u2019s worth of labor at a shop to replace a fuse, which usually include basic diagnostics to determine the cause of burning out. Keep in mind that fuses don\u2019t blow for no reason at all, so there\u2019s likely a repair you need to perform to prevent it from happening repeatedly.\nIf a new fuse doesn\u2019t power up the circuit, there could already be damage to the fuse box itself. If that\u2019s the case, the cost to replace the fuse box will be costlier and should be done b a professional.\n\nTips for Saving Money on Replacing a Blown Car Fuse\n\nIf you\u2019d rather save your resources for more complex issues, there are ways to save some cash on fuse replacements. Tips can include:\n\nCheck if your car still has warranty. Not only are most fuses covered under basic car warranty if it\u2019s due to a manufacturer\u2019s defect, but the cause of its failure may be covered too.\nBuy your parts from AutoZone rather than the dealership. Prices on aftermarket parts are notoriously less expensive, on average, and they\u2019re often the same parts that are used when your car is manufactured.\nChange the fuse yourself. It\u2019s a fast job that any DIYer can do in a few minutes.\n\nTips on Replacing a Blown Car Fuse Yourself\n\nBefore you begin replacing fuses, be sure that the ignition is off and the key is out. For an extra precaution, disconnect the negative battery terminal too. That way, you won\u2019t have a short circuit or a spark.\nWhen you look under the fuse block cover, there\u2019s often a small pair of pincers inside. This is meant to help you grasp and remove a fuse from its location \u2013 specifically blade-style fuses. Simply place one end of the tool over the burnt fuse, squeeze it, and wiggle the blown fuse out.\nIf your car doesn\u2019t have the tool under the cover, use a pair of needlenose pliers instead. Bear in mind that some fuses like stud mount fuses need to be unbolted before they can be changed, so be sure there aren\u2019t any fasteners to remove.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Blown Car Fuse",
        "content": "What Causes a Blown Car Fuse?\n\nThere are a handful of different fuse styles that are commonly used in cars today, particularly blade fuses in standard, mini, and maxi sizes. There may also be glass fuses in older vehicles, larger high-amperage fuses, as well as fusible links and other lesser-used styles. Regardless of the type of fuse, the cause of a blown fuse is almost always from something on the circuit demanding more power than the fuse is rated for.\nFor example, a worn power window motor might need more energy to move the window glass up, or a chafed wire is grounding out on a sharp edge, closing an electrical loop with a higher current than the circuit should have. Like a light bulb, the filament in the fuse heats up and burns through. When that happens, the circuit is completely disconnected from the power source, often saving it from damage.\nFuses can blow or break in other less common ways like a jarring impact, but it\u2019s far more likely your blown fuse is related to an electrical fault.\n\nSymptoms of a Blown Car Fuse\n\nThe most likely blown car fuse symptoms are related to electrical functions not working at all. That\u2019s almost always one specific system affected, with acute signs like:\n\nPower door locks not cycling\nOne or more power windows not going up or down\nHeater fan not working\nPower outlets not functioning\nThe radio quits working or lighting up\nThe windshield wipers won\u2019t work at all\nHeadlights, taillights, or other lighting systems aren\u2019t functioning\n\nOccasionally, you might detect a slight burning odor when the fuse first blows, and some vehicles might even have a dashboard warning of \u201cCHECK FUSES\u201d. Once a fuse blows, the affected systems will not operate at all until the fuse is replaced, but an electrical diagnosis should be done to ensure the problem doesn\u2019t persist.\n\nHow to Identify a Blown Car Fuse\n\nGenerally, there are three ways to identify a blown car fuse:\n\nPerform a visual check. Most common fuses are transparent and you can see the filament running through it. The filament must be continuous from one terminal to the other for current to flow. If the filament is broken through, there\u2019s melting visible, or there are black or brown burn marks inside or on the outer portion of the fuse, it\u2019s an indication the fuse is blown.\nUse a circuit tester/test light or DVOM. These pieces of diagnostic equipment are fairly simple to use and can indicate if there\u2019s continuity from one side of the fuse to the other.\nReplace with a known good fuse. Another easy way to determine if a fuse is the culprit for a problem is to replace it and test if the system begins working again.\n\nChecking for a bad fuse is one of the less complicated tests you can perform on your car. However, simply replacing the fuse might not be all that\u2019s required. If the fuse blows again, especially if it happens immediately, there\u2019s another problem that needs to be diagnosed and corrected on that circuit.\n\nTips for Replacing a Blown Car Fuse\n\nChanging a fuse isn\u2019t rocket science, but doing it right is necessary or it could damage the new fuse or the wiring or parts on that circuit. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:\n\nAlways replace the fuse with the exact same fuse rating as the original. Most cars have a diagram on the fuse panel lid with the fuse rating listed. Using an oversized fuse rating can result in permanent damage to electrical components or burnt wiring.\nUse the fuse puller in the fuse compartment (if equipped). It\u2019s the easiest and safest way to pull a fuse without cracking it. A pair of needlenose pliers can also be helpful if they\u2019re used gently.\u00a0\nIf the fuse sparks and burns out immediately on installation, it indicates an issue like a short to ground that needs to be fixed.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Car Fuse",
        "content": "Types of Car Fuses\u00a0\n\nThere are several different types of car fuses available, and it\u2019s important to choose the correct type for your specific make and model. The most common include:\n\nBlade fuses\nMini blade fuses\nGlass tube fuses\nHigh-current/mega fuses\nAnd Maxi fuses\n\nBlade fuses are the most standard type used in passenger vehicles and feature two metal blades that fit into a plastic case. Mini blade fuses are similar in design but are much smaller than their regular-sized counterparts. Glass tube fuses have a cylindrical external casing with two metal ends. High-voltage fuses have a variety of designs but are much more durable and used for high-current applications like starters and alternators. And maxi fuses are like gigantic blade fuses for some of the most energy-consuming systems.\n\nHow to Identify a Blown Fuse\n\nBlown fuses in car systems aren\u2019t always the easiest to find at a glance. While it can be tricky, it\u2019s important to check the fuses to make sure your vehicle is functioning safely and properly. One of the easiest ways to identify a blown fuse is by examining the metal filament in the transparent plastic casing. If they have melted or if there is discoloration, chances are that the fuse has blown.\nYou can also use a multimeter or circuit tester to measure electrical resistance across the prongs of the fuse and see if current is flowing through it. Another easy way to test for a blown fuse is by replacing it with another one that has the same rating and seeing if it allows the circuit to power up or not.\n\nHow to Replace a Car Fuse\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the bad fuse, it\u2019s time to change it. The process of how to change a fuse in a fuse box can be intimidating, especially for larger fuses, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. Before you begin, purchase a new fuse of the exact same type and amperage rating as the old fuse.\n\n1. Before Replacing a Fuse\n\nEnsure the ignition is turned off and the key is out of the car, and always keep yourself and your equipment away from the cooling fan and drive belts in case they activate unexpectedly. Even better, disconnect the negative battery cable to prevent current from flowing at all.\n\n2. Replaceing Blade-Style Fuses\n\nFor blade-style fuses including standard, maxi, and mini blade fuses, it helps to have a fuse puller or a pair of needle-nose pliers. Gently grip the edge of the fuse and pull it out, gently rocking it side to side if there\u2019s too much resistance. Once the fuse comes free, simply line up the prongs on the new fuse and push it in place.\n\n3. Replacing Larger Blown Fuses\n\nFor any larger blown fuses in car high-energy systems, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re fastened in place with screws or bolts. Identify if they\u2019re just held in with tension or if you\u2019ll need a screwdriver or socket to get it free. Remove any fasteners and remove the blown fuse to discard it. When you\u2019re installing the new fuse, fasteners often need to be tightened to spec or they won\u2019t have the proper conductivity. Locate that specification and use a torque wrench to install it.\n\n4. Reconnect Battery Cable\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finished installing your new fuse, connect the battery cable again and check that the circuit is now powering up. You\u2019ll probably have to reset the radio station presets and any other memory settings to finish the job.\n\nTips and Tricks for Replacing Car Fuses\n\nAny DIYer can safely change a car fuse, and it doesn\u2019t take long. To ensure it\u2019s done safely and with as little potential for problems as possible, here are some tips and tricks:\n\nKeep an assortment of common fuses your vehicle uses in your glove box.\nDisconnect the battery before changing the fuse to prevent the possibility of a short circuit or accidentally blowing the fuse.\nPush blade-style fuses in by hand to prevent cracking or breaking them.\nA visual check of blade fuses is often successful in identifying a bad fuse, but it isn\u2019t always perfect. Don\u2019t hesitate to double-check a fuse with a multimeter or test light even if it looks like the filament is intact.",

        "title": "How Does a Car Electrical System Work?",
        "content": "What Is the Car\u2019s Electrical System?\n\nThe electrical system in any vehicle is a network of components and circuits that deliver current to power, switch, signal, or otherwise help perform operations. For internal combustion engine-powered vehicles, it\u2019s considered a closed circuit that generates its own electricity whenever the engine is running.\nHousehold electrical systems in the US are typically considered 110/120V, but cars use a much lower voltage. They\u2019re considered 12-volt systems, although a battery normally stores around 12.6 volts when it\u2019s at rest. When the car is charging, it can be up to 14.8 volts.\n\nParts to the Electrical System\n\nThis complex network has several key components, and each has a task or tasks to manage. While there are others, these are six of the most notable parts to consider in a standard car electrical system.\n\nBattery. A car battery is a storage device that powers the electrical system whenever the engine is off, and its main role is to deliver the power necessary to start the engine. It\u2019s also a reserve energy source when the engine is running, which is also when it replenishes its charge. The battery consists of six cells, each slightly more than two volts each. They store electrical energy by converting it to chemical energy, then converting it back when it\u2019s demanded by systems in the car.\nAlternator. The alternator, also more accurately known as a generator, amplifies a tiny charge from the battery into a high-amperage current whenever the engine is running, using the principles of electromagnetism. The power it generates is used to power systems while the car is on, and excess energy is delivered to the battery to top it up so it can start the engine the next time it needs to.\nStarter motor.\u00a0 The only job the starter motor performs is to initiate the combustion process by moving the crankshaft from a stop. It spins the flywheel or flexplate, employing gear reduction to make the most of its effort. It\u2019s a high-amperage electric motor and, once the ignition is disengaged, the starter stops rotating and retracts until the next time it\u2019s needed.\nElectrical wiring. All electrical components require power and/or communication, and electrical wiring is routed throughout the vehicle to connect the systems together. The wires are joined with connectors when they need to be able to disconnect for service, and the thickness or gauge of the wiring varies depending on how much current the system requires. For example, battery cables and starter motor cables are much thicker than wires that carry speed sensor signals.\nFuses. To protect electrical circuits, a vehicle is equipped with one or several fuse panels. Fuses are inline circuit breakers that burn out when a circuit is drawing more current than it can safely handle.\u00a0\u00a0\nRelays. These devices are normally found in fuse panels as well, and they act as an electrically operated switch that allows current to flow in a specified direction when it\u2019s activated. They\u2019re commonly used for controlling power windows, headlights, and other high-power circuits that a normal switch alone can\u2019t handle. Relays can take a small electrical input to switch a high-powered circuit safely and reliably.\n\nHow the Electrical System Works\n\nLet\u2019s look at some basics of how the electrical system works through common processes.\nFrom a stop, your battery stores chemical energy. When you need to start the car and turn the key in the ignition, a low-amperage signal is sent through thin wiring to a relay that switches, and high-amperage current is delivered to the starter through a thick cable. The starter motor jumps into action, turning the engine over until it fires up. Then, the ignition key is released, the relay closes, and the current to the starter is cut off.\nOnce the engine is running, a small current is sent to the alternator \u2013 again, through a relatively thin wire. The drive belt spins the alternator, and a rotating mass spins inside a stator, creating an electrical field, amplifying the current that it\u2019s receiving. The high-amperage power is then sent to the fuse panel where it\u2019s distributed through protected circuits to the rest of the vehicle\u2019s electrical system as required, including to the battery to replenish its charge.\nThis is a high-level overview of just two basic operations in the electrical system, and hundreds of additional operations are performed every time you get behind the wheel. By understanding some of the basic principles and parts in the system, you can better care for your vehicle and ensure it\u2019s running like it should.",

        "title": "Car Speaker Buying Guide",
        "content": "Types of Car Speakers\n\nGenerally, you can break down speakers into three categories: component, coaxial, and subwoofers. And depending on the vehicle you drive, you could have one or more types installed. Or, if you\u2019re doing an upgrade, you\u2019ll need to know what each type brings to the table.\n\nCoaxial speakers come in two varieties: 2-way and 3-way. 2-way speakers feature two drivers that produce both the high and low frequencies while 3-way models feature three drivers that create both highs, mids, and lows. They\u2019re common for factory-installed speakers too. Coaxial speakers generally offer good sound quality at an affordable price point, making them a popular choice for budget conscious shoppers.\nComponent speakers are typically higher quality and consist of multiple speaker types in the same system, hence why they\u2019re called components. They typically consist of one speaker for the highs and a separate woofer for the lows. This allows you to customize the sound according to your needs. Component speakers are usually more expensive than other types of car audio but provide excellent sound quality.\nSubwoofers are specifically designed for deep bass tones. They are often larger than other types of car audio systems and can produce powerful low frequency sounds without distorting or losing clarity. Subwoofers can be used to complement any existing car audio system, enhancing its overall sound quality.\n\nSpeaker Features and Specifications\n\n6\u00d79-inch, 6.5-inch, 5 1/4-inch, 4-inch, and 3.5-inch. These common speaker sizes produce a diverse range of tones. Typically, the smaller the better for high-range sounds that make audio sound clearer. As you get larger, the added surface area responds better to low frequencies, so there\u2019s more bass from bigger sizes.\nAside from speaker size, power handling is a spec to take note of. It refers to the maximum power that a speaker can handle before it becomes damaged. This is usually measured in watts, and a higher wattage rating usually translates to louder sound and larger bass response. An underpowered speaker may not be able to produce the sound that you want, and be sure that your amplifier has enough power output to drive your speakers properly.\nThe sensitivity rating refers to the amount of sound pressure a speaker can produce with a given amount of power. Typically, this is measured in decibels (dB). A higher sensitivity rating means that the speaker will be louder at lower power levels, while a lower sensitivity rating indicates that it takes more power to reach the same volume level.\nDifferent materials can affect how a speaker sounds, with soft materials like natural fabrics absorbing more sound, while hard materials like metal reflecting sound back into the cabin. Generally, larger magnets produce louder and clearer sound because they generate more power. Speakers with a curved shape or cone-shaped design are better at producing bass and mid-range frequencies, but you might need a shallow speaker to fit the location.\n\nFactors to Consider When Buying Car Speakers\n\nYou want your audio system to sound clean and crisp, loud enough for your taste, and most of all, you want your parts to last. These five criteria should be top of mind whether you\u2019re buying the best car speakers money can buy or OEM replacements.\n\nSound quality can greatly affect your listening experience. Factors like speaker type, size, and shape all have an impact on sound quality, so make sure to do research before you make a purchase to get the best possible outcome for your car\u2019s audio system.\nCompatibility is arguably the most important factor to consider. If you\u2019re looking for direct replacements, the speaker needs to have the same mounting holes, depth, and even the resistance in ohms needs to be compatible. Otherwise, it\u2019s not going to function as it should, if at all.\nPrice, of course, is also a consideration. You can get a standard OEM replacement or a low-cost, no-frills speaker starting around $15 or so. But if you have the money to spend, you\u2019ll get far greater sound from more expensive options.\nInstallation makes a difference too. If you aren\u2019t technically savvy, you might want to have a mechanic install your speakers for you.\n\nBrand reputation should always be in mind when you\u2019re shopping for auto parts, including speakers. For speakers that sound the best, are built to last, and often have technical assistance only a phone call away, choose a brand name you recognize or that gets excellent reviews online.\n\nTips for Choosing the Best Car Speakers\n\nKeep in mind that buying car speakers can be extremely simple like replacing OEM speakers, or beyond complicated with aftermarket upgrades that are like opening Pandora\u2019s box. Here are a few tips:\n\nRead up on speaker installation techniques. If the resistance doesn\u2019t match your original speakers, you might be able to use them still by bridging them \u2013 that\u2019s another topic altogether.\nDon\u2019t skimp. While there are many cost-effective speakers on the market, the only bang for your buck is a blown speaker.\nKeep it simple, if possible. Upgrades are fine if you are capable of running speaker wires and power wires to install speakers and amplifiers, but high-grade direct replacements maintain your electrical system integrity and keep everything clean.",

        "title": "Car Stereo Buying Guide",
        "content": "Compatibility with Your Vehicle\n\nNot all car stereos are compatible with all car models based on a couple of criteria. First, the size of the factory head unit needs to be considered. Your factory-installed unit might be a single-DIN \u2013 roughly two inches tall \u2013 or double-DIN, a DIN and a half, or potentially an even more unusual size. There are usually install kits that can fill the gap if you install a single-DIN unit in a larger space, but the opposite isn\u2019t always true.\nSecondly, the unit\u2019s depth needs to factor in. Many vehicles today don\u2019t have CD players, so the unit doesn\u2019t need to be as deep into the dash. That limits the options that will fit into to factory location, obviously, since a deeper radio will jut out further from the dash console.\nAlso, it needs to be compatible with factory equipment. Some vehicles have external amplifiers that need a power source \u2013 often delivered through the head unit \u2013 in order to power the speakers.\n\nBudget Considerations\n\nThere are massive differences from the economy radios to top-end infotainment head units in terms of features, appearance, screen size, and more. While a new head unit can cost as little as $50, it can also range to more than $400 \u2013 even more if you\u2019re shopping for an OEM radio unit.\u00a0\nBeyond the car stereo itself, consider whether you want to upgrade the speakers or install and amplifier and subwoofer. That can exponentially increase the costs you\u2019re looking at.\nThen, there are costs to keep in mind like the stereo mount and a direct-fit wiring harness that makes installation faster and easier. All in, you could be anywhere from $100 to more than $1,000, so you need to set a budget and stick to it.\n\nSound Quality\n\nThe head unit you choose doesn\u2019t affect the sound your speakers are capable of producing, but it certainly can limit the potential or help them achieve it. A head unit is essentially sending digital messages to the speakers, so car stereos with better technology tend to get more crisp sounds, better adjustability for tone and balance, and they have extra channels to add speakers and amps to go even bigger.\nEntry-level car stereos are more limited in their capability while mid-level and high-end units won\u2019t compromise on sound quality.\n\nFeatures to Look for in a Car Stereo\n\nWhat boxes should you tick when you\u2019re shopping for a car stereo? Here are six things to consider:\n\nAM/FM Radio. For listening to local radio stations and broadcasts, this feature is a must. Most modern stereo head units come with built-in FM/AM antennas, but connect your factory antenna for better reception.\nCD Player. If you\u2019re still rocking out to CDs, make sure you\u2019re looking at units that are equipped with a CD slot. Choose one with a large display and touchscreen interface for easy selection of music files.\nBluetooth Connectivity. To stream music and make calls using your smartphone\u2019s Bluetooth connection, this feature is essential in modern cars. Look for models with hands-free calling capabilities for added convenience, and external mics have better calling clarity.\nNavigation. If you want navigation assistance while on the road, then this feature will come in handy. Many head units come with preloaded maps that can be updated regularly for more accurate directions.\nAux Inputs and Outputs. Auxiliary inputs and outputs are also available in car stereos, allowing users to connect other portable audio sources such as MP3 players and tablets via cables.\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto. Smartphone users will love the ability to use their in-car radio to control their favorite apps, and these systems have excellent mapping and navigation integration too.\n\nTips and Tricks for Choosing the Right Car Stereo\n\nWith so many options on the market, narrow down the selection for yourself. Along with making sure it has all the features you need and want, here are a few tips and tricks to finding the right one for you.\n\nMeasure the display size. Get the same DIN size as the original so the replacement doesn\u2019t look out of place \u2013 and so it will actually fit!\nLook for one that integrates your steering wheel controls. You don\u2019t always have to give up your audio controls on the wheel, although you might need to buy an extra adapter.\nConsider a DVD-capable unit. If you enjoy watching movies in your car, drive-in style, get a DVD unit. Of course, ensure you\u2019re parked before viewing.\nCheck user reviews. Your peers will help you identify the best car stereos based on star ratings and reviews.\nLook for vehicle compatibility. Shop using your vehicle information to eliminate many non-compatible units.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "EV Maintenance Cost: What You Need To Know\u00a0\u00a0",
        "content": "How Expensive Is EV Maintenance Compared to Gas Vehicles?\u00a0\n\nAccording to a Consumer Reports analysis, EVs cost roughly half as much as a similar internal combustion engine-powered vehicle for routine maintenance. Over the first 50,000 miles, an ICE vehicle averages nearly three cents per mile in maintenance, rising to almost eight cents per mile between 100,000 and 200,000 miles. Over its lifetime, each mile driven costs just over six cents in related maintenance and repairs for an accumulated cost of $9,200.\u00a0\u00a0\nElectric vehicle maintenance costs almost exactly 50 cents on the dollar compared to ICE vehicles. Over the first 50,000 miles, BEVs can expect to spend only 1.2 cents per mile, rising to just over four cents per mile during the 100,000 to 200,000-mile stretch. The lifetime average is just 3.1 cents per mile with an overall lifetime savings of $4,600.\u00a0\nNaturally, the savings in maintenance needs to be tempered with the higher purchase price for EVs, but lower service-related expenses bring electric cars a lot closer to parity with lifetime ownership experiences.\u00a0\n\nWhat Does Electric Vehicle Maintenance Include?\u00a0\n\nWhat maintenance does an electric car need? Compared with non-EV models, the services an electric car requires are fewer and a lot further between. Taking one of the most popular recent models into consideration, the Ford F-150 Lightning, these are the items scheduled for routine maintenance and how often they\u2019re required:\u00a0\n\nVehicle inspection. A multi-point vehicle inspection is due every 12 months or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first. It checks the brakes, cooling system, halfshaft boots, tires, steering, and suspension components for wear or damage.\u00a0\nTire rotation. To promote even wear across all tires, a tire rotation is scheduled once per year or every 10,000 miles.\u00a0\nBrake fluid change. Every three years, regardless of mileage, the brake fluid must be replaced to remove moisture-contaminated fluid from the system.\u00a0\nCabin air filter. Every 20,000 miles or less, the cabin air filter should be replaced.\u00a0\u00a0\nTransmission fluid change. The transmission fluid must be drained and refilled every 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first. Not all EVs have serviceable transmissions, though.\u00a0\nCoolant change. The cooling fluid for the battery pack must be changed, typically every 150,000 to 200,000 miles or five to 10 years.\u00a0\n\nWhat Other Services Need to Be Done?\u00a0\n\nAside from the routine scheduled maintenance, are there any other common services an EV needs? Some maintenance items will need to be performed as required on an inspection, but not necessarily on a schedule such as:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWheel alignment. Driving over potholes or hitting a curb affects EVs just like any other vehicle. A wheel alignment might be necessary from time to time to center the steering wheel or correct a pull.\u00a0\u00a0\nTire replacement. Since EVs are heavier than a comparable ICE vehicle, the tires experience more wear and tear. You can expect to replace the tires more often, and specialty EV tires are currently more expensive than your average tire.\u00a0\nBrake jobs. Like any other vehicle, EVs have brake pads and rotors that will wear as they\u2019re used. Although regenerative braking reduces the amount of wear they experience, an EV\u2019s brake pads and rotors will need to be replaced in time.\u00a0\u00a0\nWiper blades. Roughly once per year, the wiper blades will need to be replaced to keep a clean, clear view of the road.\u00a0\nBulb replacement. While LEDs are much more prevalent in EVs, any incandescent bulbs are still susceptible to burning out and may need to be changed every few years.\u00a0\nBattery pack balancing. If the range begins to deteriorate, battery balancing might be required to regain battery health.",

        "title": "EV Charger Buying Guide\u00a0",
        "content": "The Different EV Charger Levels\u00a0\n\nThere are several levels of EV chargers available, which can be classified based on the amount of power they can deliver to an EV\u2019s battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nLevel 1 chargers are the slowest type of chargers and are typically used for overnight charging at home. They use a standard 120-volt AC outlet and can add about three to five miles of range per hour of charging.\u00a0\nLevel 2 chargers are faster than Level 1 chargers and are typically used for home charging or at public charging stations. They use a 240-volt AC outlet and can add about 10 to 30 miles of range per hour of charging, depending on the specific charger and the EV being charged.\u00a0\nLevel 3 chargers, (also known as DC fast chargers) are the fastest type of chargers and are found at public charging stations. They use direct current (DC) power and can add about 60 to 100 miles of range per hour of charging, depending on the specific charger and the EV being charged, but they aren\u2019t available for home installations.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re choosing an EV charger for your home, it will either be a Level 1 or a Level 2 charger.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatures to Look For\u00a0\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for an EV charger, there are a handful of features you should consider. They include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompatibility with your EV. Make sure the charging station is compatible with your EV and can connect to its charging port. Some charging stations may only be compatible with certain types of EVs or charging connectors. Most Level 2 systems have the J1772 connector, which is nearly universal.\u00a0\nPower output. Consider the power output of the charging station, which is typically measured in amperage for home systems. A higher power output may be able to charge your EV\u2019s battery faster, but it may also be more expensive to buy. Level 1 is typically up to 20 amps while Level 2 is between 15 and 80 amps.\u00a0\nConvenience. Look for a charging station that has a long enough cable to reach both sides of your vehicle so you can back into the spot if you\u2019d like.\u00a0\n\nConnectivity. Some charging stations may offer additional features such as Wi-Fi connectivity or the ability to monitor and control your charging session remotely through a smartphone app.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou should also take into account the ease of installation. Your garage or parking space may have limited power available, or there may only be a 120v outlet installed for Level 1 charging. An electrician may be necessary to upgrade or install a new line for the charger and outlet. Some options are hardwired while others have a wall outlet to plug into.\u00a0\n\nDifferent EV chargers\u00a0\n\nBest Level 1 charger: Lectron 110 Volt Electric Vehicle Charger\u00a0\n\nThe Lectron Level 1 EV Charger features a 21-foot-long cable that will reach your car from the wall outlet in your garage or parking space, even if it\u2019s on the other side of your car.

        "title": "How to Reset the Battery Management System",
        "content": "What is a Battery Management System (BMS)\n\nWhat is a BMS? Like any battery, from chemistries including lead-acid and lithium-ion, degradation is a factor that needs to be watched. Over time, batteries will lose the ability to recharge to their original capacity, and it\u2019s the Battery Management System, or BMS, that keeps watch over the battery pack. The BMS is responsible for monitoring all of the factors that contribute to its State of Health, or SoH including the current, voltage, and temperature. It also balances the battery pack to ensure each cell in each module has the same voltage.\nWith the data it monitors and collects, the BMS controls how much charge the battery will accept and projects the range until the battery reaches its discharge limits.\u00a0\n\nWhat causes BMS failure\n\nLike the electronic modules in a car with an internal combustion engine, calibrations can sometimes go off-track. The BMS for battery electric vehicles is typically thrown off when it can\u2019t monitor the battery over a broad State of Charge (SoC) range.\nWhat does that mean? The BMS needs to measure the battery\u2019s health when it\u2019s fully charged as well as at various other charge levels. The BMS does this checkup on the battery\u2019s status when the battery pack is stable, which is usually after it\u2019s been sitting for several hours. That\u2019s when the kinetic energy inside has settled and become consistent across all the cells.\nIf it\u2019s usually plugged into an EV charger immediately after it\u2019s parked, the BMS will only check the battery\u2019s health when it\u2019s fully charged or close to it, and the calibration slowly slips out of its normal values. It also happens if the SoC is kept in a mid range \u2013 say 70% \u2013 and it only goes on short trips.\nIdeally, the BMS would experience the extreme charge ranges occasionally to measure the SoH across a spectrum of charge levels.\n\nSymptoms of a failing BMS\n\nAs an EV battery\u2019s \u2018brain\u2019, the BMS is crucial to maintaining safe and long-lasting performance. Since it\u2019s responsible for keeping tabs on the safety limits, variations in its calibration will usually narrow the window of how the battery can be used.\u00a0\nSymptoms of improper BMS automotive calibrations can include:\u00a0\n\nReduced electric vehicle driving range.\nThe display shows less than 100% when it\u2019s fully charged.\nLonger charging times than normal.\nShorter lifespan of the EV battery.\n\nHow to reset a BMS\n\nFortunately, the BMS calibration can usually be reset. It\u2019s a good idea to perform a BMS reset if your EV doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to get stable readings across a wide range of charge levels. Dealerships may have a procedure that can reset or calibrate the BMS on the spot, but these steps can help bring the BMS data back into normal ranges and restore your range.\n\n1. Bring the battery to a low state of charge\n\nDrive the car until the charge level drops to 10% or below. Single-digit SoC is ideal. When the battery is discharged to this level, the BMS is able to monitor the battery and more accurately determine the lower limits of the discharge rate.\n\n2. Let the battery charge stabilize and monitor\n\nTo ensure the BMS can monitor the EV battery pack, let the battery stabilize for at least an hour while keeping the systems \u2018awake\u2019. All this takes is checking your car in its app or locking or unlocking the door. \n\n3. Charge the car fully\n\nAfter an hour or so, charge the car completely. If you\u2019ve set your battery charge limit below 100%, change it back to 100% so the BMS can calibrate most accurately. \n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Should I Get an Electric Car?",
        "content": "What Should You Consider Before You Buy an Electric Car?\n\nFluctuating gas prices may make jumping into an electric car purchase, but it\u2019s essential to understand all the aspects of electric cars. There\u2019s a lot to consider, from electric car benefits, like tax incentives and fewer emissions, to disadvantages like high battery replacement costs. Here are a few aspects you need to think about as you decide to buy an electric car.\u00a0\n\nWhat are electric vehicles?\n\nElectric vehicles have an electric motor in place of the typical internal combustion engine. A battery powers the car and is charged by a wall outlet or electric vehicle charging station. Because it does not use gas, electric vehicles don\u2019t have fuel pumps, lines, and tanks.\u00a0\nThe cars include charging ports and a DC/AC converter which changes DC power from the car\u2019s battery to lower voltage DC power that can operate other vehicle components and keep the supplementary battery charged.\u00a0\n\nPros and cons of owning an electric vehicle\n\nThere are a lot of benefits of an electric car. But, there are a few features to be aware of as you move through deciding whether to purchase an electric vehicle or not. Here are the good and sometimes challenging aspects of owning an electric car.\u00a0\n\nPros\u00a0\n\nTax credit \u2013 Some electric and hybrid cars sold in and after 2010 are eligible for a tax credit of $7,500. The credit depends on the battery capacity. Even if you\u2019re not eligible for the total incentive, a partial one may still be possible. This pro may be an attractive feature for those looking to save some money on their next car purchase.\u00a0\nNot needing to fuel up \u2013 This is especially helpful when gas prices rise. Electric cars don\u2019t require you to be dependent on the fluctuations of gas prices, which is convenient.\u00a0\nLower maintenance \u2013 Because you don\u2019t have to deal with the typical car components like fuel tanks or pumps, you can bypass a lot of the maintenance that comes with non-electric vehicles. You won\u2019t have to get oil changes or deal with consistent and common traditional vehicle issues like exhaust system failures since you don\u2019t have them.\u00a0\nBetter for the environment \u2013 Electric vehicles are friendlier to the environment than traditional cars. Because the car runs on electricity, you don\u2019t have to worry about emitting carbon into the atmosphere, which can pollute the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCons\u00a0\n\nLimited charging stations \u2013 Because there are limitations to how many stations are around, you may have to look harder to find one or go out of your way to search for one.\u00a0\u00a0\nHigher upstart costs \u2013 If you live in an area that isn\u2019t around a lot of charging stations, you may need to install a charging station in your home. This can significantly increase your upstart costs when buying an electric vehicle. Also, while charging may be less expensive, it still costs, especially during peak times.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore expensive repairs \u2013 While you\u2019ll likely not have to take your car to the mechanic as often as you do for a non-battery-powered vehicle, you may still need a repair at some point. Electric car components like batteries can be expensive to replace.\u00a0\nLong charging times \u2013 Electric vehicles take much longer to charge than when you go to fuel a gas-powered car. It could take a half-hour or even longer, depending on how much charging the car needs. This task is something you\u2019ll have to plan for during your commute.\u00a0\n\nElectric vehicles can be an excellent option for individuals looking to reduce their environmental footprint or want a lower maintenance vehicle. However, it\u2019s essential to understand the benefits of electric cars and disadvantages if you want to buy an electric car so you can make an informed decision.\u00a0\n\nHow much does an electric vehicle cost?\n\nThe cost of an electric car can vary. Over the past decades, more automakers are starting to include more makes and models that range in various price points.\u00a0 For example, depending on the trim and features, the 2022 Chevrolet Spark, a subcompact car, retails around $15,000. On the other hand, the Tesla Model X SUV starts at around $121,000.\u00a0 It\u2019s highly likely that the larger or more luxurious the car, the higher the price will be.\u00a0\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Electric Car Maintenance\n\nSince electrical systems, including the battery and motor, usually don\u2019t need as much routine servicing, car buyers can save some money on electric car maintenance costs by not having to regularly take their cars to the mechanic.\nHowever, there are still some things car buyers need to do to ensure their electric vehicle performs at the necessary level. Here are a few electric vehicle maintenance tasks you should keep up with.\n\nElectric Vehicle Fluids\n\nWhile you won\u2019t need to change the oil, electric vehicles still need some fluids to function. For example:\n\nCoolant \u2013\u00a0 Any EVs using a thermal management system use coolant that heats and cools the motor and battery.\u00a0 Depending on the vehicle, replacing the coolant can cost around $200.\nWindshield washer fluid \u2013 You\u2019ll likely add this throughout various parts of the year. Changing out the windshield fluid reservoir can cost around $200.\nBrake fluid \u2013 You\u2019ll want to check for corrosion in the brake fluid to identify when it needs to be changed out. Replacing electric car brake parts can set you back $300 to $400.\n\nBattery Maintenance\n\nElectric vehicle batteries are intended to last for the life of the vehicle, with some having warranties of 8 years/100,000 miles, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. However, batteries have a limited amount of time they can be charged and discharged, also known as their cycle life. Because of this, a battery may need replacement outside the warranty. Batteries are likely the most expensive part of electric vehicle maintenance.\u00a0 The cost to replace one can range from $2,500 to over $20,000.\n\nThe best way to maintain and extend your car\u2019s battery life is to:\n\nNot fully charge it \u2013 A full charge isn\u2019t the best for a lithium-ion battery\u2019s health, so if possible, try to keep your battery charged to 80%.\nKeep the battery at the right temperature \u2013 Try to keep your electric vehicle in a place with moderate temperatures. If it\u2019s too hot or cold, the car may try to self-heat or cool, which can take energy from your battery.\nAvoid high-speed charging \u2013 A high-speed charging process can put extra current into your battery, further straining it. So, as much as possible, try to charge overnight or plan to charge slowly.\n\nIn addition to maintaining your battery, you also need a well-made charging cable. If you need a new EV battery charging cable, check out the Lectron 110 Volt 16 Amps Level 1 Electric Vehicle Charger or Lectron 250 Volt 40 Amps Tesla to J1772 Adapter. Both are some of our highest-rated cables.\n\nLectron 250 Volt 40 Amps Tesla to J1772 Adapter for Electric Vehicle Chargers\n\nBuy Now \n\nLectron 110 Volt 16 Amps Level 1 Electric Vehicle Charger with 21ft Extension Cord J1772 Cable and NEMA 5-15 Plug\n\nBuy Now \n\nTires\n\nElectric vehicles typically need different tires than conventional combustion engine cars. They are heavier, have torque that needs better traction than a traditional tire, and can have faster acceleration. All of these factors contribute to electric vehicles needing special tires. However, tire maintenance is similar to conventional cars. Every few months or however long indicated by your owner\u2019s manual, you\u2019ll need to get them rotated, which can cost around $100. You should also check for a deep tread depth and low air pressure.\n\nBrakes\n\nAs mentioned above, you should regularly test the brake fluid for corrosion. However, it\u2019s important to note electric vehicle brakes typically require less maintenance because the cars use regenerative braking. The brakes use the car\u2019s kinetic energy to slow down, taking the strain away from the brakes. Nevertheless, you still need to keep an eye on your brakes.. A brake fluid flush can cost around $100 if you get it done professionally.\n\nSuspension\n\nAs mentioned above, electric vehicles are typically heavier than conventional cars. For that reason, it\u2019s crucial to do routine checks of the car\u2019s suspension and chassis every 7,500 miles. Look for any wear, tear, or leaks. Again, while these vehicles are meant to withstand a lot of activity, you may need to replace the suspension system down the line. You may need to switch out items like shocks and struts or sway bar. The average replacement costs for shocks and struts are around $500 and over $1,000, but this could vary for electric vehicles.\n\nShocks and Struts\n\nBuy Now \n\nSway Bar\n\nBuy Now \n\nFilters\n\nBecause electric vehicles don\u2019t use traditional gas and oil-powered systems, many conventional filters you would need to switch out are no longer necessary. The cabin air filter is the only filter system you\u2019ll likely have to maintain in the car. These filters keep particles and dust from making their way into your vehicle. Eventually, air filters give out, and the last thing you\u2019ll want is for dust, allergens, and bacteria to make their way into your car. Having a professional replace your air filter could cost around $61 to over $70, but this can vary for electric vehicles.\n\nMaintenance for your electric vehicle doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. Check out our inventory for items that can help you service and maintain your electric car.\n\nCabin Air Filter\n\nBuy Now",

        "title": "Electric Car vs. Gas Car: Which is Best for You?\u00a0",
        "content": "Gas vs. Electric Cars: What\u2019s the Difference?\u00a0\n\nThe primary difference between gas and electric cars is how they\u2019re powered. Gas-powered cars have a combustion engine. In a gas-powered car, the gasoline is converted into heat, which the car turns into mechanical energy that moves it. So, gas-powered cars need fuel and exhaust systems to operate. Alternatively, electric cars don\u2019t use gas, meaning they don\u2019t need to convert fuel or gas into mechanical energy.\u00a0\u00a0\nThey instead use electric motors and batteries to power cars. However, much like gas cars, electric vehicles have to \u201crefuel,\u201d but instead of using gas, they are powered by electrical charging stations. Because electric cars don\u2019t use fuel, they don\u2019t have many of the systems gas-powered cars do. For this reason, electric cars usually require less maintenance than gas-powered vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPrice of Electric Cars vs. Gas Cars\u00a0\n\nIt used to be that many felt that electric cars were a lot more expensive than gas-powered cars. Over the years, the affordability gap has slowly started to close. For example, at the time of this writing, a new electric Chevy Spark would retail for a starting price of $15,000. On the other hand, a new Kia Rio costs approximately $16,450 (depending on location and trim).\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re looking for a gas-powered mid-sized sedan like a Toyota Camry, expect to spend around $26,000 for a new model. A compact car like the new Nissan Leaf currently retails for under $28,000.\u00a0\u00a0\nRegarding SUVs, electric vehicles tend to cost more than gas-powered cars. For example, the starting cost for a new Kia Sportage is $25,990, while a 2023 Toyota BZ4X starts around $40,000.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany electric cars are still classified as luxury vehicles, and while there are a few affordable options, car buyers have many more gas-powered car choices to choose from if they\u2019re shopping on a budget.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMaintenance Costs of Gas vs. Electric cars\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSince electric cars have fewer fluid-requiring systems, they don\u2019t need as much regular maintenance as gas-powered cars. So, oil changes, brake replacements, and exhaust-related maintenance are unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, electric vehicles still do require maintenance. For example, things like cabin air filters need to be replaced as well as coolant fluids. Additionally, you\u2019ll still need to get tire rotations and replacements.\u00a0\u00a0\nAccording to a study by WePredict, a predictive analytics company, after three years of ownership, the average maintenance cost for a gas-powered vehicle is $228. For electric cars, the average expense drops to $77. These figures coincide with a study by the U.S. Department of Energy that found that electric vehicles cost 6.1 cents per mile to maintain while gas-powered cars cost 10.1 cents.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Electric Cars\u00a0\n\nPros\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFewer moving parts \u2013 Electric cars have fewer moving parts than their gas counterparts. This contributes to the vehicles needing less maintenance and fewer repairs over the car\u2019s lifetime since there are fewer components that can malfunction. \nMore energy efficient \u2013\u00a0 Typical electric vehicle batteries can transform about 60% of their energy toward the vehicle\u2019s operation. Alternatively, gas-powered cars only convert their fueling to around 20%. So, you can expect more efficiency from electric car charging than gas. \u00a0\nLow maintenance \u2013 While you do need to maintain an electric vehicle still and may even still need to get repairs, it typically requires less maintenance than a gas-powered vehicle. Much of this is due to electric vehicles having fewer moving parts and a power system that doesn\u2019t need fluids to run (which need to be changed out for the car to work correctly).\u00a0\nBetter for the environment \u2013 You can feel good knowing that electric vehicles compared to gas-powered vehicles, are better for the environment. Since their systems are purely electric, they don\u2019t emit any carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that can wear away the ozone layer.\u00a0\n\nCons\u00a0\n\nMore expensive \u2013 Electric cars tend to be more expensive than gas-powered vehicles. While you can find some lower-priced models, gas cars typically have more affordable options across various vehicle types (ex., SUVs, mid-sized sedans, etc.). Also, electric cars can require high upstart costs. If you don\u2019t live in a city with many charging stations, you may have to install one in your home, which adds to the high cost of purchasing an electric car.\u00a0\u00a0\nLimited charging stations \u2013 States are installing more electric vehicle charging stations. However, depending on where you live, you may still need to travel a significant distance to find one. This situation can be an inconvenience compared to gas-powered cars with many fueling stations.\u00a0\u00a0\nLong charging times \u2013 Whereas it may take a few minutes to fill up your gas tank, it can take a half-hour or even longer to fully charge your electric vehicle. You\u2019ll have to figure this time lag into your commute times, which can be another inconvenience.\u00a0\u00a0\nBattery replacement can be a large expense \u2013 Since electric vehicle operation centers around the battery, its health is crucial to running your electric car. Unfortunately, lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles are still relatively expensive. So, if you need to replace one after your car\u2019s warranty is up, it could be a significant expense.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Gas Cars\u00a0\n\nPros\u00a0\n\nFilling up the gas tank is fast and easy \u2013 Unlike electric cars, where you may have significant charging times, filling up a gas tank is reasonably quick. Gas stations are typically located throughout cities, including even small towns. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to worry about driving long distances to find a place to fill up.\u00a0\u00a0\nMore affordable \u2013 Typically, gas cars are more affordable than electric cars. Additionally, you have more options within the different vehicle types to find a price point that fits you. So, while there may be subcompact and mid-sized electric vehicles priced under $30,000, there likely won\u2019t be as many as gas-powered cars.\u00a0\nA longer range \u2013 Gas-powered cars usually have a higher range than electric vehicles, meaning they can go for long distances on a full tank than an electric vehicle can on a full charge. Some electric vehicles have comparable ranges, but it depends on the car.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCons\u00a0\n\nLess fuel efficiency \u2013 Gas-powered cars are less efficient than their electric counterparts. Cars convert a smaller percentage of gas into actual energy than electric cars.\u00a0\nHigher maintenance costs \u2013 Gas cars usually have more maintenance requirements than electric cars. Because the car needs fluids to run, you\u2019ll have to regularly service and maintain fueling, oil, and exhaust systems.\u00a0\u00a0\nPollute the environment \u2013 Pollution is a significant drawback of gas cars. The emission of greenhouse gases does negatively impact the environment. They may also have an additional not-so-favorable impact on the environment with leftover toxic waste, like oil or other fluids.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRegarding the conversation of gas vs. electric cars, compelling arguments can be made on both sides for why one is better than the other. Ultimately, your preference will depend on how each advantage or disadvantage impacts your lifestyle.",

        "title": "How Much Does an Alternator Replacement Cost?",
        "content": "Factors Affecting the Alternator Price\u00a0\nNew alternators might all look roughly the same, but differences between them will affect their price. They include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe year, make, model, and engine size. Only an exact match for your car\u2019s needs will do, so always shop for parts like the alternator taking its specs into consideration.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe amperage. Smaller alternators that don\u2019t need to generate as much electricity for the car tend to have less high-value material content like copper used in the windings. Thus manufacturing costs are lower. It isn\u2019t always the case, though.\u00a0\u00a0\nIts mounting style. Since the alternator needs to fit perfectly, you can\u2019t choose a low-cost alternator intended for a different car. It won\u2019t work.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe types of electrical connections. Alternators for older cars that are considered 1-wire alternators often are lower priced, while 3-wire alternators tend to be more expensive.\u00a0\nThe new part\u2019s warranty. Choosing a new part with 1 year of warranty compared to a similar part with a lifetime warranty will, expectedly, cost you more money initially.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Role of the Alternator\u00a0\n\nCars today require a surprising amount of power. Not only are there obvious systems that need power like the radio, power windows, door locks, sunroof, and heated seats but there are modules and sensors all around as well. As an example, the anti-lock brakes usually have a wheel speed sensor at every wheel, an anti-lock brake control module, an ABS pump, and other related parts that all need constant access to power.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe alternator takes power from the battery and amplifies as an electromagnet to provide enough electricity to maintain operations for all your car\u2019s electrical needs while the engine is running. It also generates enough power to deliver some back to the battery, topping up its charge. The alternator\u2019s magnetic rotor and copper windings create an alternating current (AC), then a set of diodes in the rectifier convert it to direct current (DC), the type of electricity your car\u2019s devices need in order to operate. The voltage output is regulated to prevent damage from overcharging as well as issues with too little power.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the alternator isn\u2019t producing between 13.5 and 14.5 volts, creating noises, or if the wrong type of current is finding its way through the alternator is failing, and it needs to be replaced.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSigns You May Need a New Alternator\u00a0\nRepair costs are often unavoidable. Once symptoms of a bad alternator are present, it becomes a question of whether you can avoid extra costs from related repairs. If you have one or more of these symptoms, it might be time to change the alternator.\u00a0\n\nDead Battery: The battery sends a massive electrical current to the starter when you crank the engine over. If you have a dead battery, it can be a warning sign that the alternator isn\u2019t replenishing the power drawn by the starter.\u00a0\n\nIlluminated Battery Light: but it warns of a charging problem. It could be undercharging or undercharging, two conditions that can be caused by a fault alternator, among other things.\u00a0\n\nBurning Smells: A pungent burning rubber smell may be a belt slipping along the alternator pulley if it\u2019s beginning to seize, and a burning electrical smell could be a fault inside the alternator.\u00a0\n\nLighting Issues: You might notice your interior and exterior lights are dimmer than normal or are abnormally bright. There could be flickering as well. This can be from inconsistent voltage from the alternator.\u00a0\n\nUnusual Electrical Issues: Odd happenings in your car may not seem related to the alternator, but it\u2019s always a possibility. Low voltage can cause slow power window motors, crackling or fading out from the radio, low fan speed, and a host of other electrical problems.\u00a0\nAvailability of cores to rebuild. Alternators are either remanufactured or new, and the majority of the aftermarket is remanufactured. Rarer vehicles and options produce rarer alternators, which means there\u2019s less cores coming back to rebuild, which means higher costs.\u00a0\n\nWhirring Under the Hood: All else might be working fine, but a whirring or whining noise under the hood can spell disaster for the alternator soon. Worn or corroded alternator bearings can mean a seize-up is impending.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCan I Drive With An Alternator Problem?\u00a0\nMost of the time, a short drive is fine when the alternator isn\u2019t charging enough. The battery\u2019s reserve power can substitute electricity, such as if you\u2019re driving a few blocks to the repair shop. However, if your alternator is overcharging, it could damage computer modules, the battery, and other electronics or wiring even during a short drive.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you detect an alternator problem, it should be a top priority to have it fixed. If you\u2019re unsure if it\u2019s safe to drive, play it safe and arrange a tow truck to get it to your destination.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow Often Does an Alternator Need to Be Replaced?\u00a0\n\nUnlike your brake pads, tires, or even the serpentine belt, it\u2019s tough to gauge how long an alternator will last. For some cars, it will last for the car\u2019s lifetime while for others, it will require replacement more than once during its course of action.",

        "title": "How Long Does an Alternator Last?\u00a0",
        "content": "How is an Alternator Made?\u00a0\nRegardless of which car make and model you drive, an alternator\u2019s general design has remained the same for decades.\u00a0\u00a0\nAn external case is made of aluminum to contain all the critical workings, and the choice of material is intentional. Aluminum does not magnetize so it won\u2019t interfere with the alternator\u2019s function.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe alternator pulley is mounted on the front of the assembly. Cars with a V-belt for the alternator will have a single deep groove in the pulley while cars that use a serpentine belt have a flatter surface with multiple shallower grooves.\u00a0\nThe stator is a bundle of copper wires fashioned into three windings and fixed to the inner surface of the case or shell. It delivers the generated power to the battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe rotor is the magnetized rotating mass attached to the pulley by a shaft. It\u2019s connected to power, creating an electromagnet that generates the alternating current electrical field in conjunction with the stator.\u00a0\nThe rectifier converts power from an alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) that your car\u2019s devices need.\u00a0\nA voltage regulator controls how much power can pass from the windings to the conductor to power your car. On older vehicles before 1980, many voltage regulators were external, mounted somewhere in the engine compartment. Since then, they have been internally located within the alternator.\u00a0\u00a0\nOther parts such as bearings, wiring, brackets, and brushes ensure the alternator continues to function reliably for years.\u00a0\nWhy an Alternator Can Fail\u00a0\nDesigned for longevity and dependability, an alternator can seem indestructible. For some cars, the alternator can and does last its complete lifetime but that isn\u2019t always the case. Inside, there are parts that can wear down or there can be sudden failures. It might generate less electric energy than it\u2019s supposed to, it can be sporadic, or it can be completely out of commission with zero output.\u00a0\n\nWorn brushes reduce the alternator\u2019s conductivity and can be the source of many alternator problems.\u00a0\u00a0\nExcessive energy demands from the battery and electrical system can make the alternator charge at maximum capacity, shortening its lifespan.\u00a0\u00a0\nDecreased output from failed or corroded sections of the rotor can mean the alternator doesn\u2019t function well enough, requiring a repair.\u00a0\u00a0\nA regulator issue can mean an overproduction or underproduction of electrical energy.\u00a0\u00a0\nCorroded or broken electrical connections inside the alternator can interrupt current flow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSometimes, a failure doesn\u2019t mean that the alternator isn\u2019t charging. It\u2019s possible that bearings can fail from an overtightened belt or due to wear, which starts as an annoying noise, but can lead to mis-alignment of moving parts, and catastrophic failure.\u00a0\u00a0\nSymptoms of a Bad Alternator\u00a0\nWhen an alternator goes bad, symptoms are sure to appear. They can vary depending on the cause of failure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA battery light on isn\u2019t actually related to a battery problem. Rather, it\u2019s indicating a charging system fault when the voltage is above or below the normal operating range. It comes on when the alternator output is above 15 volts or below 12 volts.\u00a0\nDim headlights and interior lights are a common symptom since they\u2019re receiving less than the normal 12 volts of power.\u00a0\nWhining under the hood can occur when the alternator is struggling to keep up with the car\u2019s demand for power.\u00a0\nA burning smell is another common occurrence when the belt is slipping on the alternator pulley and when there are overheating electrical connections in the alternator.\u00a0\nThe engine can stall while you drive when your car\u2019s critical systems don\u2019t have the required voltage to maintain their operations.\u00a0\u00a0\nA dead battery may be directly related to an alternator that\u2019s unable to produce power, thus it doesn\u2019t charge the battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany of the symptoms of a bad alternator can be caused by other issues too, so an accurate diagnosis is important to prevent spending money on repairs unnecessarily.\u00a0\nHow Do You Change an Alternator?\u00a0\n\nThe alternator is driven by a belt from the front of the engine, so it\u2019s almost always located in an accessible location. Some cars have other components in the way that must be removed or relocated to access the alternator but, in many cases, the job can be done in around an hour or so.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhile the exact process to replace an alternator varies by model, begin by disconnecting the negative cable from the battery for safety. Then, remove the serpentine or alternator belt. Disconnect the wiring from the alternator itself being careful not to damage any plastic connectors, then remove the fasteners that hold the alternator to the engine. Install the new alternator, making sure you\u2019ve chosen an exact replacement based on the car\u2019s year, make, model, and engine size. After connecting the battery cable, start the car and test that your alternator is working properly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso, if changing an alternator isn\u2019t a job you want to tackle, check out our list of Preferred Shops in your area to help you complete the job.\u00a0\u00a0\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How Much Does an Alternator Belt Cost?",
        "content": "What Does the Alternator Belt Do?\u00a0\n\nYour serpentine belt is moving whenever the engine is on because it powers essential systems like the alternator, the air conditioning, and even the engine coolant pump, known as the water pump. Even if your car is idling, these systems need to be working so the belt never stops. As you can imagine, this creates wear on the belt and it is definitely an item that you want to replace at regular intervals.\n\nHow Much Can I Expect to Pay for My New Belt?\u00a0\n\nThe most expensive common belts cost about $50-60, but you can sometimes find belts for $10, too. There are many good-quality belts available in the $20-$40 range. If you decide to replace the idlers and tensioner pulleys at the same time, you can get kits in the range of $80-$150 that include all the parts necessary to give you peace of mind that your serpentine belt will be reliable for years to come.\n\nWhy Should You Replace Your Alternator Belt?\u00a0\n\nHow often should you replace the serpentine belt? All belts have a recommended service life, and with modern rubber and manufacturing technology those limits have become pretty high. Most new serpentine belts are rated to last between 60,000 and 100,000 miles, but there are good reasons to replace the belt sooner than that. Here are a few:\u00a0\n\nIf the belt is showing signs of wear like fraying on the edges or cracking on the grooved side, that\u2019s a sign that you may want to replace it.\u00a0\nIf the belt has discolored spots, that may be a sign that it is breaking down.\nIf your engine\u2019s belt has become contaminated with fluids like oil or engine coolant, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on it. Modern rubbers are very resilient, but fluids can be corrosive or cause the rubber to swell.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you are replacing your alternator or other engine parts that connect to the serpentine belt then it makes sense to replace the serpentine belt at the same time since everything is taken apart already and the cost of the belt will be small, compared to the costs of other parts and the labor involved.\u00a0\nSome serpentine belts are \u201cstretch belts\u201d which must be replaced any time you remove it from the vehicle, so if you have a stretch belt and take it off for any reason then you need to replace it. Check your car\u2019s manual for that information.\u00a0\n\nWhat Other Parts of the Car Does that Effect?\u00a0\n\nYour serpentine belt winds its way through many different pulleys in the engine bay, providing power to a host of different and essential systems. Many vehicles use a belt-driven water pump to provide coolant fluid circulation throughout the engine. If the belt breaks while the engine is running, your engine temperature will rise, the car will overheat, and the result could do permanent damage. Another potential safety issue related to the serpentine belt is your power steering, but this is becoming less common because many modern passenger vehicles have switched to electric power steering. Your alternator, though, is guaranteed to be powered by the serpentine belt, and if it breaks your vehicle will only run until your battery is exhausted.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAre There Other Parts You Should Replace at the Same Time?\u00a0\n\nAre There Different Grades or Qualities of Belt?\u00a0\n\nJust like anything, you can get a range of serpentine belts, from very inexpensive belts to highly engineered belts designed for racing. If you replace your belt within the recommended service life interval and check it every time you pop the hood, a mid-range belt should serve most drivers.\n\nCan I Replace the Serpentine Belt Myself?\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised at how many general repairs and maintenance items you can do yourself! Replacing the serpentine belt, idlers, and tensioner pulley typically requires a socket set and a set of screwdrivers, plus about an hour of work if you haven\u2019t done it before. Don\u2019t be afraid to try this important repair and be sure to stop in at an AutoZone store or shop online for all the tools and parts required for your project. \nKeep in mind if the repair appears to be too difficult, take a look at our Preferred Shops in your area that can help you tackle the job.",

        "title": "Bad Battery vs. Bad Alternator: Which One Is the Problem?",
        "content": "What is your car battery responsible for?\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s battery has one primary responsibility: to provide enough energy to start the car. Aside from this, it will also provide backup power to your vehicle accessories for instances when your alternator is not running at full spin because the engine RPMs are too low. This may happen frequently in city driving, especially in stop and go traffic, or a traffic jam where you\u2019re stuck in one spot for a while. It also provides all the power to any accessories that need to be on while the car is not running, like a security system or dashcam.\u00a0\nStarting a car takes anywhere from 400 to 600 amps normally, and can range up to 2,000 amps, depending on the size of the engine. Smaller car engines will be on the lower side of that scale, whereas large commercial vehicles may have a big diesel powerplant that requires the upper end of the scale. Because of the incredible strain put on automotive batteries to start the car, their design is optimized to discharge a lot of current in the starting phase and then recharge immediately. If a battery is started repeatedly without fully recharging, it can start to lose its ability to retain a full charge and you may begin to see battery issues.\u00a0\n\nWhat symptoms indicate a battery problem?\n\nThe battery\u2019s main function is to start the vehicle, so the most obvious symptom of a bad battery will be failure to start the car. If you turn the key or press the start button and nothing happens, it\u2019s a good bet that your battery is completely depleted. If you get a clicking sound but the engine doesn\u2019t turn over, it\u2019s often a sign that the battery is just about dead. Another sign of a bad battery is very slow cranking when you\u2019re turning over the engine to start the car. Very slow cranking also happens in northern locations where the super-low temperatures cause the engine components to be stiff and the battery voltage to drop. A block heater or oil pan heater can help to mitigate that problem.\u00a0\n\nWhat is your alternator responsible for?\u00a0\n\nYour alternator is a small generator that produces the electricity your car needs to run all the accessories and recharge your battery at the same time. The output voltage of an alternator will be between 13 and 14.5 volts and the amperage output can vary, depending on the vehicle. Most passenger vehicle alternators have a maximum amperage between 130 and 200 amps, but you can get alternators that are rated up to 400 amps, depending on the application. If you install a high-power stereo system with massive subwoofers you may want to upgrade your alternator because those subs will pull a lot of amps and reduce the amount going to recharge your battery.\u00a0\u00a0\nAlternators aren\u2019t always running at maximum output, either. When your car is idling, like in heavy traffic or at a stoplight, the engine RPMs are too low to maximize alternator output, so it will focus on providing power to the engine ignition and the essential accessories like cooling fans, water pumps, and HVAC. Your battery won\u2019t be receiving a full recharge in that scenario.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat symptoms indicate an alternator problem?\n\nIf you\u2019re concerned that your alternator is beginning to fail, there are some early warnings to look out for. One potential warning of a bad alternator is if your headlights or interior lights are running dim or are dimming and then getting brighter, depending on how fast you are driving. This indicates that the alternator is providing inconsistent voltage. If other electrical accessories in the car are starting to do weird things, like shutting off unexpectedly or operating poorly, that\u2019s another sign that you need to check the alternator.\u00a0\nIf your car won\u2019t start because of a dead battery, try to jump start it. If it starts but dies again after a short time, that may be a sign that your alternator isn\u2019t functioning properly because your alternator provides the power to the engine ignition.\u00a0\n\nHow to tell if it\u2019s your battery or the alternator that is causing the problem\n\nYou can test your alternator by starting your car and using a multi-meter across the battery terminals to measure voltage If the voltage is between 13 and 14.5 volts, then your alternator is charging the battery. Further tests can determine if the alternator is supplying the correct amperage under load, which can also be done at any AutoZone location. If the voltage is below 13 volts or if it is fluctuating wildly, the alternator is likely suspect and will need to be removed and bench tested. This can also be performed at any AutoZone to determine if the fault is in the alternator, or the wiring circuit between the alternator and battery. \u202f\u00a0\n\nHow can I prevent problems with my battery or alternator?\u00a0\n\nIf your driving habits include infrequent short trips and many days of not driving, you may deplete your battery and damage its ability to recharge. You can either make a point of taking the car for a longer drive on the highway once a week, or you can install a trickle charger to keep the battery topped up. It\u2019s also a good idea to clean your battery terminals and connections with a wire brush periodically and apply some dielectric grease to the contact points. Dielectric grease helps to improve the electrical connection and also protects the surface from corrosion.\nWhether you\u2019ve settled on the car battery being at fault or the alternator needing to be replaced, or if you simply need tools to accurately diagnose the concern, AutoZone can help. Ask an AutoZoner for Trusted Advice or choose the parts and tools you need online for quick delivery or pickup.

        "title": "Can An Alternator Drain a Battery?",
        "content": "How A Bad Alternator Can Drain a Battery\n\nContrary to its purpose, an alternator can drain a battery. It\u2019s rare, but it\u2019s possible. A draw on the battery only occurs if there\u2019s a problem with either a component in the alternator itself or connections to it.\u00a0\nAlternators contain a rectifier that converts the current from an alternating current (AC) that the alternator generates to a direct current (DC) that your car\u2019s electronics need. The rectifier uses diodes to allow the current to travel only one direction along the circuit. A bad diode in the rectifier can allow current to pass the wrong direction through the circuit, even when the engine is no longer running. It\u2019s like the tap on a water jug that has a constant trickle, eventually depleting the resource it holds inside. It\u2019s called a parasitic draw or drain.\nAs well as a parasitic draw, a bad alternator can prevent the battery from charging. It may not be directly running down the battery, but an alternator that produces insufficient energy might direct all of its production to devices inside your car, and the battery\u2019s stored energy might be summoned to top up the power those systems need. This can also be due to bad diodes but can also be from a failed voltage regulator, worn brushes, or corroded connections inside the alternator, not to mention bad connections or broken wires externally.\u00a0\n\nHow to Perform a Parasitic Drain Test\n\nA parasitic drain is frustrating to deal with since it can be intermittent and often leaves you with a dead battery when you least expect it. In some cases, it can be severe enough to deplete your fully charged battery overnight. Although you can test any circuit for a parasitic draw, this is how it works for a draw on an alternator, and all you need is a digital multimeter.\n\nFully charge the battery. For accurate results and enough time to finish testing, a full battery is recommended.\nTurn off powered devices. Remove the key from the ignition, accessories you have plugged in, turn off your dome light, and wait at least 30 minutes for computer modules to go to \u201csleep\u201d.\u00a0\nTest circuits for power where there shouldn\u2019t be any. Place the multimeter into the DC milliamps setting and connect its black cable to the battery\u2019s negative post. Probe the negative battery cable with the red lead on the multimeter set to the highest limit, then slowly turning it down until it detects amperage. If you have much more than 50 milliamps of draw, there\u2019s a parasitic load in your car.\u00a0\nNext, remove the alternator fuse and recheck for draw. If the parasitic draw is gone, the alternator is to blame.\nPerform an alternator diode test. To confirm your suspicion, set your multimeter to AC Volts (ACV) and reconnect the battery cable. With the engine running, touch the red lead to the positive battery post and the black lead to the negative post. If there\u2019s more than 0.5 ACV, the alternator likely has one or more bad diodes.\n\nCan an Alternator Overcharge a Battery?\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, it\u2019s also possible for an alternator to overcharge the battery. This happens when the alternator\u2019s output is more than the typical 13.5 volts to 14.5 volts for an extended period of time. It can happen that voltage spikes to 16 volts for a moment but it isn\u2019t healthy for that to be sustained.\nOvercharging is usually due to a problem with the voltage regulator inside the alternator. It constantly switches on and off to maintain voltage output in the \u201csweet spot\u201d. If the voltage regulator sticks or doesn\u2019t receive a signal to turn off, the output could be sustained over its safe range.\nIt\u2019s unsafe to maintain an overcharging condition, perhaps more so than a parasitic draw. Too much charging can cause the battery to heat up and the fluid inside to boil. Too much voltage can blow fuses or cause damage to electrical components and wires too.\u00a0\n\nHow to Deal with a Bad Alternator\n\nWhether you have a battery drain caused by the alternator or it\u2019s overcharging, immediate attention is necessary. If you\u2019re unsure how to accurately diagnose the condition or you want a second opinion, a licensed mechanic is a resource you should seek out.\u00a0\nAlternators aren\u2019t complicated to replace. After disconnecting the battery, remove the serpentine belt and disconnect the wiring on the back of the case. Unbolt the alternator from the mounting location. From here, you can choose to either open it up and rebuild it or replace the alternator with a remanufactured or new part.",

        "title": "What Does the Battery Light Mean?",
        "content": "Why is the battery light on in my car?\n\nFirst things first: if the battery light comes on in your car when you turn it on, you probably have nothing to worry about. Sometimes the battery light will come on when you start your car, but then the light will quickly flick off. If this is the case, pay it no mind.\nSecond, the battery light is probably one of the most misunderstood lights in your vehicle because most people immediately assume it means your battery is bad. While your battery can be bad in some of these cases \u2013 that is not why the light is on. The light is on because your alternator is not properly charging. Initially, in the olden days, this light was referred to as the generator light and often had the abbreviation \u201cGEN\u201d on the light itself. Several made the migration to \u201cALT\u201d but eventually, this light became a little battery icon, or battery word, and the rest is misunderstood history.\nWhat you need to know though is that the battery light does not mean your battery is bad. It does mean, if you don\u2019t attend to it quickly, your battery will die, because your entire car\u2019s electrical system is running off of it.\n\nCan You Drive Your Car With the Battery Light On?\n\nThe short answer to this is, \u201cYes.\u201d The full answer is, \u201cProbably not for too long.\u201d The car\u2019s battery light coming on generally means that there is something preventing your car\u2019s electric system from the battery charged and thus, the car is running on battery power only. Basically, if you see the battery light on in your car when it is running, you shouldn\u2019t expect to be able to drive it for very long. Think of it like unplugging your cell phone from your wall charger. If you leave it plugged in, your phone will last indefinitely on 100% charge. Unplug it, and you\u2019re on battery power. Chances are good that after a day, your phone will be dead.\nThe exact amount of time that your car will be able to function with the battery light on depends on many factors, but assuming that the alternator is the issue (this is the most common issue) it is likely that your car will lose battery power after 30 minutes to an hour of driving. This is about how long it takes most car batteries to completely discharge to a level that the ignition system cannot keep the car running. Of course, this depends on your battery and your car, and some cars may be able to last longer while others may die quicker.\nOther signs of problems with your car\u2019s electrical system may be windows that will not roll up or down if your car has power windows, or a radio that will not turn on. You may also experience problems with the headlights or climate control.\n\nWhat Can I Do if The Battery Light is On?\n\nThe smartest thing to do is to try and get your car home or to a mechanic\u2019s garage as quickly as possible if you see the battery light go on. If you are not in a position where you can do this, the first thing is to ensure that you keep the engine running. Do not turn it off for any reason. If you turn off the engine, it\u2019s likely that you will not be able to start the car again without a jump, and if you\u2019re in an area where you don\u2019t have easy access to mechanics, you probably won\u2019t have easy access to a jump, either.\nYou will also want to make sure that you turn off any features of the car that draw on electricity unnecessarily. This means turning off the air conditioning, stereo, potentially dimming the dome lights, and try not to roll your windows up or down if your car has power windows. If you have any external devices plugged into your car, like cell phones, make sure that they are unplugged. If it is dark, make sure to keep your headlights on for as long as possible, as driving with them off is dangerous.\nUnderstand that driving with the light on can cause issues with your battery in the long run, most notably the rapid discharging can cause your battery to also go bad, and not be able to be recharged. Many customers end up replacing the alternator in the car, don\u2019t properly recharge the battery before installation, then find out the battery also went bad. Just remember that driving on the battery light is limited time. Get the alternator or wiring fixed, and properly recharge the battery at the same time.",

        "title": "Why Is My Check Engine Light On?",
        "content": "Understanding the Check Engine Light\n\nThe Check Engine Light, often abbreviated as CEL, is a critical part of your vehicle\u2019s onboard diagnostics system. It\u2019s essentially your car\u2019s way of communicating with you. When this light illuminates on your dashboard, it\u2019s indicating that the Engine Control Unit (ECU) has detected a problem or irregularity in one or more of the many systems it monitors.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that the Check Engine Light doesn\u2019t pinpoint the exact issue. Instead, it serves as a general warning sign that something is amiss. To get to the root of the problem, you\u2019ll need to perform a diagnostic scan using a code reader to retrieve specific trouble codes. It generally indicates the direction you need to take to get to the bottom of your symptoms.\u00a0\n\nVisit Your Local AutoZone Store for Free Fix Finder Service\n\nVisit an AutoZone Near You!\n\nCommon Reasons for Check Engine Light Activation\n\nThe causes behind a Check Engine Light activation can vary widely, but some common culprits include:\n\n1. Loose or Faulty Gas Cap\n\nYour\u00a0gas cap\u00a0is part of a sealed evaporative emissions system that recirculates gasoline vapors from your gas tank and keeps them from escaping into the air. Because of this, this system of lines and valves is closely monitored, and one of the key sealing pieces of this is the gas cap.\nIf you leave your gas cap off accidentally, it won\u2019t take long before the diagnostic system sets Check Engine Light codes. These leaks in the EVAP emission control system are often grouped as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d leaks. Its important to note that the problem is not always the gas cap, but could be one of the plastic recirculation lines, fittings, or connectors causing the leak, but more often than not, the gas cap is the culprit.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou can lose fuel through evaporation.\nYour recirculation system will not function properly.\nYou will have to stare at the CEL until it\u2019s fixed.\n\n2. Oxygen Sensor Issues\n\nYour\u00a0oxygen sensor\u00a0measures the amount of unburned oxygen in your vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. It indicates how thoroughly the air-fuel mixture burned during the combustion process.Oxygen sensors also live a hard life in +800-degree exhaust temps and are prone to fail over 80,000 miles or more. It\u2019s important to note here that there are a multitude of engine codes where the oxygen sensor indicates something is wrong, not necessarily that the oxygen sensor is bad. Be careful determining that a sensor is truly at fault, as opposed to determining something else is happening. This cannot be more apparent than in the ever-popular\u00a0PO420 / PO421 engine code, which is detailed HERE.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour engine will burn more fuel than needed.\nYou will lose fuel economy, and get fewer miles per gallon.\nFaulty sensor(s) can cause damage to your spark plugs and catalytic converter.\n\n3. Engine Misfires\n\nIf your car is misfiring, you probably aren\u2019t wondering to yourself \u201cWhy is my check engine light on?\u201d Your\u00a0spark plugs\u00a0ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of your vehicle, but if the timing of that spark, the mixture of the fuel and compression of the mixture isn\u2019t perfect, you will get a misfire. Multiple issues can cause a misfire, either on one cylinder or a multiple cylinder misfire.\n\nDefective ignition coil:(either DIS or coil-on-plug). A quick trick to determine if a coil is causing a misfire is to simply move the coil and swap with another on the engine. If you have a #2 misfire and move the #2 coil to cylinder #4, for example, then the misfire moves to #4, you know the coil is suspect.\nDefective fuel injector: If a fuel injector fails to deliver the proper amount of fuel to a cylinder, you will have a misfire. Unlike swapping the ignition coil with a neighboring coil, a fuel injector is more difficult to move.\nVacuum leak:\u00a0Vacuum leaks often cause multiple cylinder misfires, or lean running conditions. They also can be very difficult to diagnose.\nWorn spark plugs and/or wires: Sometimes, spark plugs can go far past their life cycle and fail, causing a misfire. On vehicles with\u00a0spark plug wires, a defective wire or wires can also cause this. For many drivers with older cars, it\u2019s a likely reason the Check Engine Light came on.\nBad compression:\u00a0A burnt or bent valve, worn piston rings, or valve timing that is off will cause a misfire as well. These issues are more serious and will all become apparent during an engine compression test.\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou will experience poor performance (reduced power, engine missing) and reduced fuel economy.\nThe misfire will only get worse, and will lead to mechanical failure in the engine.\n\n4. Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) Troubles\n\nYour\u00a0mass airflow sensor\u00a0(MAF) measures the amount of air entering the engine to determine how much fuel is needed to run your engine properly. If there are any leaks before or after the mass airflow sensor in the intake tract, a light can trigger. Mass airflow sensors are sensitive to oil, dirt, and water vapor, and any contamination on them can trigger a light. Sometimes, cleaning the sensor with intake or mass airflow sensor cleaner can fix the issue. Other times, the sensor needs to simply be replaced. Be sure to check the intake ducting carefully for leaks, rips, or damage.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nA faulty MAF sensor can cause rich or lean conditions, which can lead to further failures of other parts.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\n\n5. Catalytic Converter Issues\n\nYour\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0helps protect our environment by superheating hydrocarbons and other harmful tailpipe emissions into compounds like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Your downstream oxygen sensors carefully monitor the converter\u2019s performance, and if something goes awry, a number of trouble codes based on \u201cCatalyst efficiency\u201d will appear.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a catalytic converter will more than likely not fail on its own. Generally, something causes it to fail or not perform properly. Because of this, simply replacing the converter or the oxygen sensors around it will often not fix the problem, and often leads to yet another failed converter. Things as serious as a blown head gasket can force burned coolant vapor into the exhaust, triggering a catalyst engine code.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour vehicle will not pass an emissions test.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\nWhatever caused the converter to fail initially will continue to get worse, possibly causing engine failure.\n\nInterpreting Check Engine Light Codes\n\nWhen the Check Engine Light comes on, it\u2019s time to connect an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner to your vehicle. This scanner retrieves diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that provide clues about the issue. These codes consist of a letter followed by numbers, such as P0420. The letter indicates the affected system, while the numbers provide further details.\nUnderstanding these codes is crucial to pinpointing the problem accurately. You can consult your vehicle\u2019s service manual or use online resources to interpret the codes. While a specific code might suggest a particular issue, further diagnosis may be needed to confirm the exact problem.\n\nDiagnosing and Addressing Minor Issues\n\nFor minor issues like a loose gas cap or a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, you may be able to address them yourself. In the case of a loose gas cap, simply tightening it can make the light disappear after a few driving cycles.\nReplacing an oxygen sensor or spark plugs can be a DIY project for those with some mechanical know-how. Just be sure to use the right parts and tools and follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nSerious Problems and Check Engine Light\n\nIn some instances, the Check Engine Light can indicate more severe problems. Issues like a failing catalytic converter or a malfunctioning transmission can trigger the light, and diagnosing what\u2019s the root cause isn\u2019t always clear. Attempting to tackle these complex repairs without the necessary skills and equipment can lead to costly mistakes, so you might want to get a professional to weigh in on it.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring the Check Engine Light\n\nIgnoring the Check Engine Light is not a wise choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDecreased fuel efficiency. Many issues that trigger the Check Engine Light can reduce your vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency, costing you more at the pump.\nIncreased emissions. A poorly performing engine can produce higher emissions, contributing to environmental pollution.\nEscalation of problems. What might start as a minor issue can escalate into a major, more expensive problem if left unaddressed.\nSafety concerns. In some cases, the Check Engine Light can illuminate due to safety-related issues, such as a faulty airbag system or braking system. Ignoring these warnings can compromise your safety on the road.\n\nDIY Troubleshooting vs. Professional Assistance\n\nKnowing when to DIY and when to seek professional help is crucial. If you\u2019re comfortable with basic maintenance tasks and the issue seems minor (like a loose gas cap), DIY troubleshooting may be appropriate.\u00a0\nHowever, for more complex issues or if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to consult a qualified mechanic or technician who can accurately diagnose and repair the problem. If you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\n\nTips for Preventing Unnecessary Check Engine Light Activation\n\nWhile not all Check Engine Light activations can be prevented, you can take steps to reduce the likelihood:\n\nRegular maintenance. Follow your vehicle\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule, which includes oil changes, air filter replacements, and spark plug checks.\nTighten the gas cap. After refueling, make sure to tighten the gas cap securely to prevent evaporation of fuel vapors.\nDrive responsibly. Avoid aggressive driving, which can strain your engine and lead to premature wear and tear.\nUse quality fuel. Choose reputable gas stations and use quality fuel to maintain your engine\u2019s health.\n\nThe Check Engine Light is your car\u2019s way of alerting you to potential issues. Understanding its significance, interpreting the codes it generates, and taking appropriate action can save you time, money, and stress in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Test the Alternator and Charging System",
        "content": "What Signs Indicate a Weak Alternator?\n\nCar Battery Light\n\nAn alternator is built to be durable in the toughest conditions including extreme heat under the hood. Internal components are isolated well to prevent wear using high-quality bearings. Unfortunately, certain parts inside the alternator don\u2019t last forever like the brushes made of soft carbon material and the bearings. Corrosion can form that interrupts electrical conductivity, diminishing the alternator\u2019s output.\nSymptoms of a bad alternator can be varied. They include:\u00a0\n\nA battery light on the dashboard. This indicator isn\u2019t for the battery itself but points toward a charging system defect.\nDim or excessively bright lights. An alternator that\u2019s underperforming will often exhibit dim lights while an overcharging condition could make lights brighter than they should be.\nA burning smell. Should the alternator have an electrical issue inside, a burning electrical smell can develop, while a burning rubber smell can pop up if the belt is slipping on the pulley.\n\nCheck out our resource What are the Signs of A Bad Alternator to learn all of the symptoms of a failing alternator.\nKeep in mind that low voltage conditions can cause abnormal electrical operation in today\u2019s highly electronic vehicles. Some otherwise unexplained symptoms could be related to a bad alternator.\n\nHow to Test an Alternator\n\n1. Prepare Your Multimeter\n\nSet your multimeter to voltage and ensure it\u2019s adjusted to 20 DC volts, or if your voltmeter does not have incremental settings (2,20,200,2000) then simply set it to DC volts.\n\n2. Touch the Probes to Your Battery Terminals\n\nDo not start the car yet! \nPress each probe to the correct terminal, touching negative to negative and positive to positive. Your multimeter and battery are probably both color coded, so the negative terminal and probe will be black while the positive terminal and probe are red. \nIf your vehicle has a battery that is tucked away, like under the rear seat or fender well, you will often find jumping or access terminals under the hood, or at least a positive terminal often covered with a large, red plastic protector. If you cannot find a negative lug to touch off to, touching off to any clean bolt that isn\u2019t painted on the chassis or engine compartment will work. \nTake a reading on the battery. You should read between 12.4-12.6 volts. Write down this reading. If it\u2019s below 12.4 volts, check out our article on how your battery could be bad. Now, start the vehicle.\n\n3. Check the Reading\n\nAgain, touch the same location you did when checking the battery. Your charging system should be supplying voltage between 14.0-14.5 in most cases, sometimes higher, but never over 16.5 volts. What you are looking for is a number higher than the initial battery voltage. If the voltage is still only 12.4-12.6 once the engine is running, then the charging system is not functioning. \nIn most cases and in most vehicles, you will have a battery light illuminated that indicates that the alternator is not charging. Contrary to what may seem like a bad battery, an illuminated battery light does NOT mean the battery is bad, it means the battery is not being charged properly. \nVery low differences in voltage between the battery and alternator should also be suspect \u2013 say \u2013 12.8 volts at the battery. The first course of action is to check the wiring carefully that runs between the alternator\u2019s main power wire and the battery. A worn, loose, or damaged connector can cause a massive voltage drop. \n\n4. What if the Alternator Tests Fine?\n\nElectricity is frustrating, or at least it can be. While an alternator can be an expensive piece to purchase, nothing could be more frustrating than buying one only to find out that the one you replaced was fine and another part was the problem. Keep in mind, just because the Alternator tests fine, does not mean the system is fine. \nThe charging system is composed of wiring that not only supplies the battery and system with DC power, it also \u201csenses\u201d the voltage that\u2019s out in the system in order to properly set the voltage leaving the alternator. Couple this sensing wire (known as a field wire) with several other wires, connections, and even fuses and fusible links, and you have a charging circuit that can fail in various spots even if the alternator is perfectly fine. Keep in mind, when you test your charging system while the car is running, or AutoZone does the same, the system voltage is being tested at the battery, and if it\u2019s not getting a charge, the test cannot determine why. \nEither the alternator itself is at fault, or the wiring between it and the battery are. Either case, the alternator will need to be removed, tested, and the wiring and fuses related to the circuit checked as well.\n\nHow to check your car\u2019s starting and charging system to identify any issues.\n\nIf any testing or replacement of your alternator or charging system becomes too difficult of a job, consider visiting one of our Preferred Repair Shops in your area can help you diagnose and repair any faults in the charging system.\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Signs of a Bad Starter - How to Identify Your Starter is Failing",
        "content": "What is a Starter?\n\nTo keep the explanation simple, a starter is essentially a small electrical motor. This motor is powered by the car battery. The one job of this motor is to help get your car up and running. The starter motor is one piece of the starting system in your vehicle. Other pieces or\u00a0parts of the starting system\u00a0include the battery, battery cables, a starter relay, connecting wiring, ignition switch, Transmission Gear Position switch, Clutch Interlock switch (manual transmissions) and in some cases the engine computer. If any of these parts of your starting system are malfunctioning your car won\u2019t start and you won\u2019t be able to get it moving without a tow truck.\n\nBad Starter Symptoms\n\nsigns on when to replace your starter\n\nOf course, there are multiple reasons why your car may not start, and the starter is just one of those potential reasons. Here are some common bad starter symptoms:\n\n1. DASH LIGHTS\n\nThe\u00a0dashboard warning lights\u00a0come on when you try to turn on your car, but the engine does not crank or spin over. This is a classic sign of a bad starter.\n\n2. CLICKING\n\nIf you experience the dreaded \u201cclicking\u201d noise when you try to turn the key, this is a good sign of starter failure. Keep in mind though that even if you do not get the clicking noise and nothing happens when you try to start the car, the issue may still be with the starter.\n\n3. SLOW CRANKING\n\nAnother symptom of a failing starter is an engine that cranks over very slowly, the starter seems to drag or struggle to spin the engine over.\n\n4. SMOKE\n\nSince there are so many electrical components connected to the starter system, if you try to turn on the car and the only result of this is a ton of smoke, you definitely need to put the key down and call a mechanic. This could be a sign of the starter causing the electrical system to overheat.\n\n5. OIL-SOAKED STARTER\n\nYou may also want to take the time to pop open the hood and see if you can locate the starter. Sometimes, the oil system can spring a leak which soaks the starter, leading the starter to malfunction. If this is the case, you may be in for some very expensive repairs. You will likely need to replace the starter, but you will also need to repair the oil leaks to prevent premature failure of your replacement starter.\n\nIf nothing gets your engine started, even a jump start, it is likely that the problem is with your starter. If this is the case, you likely need to go ahead and call a tow truck to get your car to a mechanic, unless you\u2019re comfortable\u00a0replacing your own starter.\n\nStarter Parts\n\nSelect the parts you need, and enter your vehicle\u2019s year, make, model, and engine to find the part that fits.\n\nHow to Start a Car with a Bad Starter\n\nThe reality is that you may not actually be able to start the car at all, depending on the nature of the problem. However, if you suspect that you have a bad starter, the first thing to do is try to\u00a0jump start the car.\nIn order to jump start the car, you need to ensure that both batteries are in good condition (so no leaks and no corrosion) and ensure that anything electronic in both cars is completely turned off. You also need to have a\u00a0set of jumper cables\u00a0and some gloves to protect your hands while you are connecting the batteries together.\nOnce this is done, you can connect the battery in your car to the battery in the functioning car. There should be red cables and black cables marked clearly on the jumper cables. Place the red cables on the positive terminals and the black cables on the negative ones. Make sure that you double check that you have connected the correct jumper cable to the correct battery terminal. Failure to do so can cause very expensive problems in both cars!\nWhen you have ensured that everything is connected correctly, go ahead and start the working car. This causes the non-functioning car to borrow energy from the functioning one. You want to keep the functioning car on for a few minutes so that the non-functioning car has time to borrow the energy.\nOnce this is done, you may be able to start your car.\nIf you are not able to start the car with a jump start, you may want to consider checking the following:\n\nLook at the battery of the car. It is possible that a dead or weak battery is causing your car not to start, rather than a problem with the starter system. A voltmeter can help you check this.\nCarefully inspect the battery cables and connections. The battery cables and connections need to be clean and tight, there should not be any rust or corrosion on the battery cables and all of the connections at the battery and the starter should be tight and secure.\n\nHowever, if you use any of these methods to start the car, it is important to get ready for some DIY repairs or take the car to a mechanic as soon as possible. A starter that is struggling now will fail soon after.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Bad Oxygen Sensor (O2) Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Purpose of Oxygen Sensors\n\nMost vehicles on the road today have internal combustion engines. To generate the power necessary to move the vehicle, the engine burns a precise mixture of fuel and air. This process, of course, creates certain emissions. Both to improve engine efficiency and minimize emissions, vehicles manufactured after 1980 have at least one O2 sensor.\nWith few exceptions, automotive internal-combustion engines require a oxygen-to-gasoline ratio of 14.7:1. If there is not enough oxygen in the mixture, excess fuel sticks around after combustion. Mechanics call this a rich mixture. If the reverse happens, the phenomenon is known as a lean mixture. Both can wreak havoc on your vehicle\u2019s performance and gas mileage. Even worse, the wrong fuel mixture can result in serious engine damage.\nCar manufacturers place oxygen sensors in specific areas to ensure the fuel mixture is neither rich nor lean. The number of sensors in a vehicle, though, differs. Those with V6 and V8 engines typically have three. A car with a four-cylinder engine, on the other hand, may more commonly only have two.\nOperationally, O2 sensors are basic. If the fuel-to-oxygen ratio is off-balance, a chemical reaction creates voltage. This voltage sends information to the vehicle\u2019s\u00a0electronic control module. Thus, if the sensor is not working properly, the computer must guess the amount of fuel that is necessary. If the guess is incorrect, pollution and poor performance may be the result.\n\nSigns of a Faulty or Failing Oxygen Sensor\n\nCommon Check Engine Light Causes: Oxygen Sensor\nAn oxygen sensor does not have to fail completely to give you problems. On the contrary, even a failing O2 sensor (sometimes called a \u201clazy\u201d O2 sensor) may cause your car to have a few issues. If you notice any of the following signs, you may have a bad O2 sensor or one that is about to go bad:\n\nAn illuminated check-engine light\nA rough engine idle\nA misfiring engine\nWorsening fuel economy\nFailed emissions inspection\n\nEven if your car\u2019s engine is not exhibiting any of the above oxygen sensor symptoms, it may still be time to replace your existing ones. In simple terms, O2 sensors are designed to wear out over time. As such, if your vehicle has driven 60,000 to 100,000 miles on with its existing sensors, depending on make and model, you may want to consider replacing its O2 sensors before they fail. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual may specify a service interval you better understand when to preventatively install new sensors.\nThe following parameters may be helpful guideline for when to replace your oxygen sensors:\n\nModel years from the mid-1990s to present day, replace O2 sensors every 100,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s with heated three- and four-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 60,000 to 70,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1970s to early 1990s with unheated one- and two-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 40,000 to 50,000 miles\n\nDiagnostic Procedures\n\nIf you suspect your car has an old, damaged or ineffective oxygen sensor, you can likely either confirm or dispel your suspicions with an OBD-II scanner.\u00a0These scanners plug into your vehicle\u2019s computer and display diagnostic trouble codes. The exact error code for identifying a potentially faulty oxygen sensor, though, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Still, you should be able to glean enough information from the scanner\u2019s readout to determine if you have a sensor-related problem.\nNonetheless, you should realize that other problems may register the same diagnostic code as a faulty oxygen sensor. For example, you may have trouble with your vacuum system. As such, before replacing your O2 sensors, you likely want to inspect your vehicle\u2019s engine for other problems.\n\nReplacement Options\n\nIf you are unable to determine if you have a bad O2 sensor from your OBD-II scanner or a visual inspection, you likely want to take your vehicle to a reliable mechanic. You want to visit someone who has a diagnostic scan tool. This mechanic can tell you with virtual certainty whether you need to replace your O2 sensor. He or she also can likely pinpoint which oxygen sensor has failed.\nWhen it comes to replacing a faulty O2 sensor, you have a couple options. Because sensors are plug-and-play, you may be able to do the replacement yourself. That said, sensors are not always easy to access. Even worse, sometimes the old sensors can seize in place, making them very difficult to remove.\n\nTotal Cost\n\nThe total O2 sensor replacement cost depends on whether you do your job yourself. If you do, you only need to budget for the price replacement sensors, but you will need to clear the codes with an OBD tool (Rent through Loan-A-Tool\u00ae). This price, of course, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Many sensors, nonetheless, cost between $20 and $100. Your mechanic\u2019s labor costs also likely vary based on a few factors, including how difficult it is to access your sensors. Typically, labor costs for a sensor replacement are around $150.\n\nYour Next Step\n\nKeeping your vehicle\u2019s oxygen sensors in tip-top shape is critical. After all, if you have a bad or failing O2 sensor, you could get reduced gas mileage or even fail an emissions inspection.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "How to Replace an Alternator",
        "content": "How to Tell If an Alternator is Bad\n\nThere are some well-established warning signs of a bad alternator. Keep in mind that many failures in the charging system can also be the wiring between the alternator and the battery, but it\u2019s best to always start with the alternator. Because the alternator supplies current to the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems, this is where you\u2019ll notice most that something is amiss.\n\nDead Battery: Your car battery will die without a working alternator to keep it charged. If your battery dies, you should test the battery (free at AutoZone). If the battery is good, then there is likely something wrong with the alternator.\nDim Lights: If you notice your headlights or other lights dimming or flickering, this can indicate that they aren\u2019t getting enough current. Generally, the dimness will worsen as the alternator wears.\nWarning Light: Most cars are equipped with what is otherwise known as the battery light. This light often has a misconception that it means the battery is bad. What it actually means is that the alternator is not properly charging the battery.\nSluggish Accessories: Another possible sign is if electrical accessories or features like power windows move more slowly than they typically do.\n\nTools to Do the Job Right\n\nBefore you get to work, you\u2019ll want to gather all the necessary components. Choose a level, safe work area. In addition to a replacement alternator, you\u2019ll need some tools:\n\nHand tools like ratchets, sockets, and wrenches\nBelt tensioner tool\nGloves and safety gear\nBattery tender or memory saver, if necessary\nJack, jack stands, and wheel chocks, if necessary\n\nHow to Replace Your Alternator\n\n1. Disconnect the Negative Battery Cable\n\nThis step is crucial if you want to avoid a short, and trust us, you do. Before you go about disconnecting the negative cable, consult a vehicle repair manual to determine if a battery maintainer should or should not be used to avoid drivability and/or module re-programming issues. Make sure that the ignition is in the \u2018OFF\u2019 position too. Now, disconnect the negative (ground) battery end and cover it up to avoid making contact during the job. The negative battery terminal is identified with a Minus sign ( \u2013 ).\nNow is a good time to clean, inspect, and test the battery. A weak or failing battery can cause premature failure of the replacement alternator. If you\u2019re not sure how to test it, bring it to AutoZone for a free test.\nIMPORTANT!\nMake sure that the battery is fully charged when this job is completed. Do NOT use the newly installed alternator to \u2018charge up\u2019 a low voltage battery. This can cause damage to the alternator!\n\n2. Locate the Alternator\n\nThe alternator is mounted to the engine, either the front or the side depending on the vehicle. If the alternator must be accessed from underneath the vehicle, a hydraulic jack, jack stands, and wheel chocks will be needed to lift the vehicle and maintain a safe work environment.\n\n3. Inspect Related Components\n\nWhile you\u2019re looking at the alternator, inspect the following related parts of the starting and charging system:\nDrive Belt: This should be changed every 90,000 miles, and while your replacing your alternator is a perfect time to replace this belt if its time is soon to pass. Look out for cracks, frays, and overall wear and tear. A worn drive belt will produce noise and reduce the performance of the alternator. Inspect and replace any additional belts as needed.\nDrive Belt Tensioner: If so equipped, the belt tensioner can be inspected while removing the drive belt. It should feel \u2018smooth\u2019 without \u2018sticking\u2019 or \u2018binding\u2019 as it swings back-&-forth with the belt tensioner tool.  The belt tensioner must not be extremely tight or loose. Also check the alignment of the drive belt and pulley(s). A worn belt pulley (idler) or belt tensioner will cause belt slippage, squalling sounds, uneven belt wear and poor performance of the alternator and the other drive belt accessories such as the power steering pump.\nElectrical Plug Pigtail Connector: Ensure the alternator pigtail and harness are clean and intact.  A loose terminal or damaged pigtail connector can cause electrical and charging problems. Replace all damaged or worn components. Use a small amount of water proof grease (dielectric grease) on the connector and alternator plug-in during installation.\nBattery Terminal B+ Voltage Wire: The alternator 12v battery wire can become worn or damaged over time. If it appears \u2018burned\u2019, has a cracked or melted terminal end, damaged or missing wiring insulation or feels \u2018stiff\u2019, the battery wire should be replaced.  Failure to do so will reduce alternator performance and may even cause an electrical fire.\nContamination on the Alternator like Oil, Grease, or Antifreeze: A small amount of outer surface contamination is normal.  However, if the alternator is covered (soaked) in engine oil or other fluid types, the source of the contamination must be found and repaired.  Contamination can shorten the life expectancy of the alternator and possibly void the manufacturers warranty.\n\n4. Alternator Removal\n\nOnce the electrical connections, drive belt and any interference items are inspected, disconnected and removed, the old alternator can be unbolted from the engine and mounting brackets.\n\n5. Match it Up!\n\nCompare the old alternator to the replacement alternator.  Note the electrical connector plug-in position and the design (shape). Make sure everything matches before installing. This also applies to the position of the alternator mounting bolt holes.\nNOTE: Some alternators will appear different due to consolidation by the manufacture.  Check the installation paperwork that came with the replacement alternator first before assuming you have the incorrect unit.\n\n6. Alternator Installation\n\nCarefully align the working alternator mounting holes and loosely install the mounting bolts and nuts. Ensure all the bolt and/or nut threads are started and tighten them evenly. On some vehicles, the electrical connections will need to be installed first before permanently tightening the alternator for access reasons.\nPlace the drive belt in position and \u2018rotate\u2019 the belt tensioner so the belt can be installed. You may need to refer to the under-hood belt routing diagram or consult the repair guide. You can also check with an associate at your neighborhood AutoZone.\nDue to tight clearances between the pulleys, it is usually best to place the belt onto the pulley(s) that have \u2018a lip\u2019 (usually the grooved type) and slip the belt onto the final pulley without a \u2018lip\u2019 (usually the smooth type). The belt tensioner will only travel (swing) so far which can make installing the belt difficult. Never pry or force the belt onto the pulley. Vehicles with a manual tensioner or the belt tightens with the alternator, there should about \u00bd inch of deflection in the belt between the pulleys with the greatest distance between them.\n\n7. Finishing Up\n\nOnce the alternator, drive belt, and electrical connections are reinstalled, scan the work area and make sure nothing has been overlooked.  Remove all loose items and tools.  Follow the proper steps for the battery maintainer if one was used.\nEnsure the battery posts and battery cable end connections are clean and in good condition. Replace as necessary to ensure tight connections.\nInstall new felt washers on the clean battery posts. Re-attach the battery cable ends to the battery. Positive first, the negative (ground) last.  Apply a film of battery post grease to the top and sides of battery cable ends and battery posts. This will help prevent acid build up and corrosion in the future.\nNow, it\u2019s important to test the alternator\u2019s output. This can be done for free at AutoZone, and can also be done at home with a multimeter. You can learn more on how to properly test here. Place the multimeter probes on the battery terminals. With the car running, you should be seeing somewhere between 13.25 to 15 volts with a fully charged battery. If you are not, and you are only seeing battery standing voltage (around 12.2-12.5) then your alternator is still not properly charging.\nIt\u2019s important to note, this does not mean your brand new alternator is defective! From here, the wiring leading from the alternator, the connections, and possible fusible links must be checked out. Every vehicle\u2019s wiring in this area is slightly different, so consult your repair manual, or online repair source to help.\nAlso, if the job appears to be too big, or you need help troubleshooting, you can contact one of our Preferred Shops in your area, that can help you do the job.\nRemember: the battery should be fully charged. A low voltage battery can damage the replacement alternator.\n\nWith the vehicle level and the final steps completed, start the engine. Listen for odd noises, the smell of burning plastic, or the sight of smoke. You can bring the vehicle to AutoZone and have the alternator tested on the vehicle to ensure the charging system is performing correctly.\nSome of these steps may vary slightly depending on your exact year, make, model, and engine. Always refer to your\u00a0service manual\u00a0to determine the required components and to find the location of your alternator and tensioner.\nNow that you know how to replace an alternator, it\u2019s time to pick up all the\u00a0tools and equipment you need. For the best prices on name-brand alternators, affordable hand tools, and precision replacement parts, visit your local AutoZone.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "What are the Signs of a Bad Alternator?",
        "content": "The Alternator\u2019s Function\n\nThe alternator plays a critical role in the way your vehicle runs. The alternator uses the process of induction to transform mechanical energy into electricity. The alternator\u2019s pulley receives rotational energy from the accessory drive belt, and uses magnetism to generate alternating current, which the alternator then changes intro direct current, which the vehicle can use. With this electricity, the car battery stays charged, powering the vehicle and enabling it to start. The interior lights, headlights, taillights and audio functions of the vehicle work properly thanks to the alternator as well. This part plays such an integral role in your vehicle that its success or failure can have far-reaching consequences on other systems in the car.\n\nWhat are the Symptoms of a Bad Alternator?\n\n1. The Lights Begin To Dim\n\nWhen you get into your car at night and need to find something in the interior, it\u2019s nice to rely on the lights. However, if the brightness of these lights begins to wane, you could have a problem with the alternator. Because this part is connected to all electrical components in the vehicle, the interior lights may begin to suffer as the alternator starts to have problems. The dimness may vary depending on how close to dying the alternator may be. Slight dimness indicates that issues are starting, so it\u2019s a good time to check out the alternator and consider replacing it. You may even notice dashboard lights and displays start to dim and get lighter. Headlights may also appear dim when driving at night due to a failing alternator\n\n2. Warning Light Comes On\n\nIt\u2019s never a good idea to ignore vehicle warning lights, even though some car owners do. Whether it\u2019s a low oil indicator or a service engine soon light, it\u2019s important to address these needs as soon as possible. Many cars will show a light shaped like a battery on the dashboard display or close to the speedometer. While this can sometimes indicate a battery problem, the car\u2019s computer is telling you that the battery is not fully charged, which can also indicate alternator trouble.\nLearn more about why the battery light may be on. \nWith some vehicles, the warning light for the alternator may be an ALT indicator. When the voltage begins to decrease, different accessories will be affected. For example, if you are using your windshield wipers and radio, power from the alternator may not be sufficient to get the headlights on too, as the alternator is already working too hard to power the other systems.\n\n3. Issues with the Belt\n\nIf electrical issues aren\u2019t yet a problem, there could still be other methods for how to tell if alternator is bad. One common cause is a bad belt. Open the hood of your vehicle. If the engine belt is not on correctly or is completely missing, there\u2019s a good chance your alternator is not going to do its job. Some belts may still be in the right spot but may be showing signs of excessive wear, looseness, or there may even be cracks. Replace the belt, and you resolve the alternator\u2019s issues.\n\n4. Unexpected Noises\n\nCar owners are used to hearing strange noises from their vehicles. Different sounds can signify a variety of potential problems. It\u2019s no different with the alternator. Shortly before this part fails, it\u2019s common to hear a growling or whining noise. You may not immediately recognize this sound as a clue that the alternator is going haywire, so it\u2019s important to take the vehicle to a mechanic to investigate the source of strange noises, regardless of what the outcome may be.\n\n5. Flickering Lights\n\nDim lights are usually an obvious clue to people that the alternator is coming to the end of its life. You may not always experience this situation. Instead, the lights may randomly flicker while you\u2019re driving. This is a clue that the following is happening:\n\nThe electrical system is giving out. \nThe electrical system is trying to maintain the correct brightness. \nThe alternator isn\u2019t producing enough power to keep the lights going at full strength.\u202f \n\n6. The Battery Died\n\nMany people have experienced the frustration of finding that their car battery is dead. This ordeal can leave you stranded on the side of the road or somewhere far from home. The fact is, the battery might not be the culprit. You could have a new battery working well one day but failing the next because of the alternator. When the alternator stops working properly, the battery will try to compensate by supplying as much power as possible. The battery is able to provide enough power to start the vehicle, but it may not have enough power for long-term use. If your battery stops working, be sure to test the battery and the charging system rather than assuming other issues aren\u2019t causing the failure.\n\n7. Sluggishness\n\nWhen you open or close the windows or sunroof, or when you\u2019re using the vehicle\u2019s DVD player or stereo, you expect things to work quickly. If it takes longer than usual to perform these functions, the alternator could be the culprit. This would especially be the case if accessories get slower when multiple systems are used simultaneously.\n\nAlternator Resources",

        "title": "How Does an Alternator Work?",
        "content": "What Does an Alternator Do?\nIt may be helpful to think of your vehicle\u2019s alternator as a generator, because that is essentially what it is. In fact, automobiles up to the 1960\u2019s used a generator (which produces electricity but does so differently with different internal parts) and some vehicle manufacturers (many in Europe) still refer to a modern-day alternator as a generator. In simple terms, your car\u2019s engine delivers power to the wheels. The engine also spins the alternator through a\u00a0drive belt, or\u202fserpentine belt, and pulley system. This causes the alternator to create electrical current that is fed back in to the electrical system, and battery.\n\nHow does an Alterntor Work?\n\nThe alternator converts the rotational mechanical energy of the engine into the electrical energy your vehicle\u2019s components need to function. It receives mechanical energy from the\u202fpulley, which is rotated by the engine belt, and uses magnetism to generate alternating current. Furthermore, it changes this alternating current (AC power) into direct current (DC power) that your vehicle can use.\n\nStator:\u00a0The stator is a set of fixed or stationary wire windings. Several of these precisely spaced windings work with the rotor to generate an alternating current.\nRotor:\u00a0The rotor is the part of the alternator that spins. It is supported on both ends with bearings and spins with the assistance of a pulley and drive belt. The rotor features an iron-core center that has a copper wire wrapped around it. Energizing the wire with an electrical current causes a magnetic field with north and south poles to develop.\nBridge Rectifier:\u00a0The bridge rectifier converts the alternating current (AC) from the stator into direct current (DC) that your vehicle can use. To accomplish this task,\u00a0the rectifier has several\u202fdiodes. These diodes allow current to flow in one direction and prevent it from flowing backward. This changes the alternating current into direct current.\nVoltage Regulator:\u00a0The\u202fvoltage regulator\u202fis the nerve center of the entire assembly. It is an electronic component and is responsible for maintaining the charging system voltage within a specified range.\n\nThe Parts of an Alternator\nThe charging system in your vehicle includes the alternator and battery, but there are also other important parts that are essential to the proper operation of the alternator.\u00a0\nHousing\nThe alternator housing will have many holes and will be constructed of aluminum, so it will look silver or grey, if it\u2019s clean. Manufacturers use aluminum because it does not magnetize.\u202f\n\nPulley\nThis is the part that you will see at the front of the alternator, and it will have the serpentine belt running around it. This is what provides the spin to the rotor that generates electricity in the alternator.\n\nStator\nThe stator is the set of copper windings that sits just inside the housing and doesn\u2019t move when the alternator is running.\u202f\u202f\n\nRotor\nThe rotor is the set of copper windings that is attached to the shaft of the alternator and creates the magnetic field when an electrical charge is applied to the windings.\u202f\n\nSlip rings\nThe slip rings are two rings that sit at the end of the rotor shaft and provide a contact point for electricity to travel into the rotor and power the electromagnet.\u202f\n\nBrushes\nThe brushes are spring loaded pieces of metal that contact the slip rings so that electrical current can be transferred to the rotor for the electromagnet.\u202f\n\nBearings\nAt each end of the shaft, there is a bearing that allows the shaft to spin freely.\u202f\n\nRectifier\nThe rectifier converts the alternating current (AC) that your alternator produces to the direct current (DC) that your car needs to run its electrical systems.\u202f\n\nRegulator\nThe regulator measures the voltage that is coming out of the alternator and if it is too high, it will reduce the amount of electricity going to the electromagnet in the rotor, causing the alternator to generate lower voltage. If the output voltage is too low, it will increase the flow of electricity to the rotor, causing the alternator\u2019s output voltage to increase. It keeps the output voltage at between 13 and 14.5 volts.\u202f\n\nFan\nThe fan is located inside the housing and it draws airflow into the alternator to cool the parts and avoid overheating.\u202f\n\nSerpentine Belt\nThe serpentine belt isn\u2019t really part of the alternator, but it is a vital part of the electrical system because it turns the rotor in the alternator to generate electricity. The belt takes its power from a pulley at the bottom of the engine called the serpentine drive pulley or crankshaft pulley.\n\nIdler Pulley\nIdler pulleys are also not actually part of the alternator. They are pulleys bolted to the front of the engine that don\u2019t turn any shafts. They just help to route the serpentine belt to all the important pulleys, so if you trace the travel of your belt, you\u2019ll often see that an idler pulley makes it \u201cturn a corner\u201d.\u202f\n\nTensioner Pulley\nThe tensioner pulley is another important part of the system that isn\u2019t attached to the alternator. You will typically have one tensioner pulley and its job is to keep the serpentine belt running with the correct tension. If the serpentine belt is too loose it can cause some of the accessories to \u201cslip\u201d and not produce enough power. The belt is too tight, you can prematurely wear out the belt. Some Tensioners are spring loaded and others have to be set manually. If you are replacing your serpentine belt, the first step will be to loosen the tensioner pulley.\n\nWhat Causes an Alternator to Go Bad?\n\nMost modern alternators are well-built and can function for a long time. Still, they are not invincible. Eventually, your vehicle\u2019s alternator may require repair or replacement. Typically, when alternators fail, the culprit is one of the following:\n\nBearing failures:\u00a0The alternator\u2019s rotor relies on bearings to keep it spinning freely and smoothly. Like the bearings in other parts of your vehicle, the\u202falternator\u2019s bearings\u202fcan eventually wear out. If this happens, you are apt to hear a loud, grinding noise coming from under your car\u2019s hood. These sounds should get louder as you listen near the alternator, if that is truly the problem. Furthermore, if the alternator\u2019s bearings are well past their prime, the belt may whine, chirp or squeal.\nDamaged regulator or rectifier:\u00a0If your alternator has a damaged regulator or rectifier, you may face a variety of problems. These could include a dead battery, an\u00a0lit battery warning\u00a0or message on the instrument cluster, and dim lights when driving at night. Your vehicle may have an instrument readout that tells you how many volts the alternator is delivering. This should be between 12.3 and 14.4. If your car does not have a voltage gauge, you can use a voltage meter to test alternator output.\nBad belts:\u202fYour alternator needs the pulley and belt system to function optimally. Eventually, drive belts may fray or otherwise wear out. Regularly inspecting the drive belt for signs of wear is a good way to ensure your alternator\u2019s rotor keeps spinning properly.\nWorn Brushes:\u202fThe brushes in the alternator are wear items and eventually they do wear out. This will cause the alternator to not charge properly and can also lead to a dead battery or\u00a0lit CEL\u00a0on the instrument cluster.\nOver Heating:\u00a0Heat is a major cause of failure in alternators. The alternator has vent holes that allow heat to escape and help to prevent overheating. When vent holes are plugged by 60% or more, failure is likely to occur. Also, if the battery does not hold a charge of 12.4 volts or more, the alternator will constantly try to recharge a depleted battery. This constant charging can cause an alternator to overheat.\n\nBecause the consequences can be significant, you do not want to ignore problems with your vehicle\u2019s alternator. After all, if the alternator fails, you may find yourself stranded somewhere you would rather not be. You may also cause additional damage to your vehicle by putting off essential alternator repairs.\nAlternator Maintenance\nIf your it fails, you probably need to replace the alternator. You can, however, take certain steps to keep this part in tip-top shape.\nFirst, keep a good battery under your car\u2019s hood. Because car batteries and alternators go hand-in-hand, you should replace a old, damaged, weak, or ineffective battery. After all, a bad cell inside your battery can ruin your alternator. If you have a vehicle that doesn\u2019t get driven often, consider using a trickle-charger to keep the battery maintained during the down time. The opposite is also true. If you have a failing alternator but a good battery, your battery may disguise alternator performance issues. Eventually, though, both components are likely to require replacement. It is important to note, an alternator should NEVER be used to charge a dead battery. Any time your battery is suspect of being dead, or low on charge, always use a battery charger to complete this task. Charging a dead battery via the alternator will lead to alternator failure. Many times, this is why both failure of the battery AND the alternator can occur within weeks of each other. First, the battery fails. Then, after frequent jump starts and driving around with a dead battery, the battery is replaced, only to find out the new battery goes dead after several days, because the alternator died during this same time. It is a frequent occurrence.\n\nComing Out on Top\nNow that you have answered the question, \u201cWhat does an alternator do?\u201d you likely understand the importance of keeping your alternator in tip-top shape. If you want to come out on top, you cannot leave the health of your vehicle\u2019s alternator to chance. \nBy watching for common problems, you know when to repair or replace your alternator. If something goes wrong, you need high-quality components and the right tools to achieve success. Take a look at your alternator today. If you find a problem and need any parts or tools, stop by your local AutoZone.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Throttle Position Sensor",
        "content": "What Is a Throttle Position Sensor?\n\nThis vital sensor allows your engine to maintain a proper amount of air. This feature is dependent on the throttle valve. When you press down on the gas pedal, your throttle body unit\u2019s valve opens. This causes your throttle position sensor to adjust the engine intake manifold accordingly.\nThis little sensor is essential to a correct mixture of air and fuel. It\u2019s integrated with your engine control module and helps keep your idling and acceleration smooth. When this sensor is damaged or not working properly, it\u2019s important for you to replace it to restore your vehicle to its full performance and power.\n\nSymptoms of a Failed Sensor\n\nThere are many symptoms of a failed throttle position sensor. While some of these symptoms could also be signs of other engine issues, watch out for these symptoms of bad TPS, or throttle position sensor.\nThe most common symptom is your check engine light. This indicator is a vague symptom, as it could also point to a variety of issues, but you can expect to see it if there\u2019s any issue with your throttle position sensor.\nNext, any unusual changes in your acceleration could be linked to this sensor. During your normal driving, consider inspecting your sensor if you experience any of these throttle position sensor symptoms:\n\nHesitations during acceleration\nPoor power\nDifficulty and/or delay in gear shifting\nUnusual surges while accelerating\n\nEach of these could be signs that your throttle position sensor isn\u2019t working correctly. Too much airflow or too little could cause poor acceleration performance, but it could also be linked with other engine issues. If you notice your fuel economy has dropped dramatically, it could be a result of an improper fuel and air mixture.\nSimilarly, if your engine struggles to idle efficiently, it could also be a result of a damaged throttle position sensor. Stalling, surging, or hesitating while idling all can be caused by this unassuming sensor.\nThe best way to determine if these issues are caused by your throttle position sensor is to go to the source. By using a multimeter, you can determine if the sensor has an electrical connection issue. Check the engine control module for the trouble code that resulted in your illuminated check engine light to see if it is linked with your throttle position sensor. These two steps can also help you determine whether you need to repair, replace or reprogram your sensor.\n\nRepair, Reprogram, or Replace Your Sensor\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone through the symptoms of a bad throttle position sensor, it\u2019s time to find a solution. Completely replacing your sensor may be the best way to avoid future issues, but some issues can be easily fixed by reprogramming or repairing your sensor.\nReprogramming or resetting your sensor can sometimes solve these issues. This step can also be necessary when you install a new sensor. The easiest way to reset your throttle position sensor is to unhook the negative cable from your battery for up to five minutes or to remove the fuse for your engine control module. Don\u2019t attempt this if you\u2019re uncomfortable working with electricity, as removing the wrong fuse or cable from your battery could be dangerous. Resetting is sometimes all that is required to restore your sensor. Code errors can cause your throttle position sensor to work erratically or incorrectly. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need professional software to reprogram your sensor. This job is best done by a professional mechanic.\nIf your sensor just needs repairs, it could be the result of faulty or loose wiring. Just like any other electrical wiring, your throttle position sensor is susceptible to corrosion and faulty connections. Once you\u2019ve established the issue is with your sensor and that it isn\u2019t a programming fault, check the wiring and connection points before purchasing a new one.\nFinally, sometimes your sensor is irreparably damaged. A broken sensor needs to be replaced in order to restore full functionality to your vehicle.\nIf your vehicle is having engine issues, it can be difficult to find the culprit. Many different components, including the throttle body system, work together to provide the engine with smooth acceleration. If you\u2019re concerned with the throttle body or are experiencing acceleration and idling issues, review these throttle body symptoms to determine whether your vehicle needs a new throttle position sensor and what you can do to repair, replace or reprogram your sensor.\n\nHowTO\u00a0Replace Your Throttle Position Sensor\n\n1. Removing Your Sensor\n\nFollow these steps to replacing your sensor. First, find the sensor. It should be mounted to your throttle body, which is on top of your engine.\nYou should disconnect your negative battery cable before removing the sensor. This helps you avoid the risk of electrical shock or causing an error code on your engine control module. Your throttle position sensor should be attached using electrical connectors. These connectors are easy to remove using the tab on the side.\nOnce the electrical connectors are removed, look for the mounting screws on your sensor. Carefully unscrew and remove your throttle position sensor. Be sure to read your owner\u2019s manual and compare it with your current sensor when shopping for a new one. Shop at your local auto parts store to find a quality brand or exact OEM match.\n\n2. Installing a New Throttle Position Sensor\n\nInstall your new sensor by working backward through the removal steps. Start by installing the sensor using the mounting screws. Next, connect your sensor to your vehicle\u2019selectrical system using a convenient electrical connector. You should be able to easily push it together and hear a distinct click. Check to ensure a firm connection.\nConnect your battery and prepare to double-check your work. Start your car and test the idle and acceleration. Depending on your vehicle and the sensor you\u2019ve installed, you may need to manually adjust the sensor. Other options automatically adjust to offer your car the optimal levels of air and fuel for a smooth idle and powerful acceleration.\n\nWhether you follow these installation steps or ask your local mechanic to replace your throttle position sensor, looking for these symptoms can vhelp you avoid costly engine repair, poor fuel economy or exponential damage to your vehicle. Inspect your throttle body when you see these symptoms and determine whether you need to reprogram, repair or replace your sensor.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Why is My Brake Light On?",
        "content": "My Brake Light is on, What Do I Do?\n\n1. Start with the Parking Brake\n\nThis depends on when you notice the light. If you first notice the light when you turn on your car, you definitely don\u2019t want to drive it until you figure out what the problem is. The very first thing that you should check is to ensure that the parking brake is completely off. Depending on your car, the warning light for the brake system may be the same as the warning light for the parking brake. This means that if the parking brake is engaged when the car comes on, the brake light automatically comes on to notify the driver.\nThis warning exists because if you drive around with the parking brake engaged, it can cause wear and tear to your brakes\u2019 lining and this can cause them to wear out early.\nSo, the very first thing you should do is if the brake light is on when you turn on your car is to completely disengage the parking brake. If this does not fix the problem, then there is another problem with your braking system and you should not drive the car. (Also, in many newer cars the parking brake warning is distinct from the brake light.)\nIf the brake light came on while you were in the middle of driving, the first thing is not to panic.\nWhat you should do is drive the car to a safe area to park, and then slowly engage your brake to stop the vehicle. Once you have done this, call a tow truck to bring the car to a mechanic or your own garage if you\u2019re the type to work on your own car.\n\n2. Check Your Brake Fluid\n\nThe next thing you should check is what level of brake fluid in the braking system. Oftentimes, the brake light may go on if the fluid is low. If there is low braking fluid in your car\u2019s braking system, most likely there is a leak of some sort. This is a serious problem, because if there is no brake fluid in the hydraulic systems of your brakes, this means that the brakes won\u2019t function.\nA leak in your brakes hydraulic system should be taken very seriously. It is imperative to fix this or take your car to a knowledgeable mechanic quickly.\n\n3. It Might Be the ABS\n\nIf you have checked that the parking brake is entirely disengaged and there appears to be no leak in the brake fluid system, then it is possible that the problem is with your anti-lock braking system (ABS). Again, it depends on the model of your car, but in some cars the brake light comes on to signal an issue with the ABS system. In newer cars, however, it\u2019s likely that there is a dedicated ABS warning light.\n\nWhat Else\u00a0Might it Be?\n\nThe vast majority of the time, the brake light is on because of one of the above three issues. But, there is a less likely chance that the problem could be with a brake sensor. Another possible issue may be with the wiring in the car. That is, the brake light going off can be a symptom of an electrical issue.\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself where all of the warning lights are located on your vehicle. There is no standardization for this, but you can figure out where all the lights are located by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. After you turn on your car, for a split-second all of the warning lights should be illuminated. In that short time before they go off, you want to verify that all of the lights are indeed working. If you see that one of your warning lights is not going on during this check. you may want to get your car\u2019s electrical system checked out.\nWhile nobody likes to see any warning light go on, including the brake light, these lights are designed to prevent you from driving the car is something is wrong. Paying attention to the warning lights can save a life, even yours. These lights may be called \u201cidiot lights\u201d in jest, but they serve a vital purpose.\nMake sure that your braking system is up to date. One of the most important things you need to ensure that you replace regularly are your brake pads. Remember, the efficacy of your\u00a0braking system\u00a0depends on these pads, so make sure that yours aren\u2019t too run down. You can get the parts you need at your local AutoZone Store.

        "title": "What is the Starting and Charging System?",
        "content": "How Vehicle Starting and Charging Works\n\n1. The battery supplies power to your vehicle\n\nThe starting battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The three essential parts for this conversion are the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte.\n\nThe anode is the negatively-charged side of the battery\nThe cathode is the positively-charged side\nThe electrolyte is a buffer that separates the anode and cathode\n\nChemical reactions inside of the battery cause electrons to build up in the anode. Like with magnets, the similarly charged particles repel one another, but in a battery the electrolyte blocks these particles from merely switching sides by moving over to the opposite side.\n\n2. Battery cables and terminals carry current from the battery\n\nBattery cables connect the battery\u2019s terminals to the vehicle. One end of each cable is connected to either the negative or positive terminal.\n\nThe other end of the negative cable is often connected to the engine or somewhere on the vehicle\u2019s frame\nThe positive cable\u2019s other end is typically connected to the starter or a fuse box\n\nBecause the electrolyte keeps the charged particles from crossing the battery, electrical current moves from the battery, through the cables, and into the vehicle.\nCorrosion and loose connections can keep your cables from working the way they should. Be sure to inspect your cables for looseness or corrosion from time to time. If you have a problem, it\u2019s easy to tighten the cables or to remove corrosion with a wire brush.\n\n3. Relays, fuses, and the starter receive electrical current\n\nThe moment you turn the key to start in your car (or push the button) a signal is sent to a relay, or series of relays. The main relay in this group is referred to as the starter solenoid. The signal, coming from the ignition, is low amperage. When it hits these relays, and the starter solenoid, this engages a high-amperage current which directly engages the starter.\nYour vehicle\u2019s relays and fuses regulate current in the electrical systems.\n\nA relay is basically a switch that allows small currents to control accessories that would require heavy switches and wiring. Relays reduce the amount of wiring needed by having larger contact areas that can handle large amounts of current. The starter solenoid is generally one of the largest relays in your car because it handles such a huge amperage amount.\nMany vehicles have fuses in-line in their ignition system as well or a main battery or system fuse. These are often seen mounted either directly on the battery cable, or nearby in the engine\u2019s fuse/relay compartment.\nFuses protect your vehicle\u2019s electronic devices and wiring. If something like, say, your radio tries to draw too much current, the radio\u2019s fuse will blow, cutting off the current\u2019s path to the radio. This prevents the excess current from damaging the radio or melting wires in the system.\n\nAfter reaching the relays and fuses, current continues to the vehicle\u2019s various electrical systems.\n\n4. The starter turns the engine\n\nWhen the starter solenoid engages, the starter\u2019s gear, or \u201cbendix\u201d moves out to engage the flywheel or flexplate of the engine, turning it over. The turning of the engine allows the fuel air-mixture to enter into the engine cylinders for combustion, starting the engine.\nA clicking noise when you turn the key is a good indicator of low battery voltage that is sufficient enough to engage the relays, but not enough to turn the motor. Often times, you will hear a buzzing sound. This sound is your starter solenoid not fully engaging because of low or insufficient voltage. Or, in some cases, a click indicates that your starter has gone bad. In these cases, a visual inspection and/or removal and bench testing is needed, which AutoZone provides. If the starter is soaked with oil contamination and requires replacement, be sure the oil leak is repaired to prevent damage to the replacement starter.\n\n5. The accessory belt or serpentine belt drives the alternator\n\nOnce the engine is turning, rotational force from the crankshaft turns the belt pulley. The belt transfers this rotational force to other systems, like the power steering pump, the water pump, and most importantly for this article: the alternator.\n\n6. The alternator recharges the battery\n\nThe alternator is responsible for 2 things at the same time. It supplies voltage power to everything your car uses while it is running. While doing this, it also sends charge to the battery to maintain its charge as well, and in doing so, the battery acts as a capacitor. An alternator works no different than a windmill or turbine, generating AC power, which is then converted to DC power inside the alternator. The 3 items responsible for this inside the alternator are the rotor, stator, and rectifier. The alternator works similarly, except it is turned by the belt rather than a hand or the wind. The two components responsible for generating electricity are the rotor and the stator:\n\nThe rotor features magnetized finger poles that rotate surrounding the wire field winding. Each finger pole is a different length to produce alternating north and south poles for the winding.\nThe stator is just enough larger that the rotor can spin without touching the stator walls.\nA rectifier is in a sense a valve. It converts AC power (Alternating Current) into DC power (direct current).\n\nThe spinning magnetized poles generate current in the winding, and this current provides the power that charges your battery. Inside your alternator, a voltage regulator makes sure that this voltage is maintained at a proper level for your car\u2019s electrical system. This is usually somewhere between 14-16 volts.\nTest your alternator using an alternator/battery tester or voltmeter (Learn how to test an alternator here). Ensure the drive belt is in good condition and does not slip on the alternator pulley. A dead battery, one that won\u2019t stay charged, or headlamps and interior lights that appear dim can indicate that your alternator is possibly bad. Visually inspect your alternator for signs of the problem. If the alternator is replaced, be sure the battery is fully charged before starting the engine. This will prevent overload and potential damage to the replacement alternator. If the drive belt shows signs of wear, replace it to ensure the alternator will perform properly. If equipped with an automatic belt tensioner, inspect it for wear and binding/sticking. If it does not move smoothly it should be replaced along with the belt.\n\nRemember that AutoZone can help with any of your Battery, Alternator, or charging system needs through replacement parts or testing. If you need additional help, browse through our\u00a0Preferred Shops in your local area\u00a0to help you diagnose and do the job!\n\nOther Parts\u00a0You Can Check:\n\nFuses and fusible links\u00a0protect the circuits in the charging system. A fusible link is a fuse imbedded in a wire.\n\nInspect fuses for breaks or gaps in the wire filament\nTest fusible links using a voltmeter\n\nDashboard warning lights, gauges and LED readouts can provide clues to the source of your problem\n\nMake sure warning lights go off after your car has started\nMake sure the voltage gauge shows a reading of 12 volts when the car is off and rises to 14 volts after it\u2019s started\nPay attention to your Check Engine Light or Message Center Light; They can also indicate a problem\n\nIf you\u2019re working on the system, stop by AutoZone for\u00a0free battery, starter, or alternator testing.*\n*Battery test and charge available only in-store in California.

        "title": "How to Improve Your Interior Car Lights",
        "content": "The Benefits of LED Lights Inside Your Vehicle\n\nGone are the days when you had to deal with stock lighting inside your vehicle. With the advent of LED interior lights, you can upgrade your vehicle\u2019s existing lights. When you do, you are likely to notice some immediate benefits. Here are the pros of LED lights:\nEfficiency: LED lights typically use less energy than their conventional counterparts. Whenever you can conserve energy inside your vehicle, you are sure to notice an improvement. That is, by swapping out traditional lights for an LED alternative, you help your vehicle conserve energy and operate more efficiently.Brightness: LED lights are often brighter than standard ones. As you know, your vehicle has many nooks, curves, and compartments in its interior. When you install LED lights, you increase the overall visibility of the space inside your vehicle. This allows you to see more parts of your car. For finding items in a dark area, upgrading to LED lights likely makes sense.Longevity: Like essentially all types of lightbulbs, the interior lights in your vehicle have a limited lifespan. While LED lights do not last forever, they have a significantly longer useful life than conventional bulbs. In fact, LED bulbs often shine brightly for 15,000 hours.Affordability: The price of LED interior lights has fallen considerably in recent years. If you want to upgrade your car\u2019s existing lights, you are likely to find that LED lights are either about the same price or even more affordable than incandescent ones.\n\nReasons to Install LED Lights\n\nPart of the experience of owning a car, truck or SUV is thinking of ways to turn your stock vehicle into the custom machine of your dreams. While you have thousands of options for upgrading your vehicle, adding LED lights is a popular way to do so. Here are some of the custom reasons to install LED lights in your vehicle\u2019s interior:\nColors: You don\u2019t have to stick to white light when you install LED lights inside your vehicle. Because LEDs come in a seemingly endless number of shades, you can choose the perfect color for accenting the interior of your car.Clarity: If you are not in love with the yellowish hue of your car\u2019s existing interior lights, upgrading to LED lights may be a wise decision. Because LED lights tend to produce bright, white light, you achieve clarity when swapping out incandescent bulbs.Innovation: The sky is the limit when it comes to LED lights inside your vehicle. That is, you do not have to confine lighting to existing spaces. Because LED lights come in a variety of styles, you can stretch light into dark spaces inside your car. You can also install LED lights outside your vehicle to give it an instantly innovative appearance.\n\nSwapping Incandescent Bulbs for LED Lights\n\nWhether you are looking for improved efficiency, better lighting, or a custom enhancement for your vehicle, installing LED lights helps you achieve your goals. If you are wondering how to change interior car lights to LED, the process is likely not as difficult as you may suspect.\nAnywhere inside your vehicle where there are incandescent bulbs is eligible for an LED upgrade. That is, you may want to tackle your vehicle\u2019s dome light, glove box light, trunk light, and other lights. You do not, however, have to replace all incandescent bulbs at once. Instead, you can choose which bulbs to swap out for LED upgrades.\nWhen you are ready to begin your interior car lights project, follow these steps:\n\n5 Steps to Spruce Up Your Interior Lights\n\n1. Locate lights\n\nDepending on your vehicle\u2019s make and model, you may have one or several incandescent lights. To change incandescent bulbs for LED ones, first decide which lights you want to address. For your first project, it may be easiest to begin with the central dome light. This light is likely easy to see and access. \n\n2. Remove bulb cover\n\nMany, although not all, interior lights have a lens or cover to protect the bulb from damage. If the light you want to upgrade to LED has a cover, you must remove it to access the bulb. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual likely tells you how to remove the lens cover. If not, there is a good chance the cover either twists off or simply pops loose. Alternatively, you may need to remove a couple screws to work the bulb cover free. Regardless, you must be careful when detaching the cover to avoid damaging it. \n\n3. Pick an LED bulb\n\nNot every LED bulb fits inside every type of socket. Therefore, you must be sure to choose a compatible bulb when ordering a replacement for your incandescent bulb. The most important part of selecting the correct bulb is the connector. Put simply, you must find a bulb that has a compatible connection.\n\n4. Connect the LED bulb\n\nOnce you have a compatible LED bulb in the correct shade, you are ready to connect it. Bulbs usually have a positive and negative side. After connecting the bulb, test it to ensure it works before reattaching the lens cover. If it does not, try turning the bulb the other direction to be sure you have installed it correctly. \n\n5. Replace the lens cover\n\nAfter you have installed the bulb and checked that it works, you are ready to replace the lens cover. Simply reverse the steps you used to remove it. Before you do, though, clean dust, dirt, and debris from the inside of the lens cover to ensure you do not obscure your new LED light.\n\nGet More From Your Interior Lights",

        "title": "What You Need to Know About OBD",
        "content": "What is OBD?\n\nOn-Board Diagnostics (OBD) is a system that monitors a car\u2019s computer system and reports diagnostic trouble codes. Devices like an OBD-II code reader can read diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) that the system stores when something goes wrong. Typically, at least one code is logged whenever the check engine light is illuminated. That\u2019s how OBD helps mechanics and drivers rapidly diagnose issues with OBD-equipped vehicles.\nThe engine computer, or ECU, uses a microprocessor to read inputs from various engine sensors in real-time, and these readings are used to inform how electronically controlled automatic transmissions, traction control systems, and more react to real world driving situations to create the optimal driving experience. When a reading is outside of the expected values, the system logs a DTC which will be stored to be read through the OBD port.\n\n1. Vehicles from 1981 to 1996 Use OBD-I\n\nOBD-I refers to the first generation of on-board diagnostic systems, which featured proprietary connectors, hardware interfaces, and protocols. If you were a mechanic who wanted diagnostic information back then, you needed different equipment for each vehicle make, or a special OBD-I scan tool that supported multiple protocols and had adapters for each make. Regardless of which route you chose, you needed a lot of tools to work around the many OBD systems.\n\n2. Vehicles from 1994 to Present Use OBD-II\n\nOBD-II is a more standardized version of this system, making it easy to diagnose issues across different vehicles. Before The standardized OBD-II system eliminates the necessity for multiple adapters and scanner accessories. Now most OBD-II systems are nearly the same, but there are five different protocols with slight variations. The system was standardized with specifications from the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) to comply with California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations.\nThese are the five OBD-II protocols:\n\nSAE J1850 PWM: Pulse Width Modulation protocol is used in Ford vehicles\nSAE J1850 VPW: Variable Pulse Width protocol is used in General Motors vehicles\nISO9141-2: All Chrysler and a variety of European or Asian vehicles use this protocol\nISO14230-4 (KWP2000): Keyword Protocol is used in a variety of European and Asian imports as well as Honda, Jeep, Land Rover, Subaru, Mazda, Nissan, and more\nISO 15765 CAN: Controller Area Network is used on all vehicles manufactured after 2008\n\nWhat is an OBD Port and\u00a0Where is It?\n\nThe OBD port is an electrical plug that OBD-II scanners, code readers, and other devices can be plugged into to access the OBD-II system. It is also the port that is typically used for state vehicle inspections. This port is typically located near or under the steering wheel column, although it is sometimes located near the center of the dash or center console, or under the glove box. If you\u2019re having trouble finding it, check your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nDiagnostic\u00a0Trouble Codes\n\nWhen a code reader is connected to the port, it is capable of reading the\u00a0diagnostic trouble codes\u00a0that are stored in the system. DTCs typically start with a letter to indicate the system affected followed by five digits to specify the issue. There are codes for the powertrain, body, chassis, and network:\nPowertrain codes begin with a P_____. Codes that begin P1____ are manufacturer specific, meaning they will indicate different things depending on the makeBody codes begin with a B_____Chassis codes begin with a C_____Network codes begin with a U_____\nSome code readers will figure out what the code means for you, but if you just get the code, you may need to look up exactly what it means.\n\nOBD for Performance and More\n\nOBD was made for diagnostics, but it is also heavily used in tuner circles by those who are looking to get better performance out of their rides. \nThe system uses your vehicle\u2019s sensors to determine whether something has gone wrong, but some sensors can even read real-time information from the sensors. Some companies even make dongles for the purpose of monitoring a vehicle\u2019s system, whether for tuning or keeping tabs on a young driver\u2019s speeds. There are also performance tuners, which connect to the OBD port and can remap the vehicle\u2019s software to increase power output among other things.\nOften, performance gains from OBD come at the expense of other qualities, like fuel economy and reliability.\n\nWhat is an\u00a0OBD-II Scanner?\n\nOBD-II scanners are the tools that are used to read DTCs. The two most common types are:\nCode Readers are basic devices that can read and clear codes from any OBD-II equipped vehicle. They are limited by the fact that while they can read codes, they typically provide no additional information, meaning they lack information on manufacturer-specific codes.Scan Tools are more expensive and more versatile. They offer more troubleshooting information, can be used to diagnose manufacturer-specific codes, and can access live and recorded data.\nThere are many different scanners in these two types. While a scanner is definitely a useful tool for anyone working on cars built from 1996 on, not everyone needs the best scanner around. Some are capable of running an emissions test or other automated tests, some can read OBD-I and OBD-II, and some are dongles that wirelessly connect to a smart phone or computer. Consider what you need from a scanner and get one that meets your needs.\n\nTroubleshoot With\u00a0Fix Finder\n\nFix Finder reads diagnostic trouble codes from your vehicle\u2019s onboard diagnostic system, and pulls your vehicle information and mileage.This data is analyzed to give you vehicle-specific fix solutions that have been verified from the records of over 5.5 million ASE-Certified technicians.AutoZone gives you a FREE, easy-to-read MYZONE HEALTH REPORT, which includes relevant codes, and details the action that needs to be taken.\nYou can get the parts you need at your local AutoZone Store.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "How To Tell If Your Mass Air Flow Sensor Is Bad",
        "content": "How the MAF sensor works\n\nMAF sensors are located between the air filter and the throttle body and are responsible for measuring the amount of air entering the engine.\nMost vehicles have a hot wire MAF sensor. It has one heated wire and one ambient temperature wire. The microprocessor inside the MAF sensor measures the air entering the engine by maintaining the temperature of the hot wire 200\u00b0F above the ambient incoming air. The energy required to maintain the sensor at the same temperature is calculated and sent to the powertrain control module (PCM). The PCM then controls the injectors to deliver the specific amount of fuel that\u2019s proportional to the airflow, creating an air fuel mixture that, ideally, is perfect for your engine.\n\n3 SYMPTOMS OF A BAD MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR\n\n1. YOUR CAR HESITATES OR SUDDENLY JERKS FORWARD WHILE ACCELERATING\n\nA bad MAF sensor can cause your vehicle to experience poor drivability issues such as engine stalling, jerking or hesitation during acceleration. This could happen while speeding up on the highway on-ramp or cruising down a city street. These issues can create dangerous situations causing accidents and injury. If you experience any of these symptoms you should examine your vehicle as soon as possible.\n\n2. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO RICH\n\nYour vehicle needs the proper ratio of fuel to air in each combustion cylinder. Running rich means there is too much fuel and not enough air. Signs that your vehicle is running rich include:\n\nBlack smoke exiting the tailpipe\nWorse fuel efficiency than usual\nRough idling\nCheck Engine Light\n\n3. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO LEAN\n\nRunning lean is the opposite of running rich. It means your vehicle has too little fuel and too much air. Similar to running rich, the MAF sensor is sending inaccurate information to the PCM. This time underestimating the amount of airflow instead of overestimating it.\nAlthough this will temporarily improve your fuel efficiency, running lean for too long can seriously damage your vehicle. You may experience:\n\nEngine hesitation and/or surging\nHard engine seizures\nHard starting\nCheck Engine Light\n\nAs with other MAF sensor problems, the solution may be as simple as cleaning the wires. However, it\u2019s also a good idea to have a mechanic check your vehicle for damage.\n\n4. YOUR OBD-II SCANNER GETS\u00a0CODE P0101\n\nIf your\u00a0Check Engine Light is on, use a code reader to see what diagnostic trouble codes the system puts your way. If you don\u2019t have a code reader, stop by AutoZone to use our free Fix Finder program.\nThis Code\u2019s full read out is: P0101 \u2013 Mass Air Flow Sensor Circuit Range/Performance.\nThe engine computer uses the MAF sensor signal to determine how much fuel needs to be injected to meet the proper air-fuel ratio. The MAF sensor signal is also used to calculate engine load, meaning it can cause trouble for the traction control system, or change the automatic shifting pattern in applicable vehicles. This code is most commonly caused by a dirty, obstructed, or faulty MAF sensor, but can also be caused by issues including:\n\nDamage to the intake boot\nVacuum leaks\nClogged or improperly installed engine air filter\nClogged-up cat converter or restricted exhaust\n\nBecause there are other potential causes besides the bad MAF sensor, it\u2019s worth looking into these other possibilities so you are positive this code is being caused by the sensor before you go about replacing it.\n\nA malfunctioning MAF sensor may cause your vehicle to jerk during acceleration, run too rich, or run too lean. Make sure to fix the problem right away so you can be safe, avoid costly repairs, save money at the pump, and avoid being stranded on the road. Be sure to take a look at the mass air flow sensor before replacing it, you may only need to clean your MAF. Stop by your local AutoZone for advice on symptoms of a bad MAF sensor.\n\nShop MAF Sensors",

        "title": "How to Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "HOW TO CHANGE SPARK PLUGS\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and ensure the engine is cool. Clean the engine area of any dirt and debris to prevent anything from falling into the engine cylinder during spark plug replacement. Additionally, you may want to disconnect the battery (negative post only). Check the vehicle repair guide or other resources to ensure no damage will occur if the battery is disconnected for any length of time or if any modules or other items would need to be reprogrammed. Ensure the positive and negative terminals do not become crossed with a foreign object such a hand ratchet and cause a dangerous short circuit.\n\n2. REMOVE THE SPARK PLUG WIRE\n\nFirst, remove any interference items. If your vehicle requires removal of the upper intake plenum, a new gasket will be needed. After gaining access, you will likely find the rubber spark plug wire end and inside metal terminal somewhat difficult to remove from the spark plug. You must be careful to avoid damaging the rubber boot or tearing the wire terminal away from the plug wire end. If you discover the plug wire boot is \u2018stuck\u2019 to the spark plug try using spark plug wire pliers to aid in removal. The boot may need to be twisted back and forth to break the bond from the spark plug. Again, be careful. The metal terminal that connects to the spark plug inside the boot must be removed simultaneously with the boot to avoid damage. If damage to the boot or wire occurs, don\u2019t feel bad. In many instances, even a professional is unable to remove them without damage occurring. If damage does occur, the wire(s) must be replaced. Re-installing a damaged boot or wire will cause a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the spark plug wires are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. A new plug wireset will ensure the newly installed spark plugs will receive all the necessary firepower from the ignition coil(s).\n\n3. REMOVE THE COIL ON PLUG (COP)\n\nCOP designed coils attach directly to the spark plug end and use a long rubber insulator boot. Start the removal process by disconnecting the electrical connector from the ignition coil. Press down or pull up on the locking tab to make the connector release so it can be disconnected. A small screwdriver may be needed to help depress the locking tab. Once the connector is off, remove the hold down bolt and carefully twist the coil about a quarter turn or so back and forth until the \u2018bond\u2019 is broken. Then it should pull straight up and out. Use caution! There is always a risk of damage to the COP boot. COP coils and their insulator boots are made of plastic and rubber that protect and insulate the high voltage conducting materials inside. Damage will cause the high voltage to leak (short) to ground causing a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the boots are damaged they must be replaced. Just like spark plug wires, if they are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. Check the COP boots for signs of engine oil or engine anti-freeze contamination. Oil puddled in the spark plug well hole is usually caused by a valve cover tube seal and/or leaking O-ring. The appearance of coolant in the plug well can be caused by a leaking heater or by-pass hose or even the intake manifold gasket. These leaks should be repaired first, especially if severe, to prevent damage to the new components.\n\n4. UNSCREW THE SPARK PLUG\n\nBe sure the engine is cooled off. Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs. Avoid thread damage by following these suggested steps. On COP applications remove debris by blowing air down into the spark plug well hole. Even the tiniest of particles can build up in the threads of the spark plug during removal and cause damage to the cylinder head threads. If this occurs, sometimes a spark plug thread restorer tool may be used to do just that, restore damaged threads in the cylinder head. Next, loosen/turn the spark plug about a half a turn counter-clockwise and blast a small shot of penetrant fluid to the base/ thread area of the spark plug. Allow a few minutes to soak. On some engines, the manufacture may provide additional removal steps. Check the repair guide. Take note it you feel considerable resistance while turning the spark plug counter-clockwise. You may need an additional small amount of penetrant and soaking time. If you encounter resistance, turn the spark plug clockwise and carefully work it back and forth. If the plug just won\u2019t co-operate, you should probably stop and seek a professional\u2019s help. Damaged cylinder head threads can often be expensive to repair, depending on your vehicle.\n\n5. PUT IN THE NEW SPARK PLUGS\n\n6. RE-INSTALL THE SPARK PLUG WIRES OR IGNITION COILS (COP)\n\nApply a small amount of plug wire grease to the plug wire boot (or COP boot) and re-install each plug wire or ignition coil. Be sure and connect the plug wires to the appropriate spark plug for each engine cylinder (refer to a firing order diagram if necessary). Re-install the coil hold down bolt(s). Re-attach the electrical connector(s). Re-install all other components removed to gain access. Be sure and gather up all tools and the engine is free and clear to start. Remember to re-connect the battery if it was disconnected at the beginning.\n\n7. START UP THE ENGINE\n\nStarting the engine after the spark plug replacement is a good way to validate your work. Note: If your Check Engine Light is on, you can drive your vehicle to your local AutoZone store and have the code translated. If the Check Engine Light \u2018flashes\u2019 there is a cylinder miss-fire. Re-check your work. Do not drive the vehicle very far if the engine is missing as the\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0could be damaged.\nYou may need to\u00a0gap your spark plugs\u00a0before installing them. Some plugs come pre-gapped, and if this is the case it will say so on the box. Otherwise you\u2019ll need a gap tool to gap your new plugs according to the specifications in your owner\u2019s manual. Most modern cars use plugs made from long-lasting materials, so you might only need to do a spark plug replacement once or twice over the time you own a vehicle.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "What Does a Distributor Do on a Car?",
        "content": "What is a Distributor and How Does It Work?\n\nWhat is a distributor? In the overall picture of an engine\u2019s operation, the distributor ties into the combustion process by regulating the precise timing of spark delivery. It\u2019s very closely connected to the ignition coil and the spark plugs, ensuring that the air-fuel mixture ignites at the precise point in the engine\u2019s cycles.engine\nAt its core, a distributor is a device that works on both the mechanical and electrical spectrums. It distributes high voltage from the ignition coil to the engine\u2019s cylinders in the correct firing order. Components of a distributor include:\n\nA rotating arm with the camshaft gear on it, connecting the distributor firmly to the camshaft.\u00a0\nA rotor that passes current from the ignition coil to the individual contacts within the distributor cap.\nThe distributor cap that houses the rotor, terminals for each spark plug wire, and on some older models, a set of points.\nPoints, or contact points, that act as a switch in the distributor to control the flow of high-voltage current.\nIgnition wires that transfer the high-voltage jolt of energy from the distributor to the spark plugs.\n\nThe Distributor\u2019s Role in Ignition Timing\n\nA spark plug must ignite the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder at a very specific moment in the compression stroke, and the distributor helps ensure it happens exactly as it should. The distributor\u2019s timing is set mechanically according to the camshaft gear as it meshes with the camshaft, but there\u2019s more fine-tuning possible. Often, a set screw can be loosened and the distributor rotated slightly to ensure the timing is precise at idle.\nHowever, under acceleration or at other points in an engine\u2019s operation, the timing may need to be adjusted too. A vacuum advance mechanism is often incorporated, adjusting the timing in response to different engine loads.\nIf the distributor\u2019s timing isn\u2019t set properly or if it doesn\u2019t adjust as it\u2019s meant to, there can be consequences ranging from minor to quite severe.\n\nIf the spark occurs too early, it can cause knocking or pinging along with a reduction in the power the engine produces.\nIf the spark occurs too late, the engine can lack power and burn more fuel because the combustion process isn\u2019t as clean, and excessive emissions are often a symptom too.\n\nLeft uncorrected, a poorly adjusted or damaged distributor \u2013 or even a worn-out cap and rotor \u2013 can cause your spark plugs to quickly foul, make your engine hard to start or contribute to stalling and stumbling, the catalytic converter can overheat and become damaged, and there can be other symptoms like bad exhaust smells and backfiring.\n\nDistributor Maintenance Tips\n\nLike many systems on older cars, there\u2019s more maintenance required for distributors than you\u2019d have on a newer, distributor-less model. It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll run into issues from time to time too. You might notice:\n\nA rough run that comes and goes. You may have an issue with the engine vacuum advance control for the distributor, or it could be that the set screw is loose and your timing is moving slightly.\nLack of power that keeps getting worse. Carbon can build up on the inner contacts inside the distributor, or the points may be worn out.\nThe engine bogs on acceleration. The points may be set incorrectly, or the timing may need to be adjusted.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to keep your vehicle well maintained if you have a distributor ignition system, and that includes semi-annual or annual inspections. Check that there aren\u2019t any cracks in the distributor cap, and inspect for moisture under the cap. Clean any dust and corrosion that have built up, especially on the contacts under the cap, since it can lead to arcing that decreases the spark transfer\u2019s efficiency. Replace the cap, rotor, and points (if equipped) when the contacts are showing signs of wear.\nAs well, it doesn\u2019t hurt to check your engine timing annually and fine-tune the adjustment to ensure you\u2019re getting the most powerful and efficient performance possible from your engine.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Why Does My Engine Sound Loud When Accelerating",
        "content": "Understanding Engine Noise during Acceleration\n\nWhen you push the pedal and your engine responds with a rising note, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s creating the sound you hear. Acceleration requires your engine to burn more fuel and air, generating higher energy levels. When you demand this power increase, the internal components of your engine can produce various sounds, often becoming more pronounced. Additionally, factors like the type of engine such as inline, V-shaped, boxer, and so on, the number of cylinders, and the design of the exhaust system can influence the nature of these sounds.\nEngine noises can vary dramatically. Some might be high-pitched whining, while others can be low rumbles. A motorcycle-like sound often means your engine is working hard and that the exhaust system might not be properly sealed. Common types of engine noise you might encounter during acceleration include:\n\nKnocking or pinging \u2013 This is a high-frequency rattling noise that often signals the fuel in your engine isn\u2019t burning evenly or at the right time, potentially damaging critical components.\nRoaring \u2013 These can be symptomatic of exhaust issues, like leaks or problems with the resonator, a part of the muffler designed to reduce noise.\nTapping, clicking, or ticking \u2013 This noise, which tends to be more rhythmic, can result from lack of oil, issues with the valvetrain, or even problems in the engine\u2019s rotating parts.\n\nCommon Causes of Loud Engine Sounds\n\nThere are several common culprits when it comes to a noisy engine during acceleration. And within each category, there can be multiple causes.\n\nExhaust System Issues\n\nThe exhaust system manages gases from the combustion cycle and muffles the noise your engine makes. When this system is compromised, you get loud engine sounds. It could be from:\n\nExhaust leaks \u2013 A hole in the exhaust system such as a muffler or exhaust pipe or a leak in places like the exhaust manifold can cause a significant increase in noise.\nCatalytic Converter Failure \u2013\u00a0 One of the components for treating exhaust gases, a failing catalytic converter can lead to a louder engine.\n\nEngine Misfires\n\nThese are instances when the air-fuel mixture fails to burn as it should, creating imbalances and vibrations:\n\nFuel injection system issues \u2013 A fuel injector that\u2019s clogged or malfunctioning can lead to too little or too much fuel being delivered to the cylinder, causing misfires.\nIgnition problems \u2013 A weak spark, malfunctioning spark plug, or ignition coil can result in the fuel not being ignited properly.\n\nWorn or Faulty Components\n\nOver time, the wear and tear on engine components can lead to increased noise levels:\n\nPiston slap \u2013 This occurs when the piston rocks back and forth in the cylinder, causing a metallic sound as it contacts the cylinder wall.\nWorn bearings \u2013 Bearings support the rotating shafts in your engine and can produce a knocking noise when they\u2019re worn out.\n\nImpact of Acceleration on Engine Performance\n\nUnderstanding the effects of acceleration on your engine\u2019s health is essential to long-term vehicle maintenance. Sudden acceleration can place a considerable strain on several internal components. The faster your engine operates, the more valves, pistons, and other moving metal parts move, which can lead to increased wear. Turbochargers can further exacerbate the issue, as the turbo spools up to provide more power, increasing pressure and heat.\nAggressive driving can severely hamper your fuel economy. The faster you accelerate, the more fuel your engine will consume. But there are ways to balance power and efficiency, even during acceleration. Gradually increasing your speed puts less strain on your engine and can save fuel, and keeping your engine in good shape can ensure that no harm is done, even during acceleration.\n\nDiagnosing and Resolving Engine Noise\n\nNow that you understand the factors at play, it\u2019s time to get to the bottom of the issue, starting with some do-it-yourself methods.\nIf your engine is causing noise, these simple checks can often reveal the source:\n\nPerform a visual inspection of your exhaust system, looking for holes, rust, or other indicators of damage.\nEnsure that your spark plugs are clean and not worn, and that the ignition cables and connections are secure.\nA stethoscope can be a handy tool to isolate the source of the noise, whether it\u2019s a pulley, water pump, or another accessory.\n\nIf the issue isn\u2019t readily apparent or you\u2019re uncomfortable diagnosing the problem yourself, don\u2019t hesitate to seek help from a professional. A qualified mechanic can provide a more thorough inspection, using diagnostic tools and methods that might be beyond your scope.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Replace Your Intake Manifold Gasket",
        "content": "Introduction to Intake Manifold Gasket Replacement\n\nThe intake manifold gasket seals the intake manifold to the engine\u2019s cylinder heads. It\u2019s vital for maintaining intake manifold vacuum, ensuring that the pressures your engine requires for operation are maintained. It also seals channels for fluids, typically engine coolant, as it crosses between different topside components.\nIf you notice any of the following symptoms, there\u2019s a possibility your intake manifold gasket needs replacing:\n\nEngine overheating\nCoolant leaks from the top of the engine\nWorsening engine performance\nA rough idle\nCheck Engine light on\n\nTools and Parts You\u2019ll Need\n\nBefore you start, gather all the tools and replacement parts needed for the job.

        "title": "How to Clean a MAP Sensor",
        "content": "Understanding the MAP Sensor\n\nThe MAP sensor monitors the pressure in the intake manifold, providing data on engine load to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). This information is vital for the ECU to adjust fuel injection, ignition timing, and turbocharger boost levels. A silicon chip or wafer in the sensor flexes a different amount based on the pressure in the intake manifold, and the amount of flex is converted into a resistance reading that the ECU can understand.\nA dirty MAP sensor can lead to several performance issues, including poor fuel economy, rough idling, engine surges, and even stalling. The Check Engine light also illuminates, and if you\u2019ve completed a scan, you might see codes referring to MAP or Baro Pressure. If your vehicle has any one or a combination of these symptoms, the MAP sensor may be the culprit.\n\nTools and Materials Needed\n\nTo clean your MAP sensor, you will need:\n\nA set of screwdrivers\nA soft-bristled brush or Q-tips\nElectrical contact or MAF sensor cleaner\n\nNever use carburetor or brake cleaners, as they can damage the sensor.\nAlthough the task is straightforward, always work in a well-ventilated area when handling cleaning solvents to prevent inhalation of fumes. Also, ensure the engine is completely cold before starting to work on it.\n\nStep-by-Step Cleaning Guide\n\nBefore working on the MAP sensor, have your tools ready and have a clean work area. Disconnect the battery to prevent electric shock or ana accidental short circuit.\n\nStep 1: Locate the MAP Sensor\n\nThe location of the MAP sensor can vary depending on the engine type and model of your vehicle. Typically, it is mounted on or in the intake manifold or throttle body. Refer to your vehicle\u2019s service manual for the specific location if you can\u2019t identify it confidently.\n\nStep 2: Remove the MAP Sensor\n\nYou might need to remove the engine cover or other components for clear access to the MAP sensor. Be gentle, especially with plastic parts, to avoid breaking something.\nCarefully unplug the electrical connector. Then, remove any fasteners holding the sensor in place. Wiggle the sensor to loosen it, and then pull it out gently.\n\nStep 3: Clean the Sensor\n\nHold the sensor facing down to prevent debris from falling into it. Use the sensor cleaner to spray the inside and outside of the sensor until it\u2019s free from dirt. Do not physically touch the sensor, and avoid using compressed air as it can be too aggressive and damage the chip.\nIt\u2019s important to use a cleaner specifically designed for MAP sensors. These cleaners are safe to use and do not leave any residue. Follow the instructions on the cleaner\u2019s label for the best results.\n\nStep 4: Re-Install the MAP Sensor\n\nInstall the sensor in its place in the same position as before you removed it, then fasten it. Connect the electrical harness, ensuring it\u2019s fully seated and clipped.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nWhen cleaning a part like the MAP sensor, it\u2019s easy to focus solely on it. Avoid this mistake by checking and potentially cleaning connected components, such as the intake duct and throttle body, to ensure an optimized cleaning routine.\nUsing anything other than the recommended cleaner can damage the sensor. Carburetor and brake cleaners are too strong and can leave residue that impacts the sensor\u2019s operation.\n\nTesting Your Cleaned MAP Sensor\n\nAfter cleaning and re-installing the MAP sensor, clear any error codes and take your vehicle for a test drive. Pay attention to the symptoms you were experiencing, and note if they have improved.\nIf the problem still persists, it might indicate the sensor is beyond cleaning and needs to be replaced, or there may be another problem causing it like rubbed-through wires or loose pins in the connector. It\u2019s a good practice to inspect all the vacuum hoses connected to the MAP sensor for leaks or blockages.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Engine Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Factors Influencing Engine Replacement Costs\n\nThe overall cost to replace an engine can vary greatly, as mentioned. It\u2019s not simply a matter of purchasing a new engine. Several variables can either increase or decrease the price. Labor, for instance, can range widely depending on where you live, the mechanics\u2019 qualifications, and the amount of time required to complete the installation.\nThe make and model of your vehicle will significantly affect the engine replacement cost, and is perhaps the most important factor. A common model with readily available parts might have lower costs, while luxury or exotic vehicles can demand a high price not only for the engine itself but also for specialized labor.\nAmong the factors is warranty also. An engine that comes with a year of warranty will tend to be less expensive than one with three, five, or even six years of coverage against mechanical failure.\n\nTypes of Engine Replacements\n\nA new engine will often be the most expensive option, while remanufactured engines can offer a more cost-effective yet reliable alternative. When you buy new, you\u2019re getting an engine that\u2019s never been run previously with all new components inside. There\u2019s no chance of wear and tear that\u2019s already set in. Essentially, you\u2019ll have the same engine as your vehicle would come with from the factory, and perhaps with minor upgrades for flaws that have been noticed since it was originally produced.\nA remanufactured engine has been rebuilt to OEM specifications with any worn or damaged parts replaced before being tested to ensure it meets certain performance standards. There will be components that have been reused and/or refurbished inside it, including the engine block and cylinder heads in most cases. It\u2019s typically just as reliable as a new engine, often with similar warranty coverages, but the costs are lower.\nYou may opt for high-performance engines or official OEM versions, which can impact the price. These engines are typically more expensive due to the additional performance features or because they are brand-specific. What you can also expect is that any performance upgrades resulting in more power will be more expensive too.\n\nEstimating Replacement Costs\n\nFor the mechanically inclined, a DIY engine replacement might seem like a good way to save on labor costs. However, this task requires the right tools, significant technical knowledge, and an abundance of time. It\u2019s possible to install a new engine on your own, but the decision to do so shouldn\u2019t be made lightly.\nOn the other hand, professional installation ensures that the job is done correctly and typically comes with a warranty, offering peace of mind despite the higher initial output. The trade-off is certainly the cost, which could run anywhere from $1,000 to more than $3,000 depending on the vehicle, and modern vehicles are more complex and costlier to repair than older cars.\n\nTips for Budgeting Engine Replacement\n\nUnexpected expenses can arise during engine replacement. It\u2019s wise to add an additional 15 to 20 percent to your budget as a contingency to cover anything unforeseen.\nSome auto repair shops offer financing options to help you afford engine replacement without paying all at once, and you may be able to do the same for the parts you purchase online with monthly instalments.\n\nChoosing the Right Replacement Parts\n\nThere\u2019s often a choice between OEM parts and aftermarket components. While OEM parts assure a certain level of quality and assurance of fit, aftermarket parts can be less expensive. When you choose brand name aftermarket components, you often get options for the same quality as the original,\u00a0 or even better. The decision should depend on the quality, availability, warranty, and your own comfort with the parts\u2019 origin.\nRegardless of the source, you should always aim for high-quality replacement parts to ensure they\u2019re made to last and keep your car performing at its best.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetermining the engine replacement cost is complex and influenced by many factors, from the type of engine you choose to the associated labor costs. It could range from a total of $3,000 to $8,000 or even more when you have a mechanic do the work, and even changing the engine on your own will likely cost $2,000 or more using the most frugal options.\nWhether you decide to go with a new or remanufactured engine, opt for professional installation, or choose OEM over aftermarket components, being informed will help you make decisions that provide the best balance of cost, reliability, and performance for your vehicle.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Are Engine Block Heaters?",
        "content": "Introduction to Engine Block Heaters\n\nThe purpose of engine block heaters is straightforward: to warm the engine of a vehicle before starting it, particularly in cold weather. As the temperature drops, the tolerances between parts inside the engine shrink as the metal contracts, and more effort is needed to overcome the friction. Add to that, engine oil becomes much less fluid in the cold, and the resistance it creates against moving parts adds even more strain on the starter.\nA brief glimpse into the history and evolution of engine block heating technology reveals that these devices first came into use in colder regions, where starting a car in sub-zero temperatures was often a herculean task. Aircraft first used them, and a head bolt heater was introduced in the late 1940s. It has since evolved to the iterations we see today. Over time, as engine designs changed and technology advanced, so too did the design and functionality of engine block heaters.\n\nHow Do Engine Block Heaters Work?\n\nTo appreciate the mechanics behind engine block heaters, it\u2019s beneficial to understand their operation. These devices warm up the engine oil or coolant, depending on the type of block heater, promoting easier and quicker starts by improving fuel combustion, thus minimizing wear on the engine\u2019s components.\nWhen the block heater is plugged in, the heat it generates warms the engine including the fluids, mitigating some of the added resistance that the cold creates. It uses normal 110-volt household power, and the heating element in the block heater warms the engine substantially. Many block heaters today include a thermostat inline in the cord so that it only operates when the temperature is at or below 0 Fahrenheit. This saves energy, especially since using the block heater above that temperature can fool sensors into thinking the engine is warmer than it is, actually impeding the starting process.\nThere are various types of engine block heaters available in the market, each with its unique method of heating the engine. Some of the most commonly used types include:\n\nFreeze plug heaters \u2013 Installed in a freeze plug opening on the side of the engine block, these heaters warm up the coolant.\nMagnetic heaters \u2013 Sitting on the exterior of the oil pan, they use magnets to keep the heater in place and heat up the oil.\nDipstick heaters \u2013 These are placed directly into the engine\u2019s oil pan, providing heat to the oil.\u00a0\nInline coolant heaters \u2013 Fitted inside a coolant hose, these heaters warm and circulate engine coolant for a more consistent temperature increase.\n\nBenefits of Using Engine Block Heaters\n\nUsing an engine block heater offers several advantages:\n\nIt improves cold-weather engine performance, enabling your vehicle to start quickly, even in freezing temperatures.\nBy reducing the strain on the engine during startup, it reduces wear and tear on the vehicle in extreme temperatures, prolonging the life of your car\u2019s engine.\nIt helps your battery and starter motor to last longer since there\u2019s less strain on cold starts.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditionally, by pre-heating the engine, it decreases fuel consumption and emissions, making it an eco-friendly option.\n\nLastly, engine block heaters can also improve passenger comfort by warming up the vehicle\u2019s interior faster.\n\nChoosing the Right Engine Block Heater\n\nSelecting the right engine block heater is crucial to reap the maximum benefits. Factors to consider include the climate in which you live, the type, and size of your engine, as well as the heater\u2019s power consumption. Compatibility with different vehicle types and models is another important consideration. When choosing a block heater for your car, it\u2019s essential to pick one that\u2019s compatible with your vehicle, and many vehicles can only use one style. For example, a vehicle with an aluminum oil pan can\u2019t use a magnetic engine heater, but will very likely be able to have a freeze plug heater installed.\nWhether you refer to it as an engine block heater or a car heat plug, this device plays a critical role in maintaining your vehicle\u2019s performance under harsh weather conditions. Armed with the right knowledge, you can make an informed decision about the best engine block heaters for your vehicle.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What are the Different Types of Engines?",
        "content": "Understanding the Basics\n\nThe basis of any engine is a device that can convert a fuel into a type of energy that can be harnessed and used to propel a vehicle. For some, it\u2019s gasoline or diesel that\u2019s burned, converting explosive heat in the cylinder into mechanical energy. It causes the crankshaft to rotate, which is transferred through the drivetrain to turn the wheels. For others, electric energy causes kinetic energy as it receives an electric current.\nBy far, the most common designs used in automotive manufacturing is still the internal combustion engine, and it\u2019s dominated by gasoline engines. They\u2019re the lowest cost to produce and are relatively efficient compared to previous generations. However, along with EVs, hybrid powertrains are also available, combining the technological advantages of an electric motor with conventional gas engines.\n\nInternal Combustion Engines\n\nInternal combustion engines have been the backbone of automotive power for over a century. The basic principle involves burning a mixture of fuel and air within the engine to produce controlled explosions that drive the pistons, ultimately turning the crankshaft and propelling the vehicle forward.\nThis combustion process is commonly referred to as the four-stroke cycle, consisting of intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes, and for the engine to run smoothly and efficiently, each step needs to work flawlessly. There are two main types of internal combustion engines.\n\nGasoline Engines\n\nMost cars on the road today are powered by gasoline engines. These engines burn a mixture of gasoline and air to generate power. They are known for their smooth operation and are suitable for a wide range of driving conditions. The air-fuel mixture is compressed to a ratio of between 8:1 and 12:1 so the energy is condensed.\nWhen the mixture is compressed in the combustion chamber, a spark plug ignites it, causing an explosion that forces the piston downward.\n\nDiesel Engines\n\nDiesel engines, commonly found in trucks and some passenger vehicles, operate on diesel fuel. These engines are known for their fuel efficiency and torque, making them ideal for heavy-duty applications. In these engines, the air-fuel mixture is compressed to a ratio of between 14:1 to 22:1 typically.\nWhen it\u2019s compressed, the kinetic energy is quicky forced to an extreme level, and the temperature skyrockets. The mixture doesn\u2019t need a spark to ignite it \u2013 instead, it combusts on its own.\n\nForced Air Induction\n\nTwo other designs are adaptations on gas and diesel engines: turbocharging and supercharging. Turbocharging involves compressing the air by a turbine in the exhaust before it enters the combustion chamber. It results in more air and fuel being burned, and thus, more power. Turbocharged engines are popular in performance-oriented gas vehicles, and many diesel engines use turbos to produce higher horsepower and torque too.\nSimilar to turbocharging, supercharging increases the amount of air entering the engine but uses a different method. A supercharger is driven by a belt connected to the engine\u2019s crankshaft, providing instant power and responsiveness. You typically only see superchargers on gas engines.\n\nElectric Motors\n\nAs technology continues to advance, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent on our roads. Electric motors offer a different approach to powering vehicles, relying on electricity stored in batteries rather than traditional combustion processes.\nElectric motors operate on the principle of electromagnetism. When an electric current flows through a coil of wire in the presence of a magnetic field, it generates a force that causes the rotor to turn. These rotors are in a direct-drive electric motor that could drive a pair of wheels, or there could be two or four motors in one vehicle. In EVs, this process is powered by lithium-ion batteries, which store and deliver electricity to the motor.\nElectric motors offer plenty of advantages, such as instant torque, quiet operation, and zero emissions. As technology evolves, electric vehicles are becoming more accessible and practical for everyday use.\n\nHybrid Engines\n\nHybrid vehicles combine the benefits of internal combustion engines and electric motors, offering a versatile, efficient powertrain. These vehicles can operate on electric power at lower speeds and seamlessly switch to the combustion engine for higher speeds or when additional power is needed.\nAdvantages of hybrid technology include:\n\nFuel efficiency \u2013 Hybrids achieve better fuel efficiency by utilizing electric power for city driving, where combustion engines are less efficient, and seamlessly transitioning to the combustion engine on the highway.\nReduced emissions \u2013 The electric mode of hybrid vehicles produces zero emissions, contributing to a cleaner environment, especially during stop-and-go traffic.\nRegenerative braking \u2013 Hybrids often incorporate regenerative braking, where the kinetic energy during braking is converted into electrical energy and stored in the battery, recouping a small amount for later use.\n\nRotary Engines\n\nRotary engines, also known as Wankel engines, offer a distinctive alternative to traditional piston-driven engines. Instead of pistons moving up and down, rotary engines use a triangular rotor that spins in a circular motion within a housing. They produce similar power to a small V6 in a much lower-displacement design. Mazda made them popular with the introduction of the Cosmo, RX-7, and RX-8 models.\nWhy is this car engine desirable? Reasons include:\n\nHigh RPM and smooth operation \u2013 Rotary engines can achieve high revolutions per minute (RPM) and get there faster, and they operate more smoothly than traditional engines due to their simple design with fewer moving parts.\nCompact size \u2013 Rotary engines are inherently compact, making them suitable for applications where space is a constraint, such as in sports cars.\nUnique sound and performance \u2013 The design of rotary engines results in a distinct sound and performance characteristics, appealing to enthusiasts seeking something different.\n\nWhether you\u2019re driving a traditional gasoline-powered car, exploring the world of electric vehicles, benefiting from hybrid technology, or enjoying the unique characteristics of a rotary engine, each type has its advantages and applications. As technology continues to evolve, the automotive landscape will undoubtedly witness further innovations in the realm of car engines.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How A Car Engine Works",
        "content": "The Anatomy of a Car Engine: Components and Their Functions\n\nUnderstanding how a car engine works begins with a peek under the hood. A car engine is a marvel of engineering, composed of various components working in harmony. Let\u2019s break down the key players:\n\nPistons and crankshaft. Pistons travel up and down inside cylinders, sealed against the cylinder walls with piston rings. The crankshaft, connected to the pistons by a connecting rod, converts their linear motion into rotational energy.\nCylinder block. This is the engine\u2019s core structure, housing the cylinders, pistons, and crankshaft. It provides a sturdy foundation for the engine\u2019s operation.\nCylinder head. Mounted atop the cylinder block, the head or heads form the top of the combustion chamber. They contain other critical parts like valve rockers, pushrods, ports for spark plugs and injectors, and passageways for air, coolant, and oil.\nTiming belt or chain. The timing belt or chain is looped over gears on the crankshaft and camshaft(s), synchronizing the functions between the upper and lower portions of the engine.\u00a0\nCamshaft. Responsible for opening and closing the engine\u2019s valves, the camshaft ensures the precise timing of the combustion process.\nValves. Intake valves allow the fuel-air mixture into the cylinders, while exhaust valves release the spent gases after combustion. When they\u2019re both closed, they allow for compression in the cylinder.\u00a0\nSpark plugs. The spark plugs create little sparks of electricity inside the compressed fuel-air mixture, creating controlled explosions that propel the pistons into their next cycle.\n\nThe Four-Stroke Cycle Unveiled: From Intake to Exhaust\n\nNow that you know the key components, let\u2019s dive into the rhythm of engine operation: the four-stroke cycle.\n\nStroke 1 \u2013 Intake. As the piston moves down, the intake valve opens, allowing a precise mixture of fuel and air to enter the cylinder.\nStroke 2 \u2013 Compression. The piston moves back up, compressing the fuel-air mixture. This compression is crucial for a powerful and efficient combustion.\nStroke 3 \u2013 Power. With the mixture compressed, the spark plug ignites it, causing an explosion. This force pushes the piston down, turning the crankshaft and generating power.\nStroke 4 \u2013 Exhaust Stroke. As the piston rises again, the exhaust valve opens, allowing the gases from the burned air and fuel to be pushed out of the cylinder.\n\nUnderstanding this cycle is key to grasping how a car engine converts fuel into motion. And no matter which engine you have, the strokes on each cylinder are staggered to make it run as smoothly as possible.\n\nFuel Injection vs. Carburetors: Choosing the Power Source\n\nNow that we\u2019ve demystified the cycle, let\u2019s explore how fuel is introduced into the engine. Typically, there are two types of fuel delivery systems that are used.\n\nModern engines often use fuel injection systems. These systems precisely deliver fuel to each cylinder with a fuel injector, optimizing combustion for efficiency and performance. A computer module precisely times when to inject fuel in each cylinder as well as how much.\nOlder engines, and some classic car enthusiasts, favor carburetors. These devices mix air and fuel before introducing them into the cylinders. Rather than actively spraying into the cylinder, they use vacuum to draw fuel into the engine. While carburetors have a nostalgic charm, fuel injection systems generally offer better fuel efficiency and emissions control.\n\nThe Role of Engine Oil: Keeping Things Running Smoothly\n\nYour car\u2019s engine is like a well-choreographed dance, and engine oil is the silent partner ensuring everything runs smoothly. It lubricates moving parts, reducing friction and wear. Pistons, crankshafts, and camshafts all benefit from this slippery companion. Along with lubrication, oil also helps to:\n\nKeep the engine cool. It absorbs heat from the engine components and transfers it to the oil pan and oil cooler, where it dissipates. This prevents the engine from overheating during operation.\u00a0\nResist corrosion. By coating metal parts in an oil film, they resist oxidation that would otherwise cause pitting and wear.\nPrevent sludge buildup. Engine oil contains additives and detergents that wash sludge deposits off of both moving and stationary parts.\nPrevent wear. Like a layer of molecular ball bearings between metal parts, engine oil actually prevents contact that would accelerate wear and tear internally.\nPromote fuel efficiency. With good, clean oil in the engine that reduces friction, you obtain the best fuel efficiency possible.\n\nTroubleshooting Engine Issues: A DIY Guide\n\nEven the most well-maintained engines can encounter issues. Here\u2019s a quick guide for DIY enthusiasts to tackle common problems:\n\nCheck the Spark Plugs. Fouled or worn-out spark plugs can lead to poor combustion and Check Engine Lights on. Replace them to ensure a smooth-running engine, typically every five years for modern engines.\nClean the Air Filter. A clogged air filter restricts airflow, impacting engine performance. Regularly clean or replace the air filter to maintain optimal combustion, typically once per year.\nInspect the Fuel System. Check for leaks in the fuel lines, and ensure the fuel injectors are functioning correctly with injector cleaner annually.\nMonitor Engine Oil. Regular oil changes are essential for engine health. Low oil levels or dirty oil can lead to increased friction and potential damage.\nListen for Unusual Sounds. Strange noises can be indicators of underlying issues. Pay attention to knocking, ticking, or hissing sounds and investigate promptly.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

The term \u201cpowertrain\u201d encompasses a series of components working together to ensure your car moves efficiently and reliably.\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the term \u201cdrivetrain\u201d, you\u2019re almost all the way there to understanding powertrain too. A drivetrain plus an engine or alternate propulsion system equals powertrain.\nAt the core of the powertrain lies a dynamic relationship between two critical components: the engine and the transmission. Think of the engine as the powerhouse, responsible for generating the raw energy required to propel your car forward. On the other hand, the transmission acts as the intermediary, ensuring that the power generated by the engine is effectively transferred to the wheels. Together with other parts that make it happen, these components create a seamless connection that is fundamental to the functionality of any vehicle.\n\nKey Components of a Powertrain\n\nGenerally, there are three portions of a powertrain that can be differentiated. Each of them has a distinct purpose.\n\nThe Engine\n\nThe engine, often considered the heart of the powertrain, is where the magic begins. Whether fueled by gasoline, diesel, or electricity, the engine converts chemical energy into mechanical energy, propelling the vehicle forward.\nInternal combustion engines, prevalent in most cars, ignite a mixture of fuel and air to produce controlled explosions that drive the pistons, ultimately turning the crankshaft and generating power. An electric motor essentially does the same thing, drawing energy from a battery pack to cause an electric motor to turn.\n\nTransmission Systems\n\nTransmission systems manage the power generated by the engine and transfer it to the wheels. Automatic or manual, transmissions regulate the speed and torque, ensuring optimal performance in various driving conditions. Automatic transmissions use fluid coupling and gears, seamlessly adjusting between them, while manual transmissions rely on the driver\u2019s input to engage and disengage gears.\n\nDrivetrain Elements\n\nBeyond the engine and transmission, the drivetrain consists of additional components essential for power transfer to the wheels. The driveshaft, differential, and axles work in tandem to distribute power evenly, allowing your car to navigate turns and varying road conditions. In AWD and 4WD systems, a transfer case disperses power between the front and rear axles to optimize traction and performance.\nAlong with these major components, some manufacturers also include the following as drivetrain components:\n\nWheel hubs\nAxle shafts\nCV joints\nWheels\n\nUnderstanding these elements provides a holistic view of how power flows from the engine to the wheels, ensuring a smooth and controlled driving experience.\n\nTypes of Powertrains\n\nConventional powertrains, powered by either gasoline or diesel engines, have been the backbone of the automotive industry for decades. Gasoline engines rely on spark ignition, while diesel engines use compression ignition. Both types offer unique advantages, with gasoline engines excelling in responsiveness and diesel engines providing superior fuel efficiency and torque.\nTo address the growing demand for fuel efficiency and environmental consciousness, hybrid powertrains emerged as a blend of traditional combustion engines and electric propulsion. These systems combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor, allowing the vehicle to operate on either power source or a combination of both, depending on the design. This versatility gives you better fuel efficiency, reduces emissions, and might also provide a smoother driving experience.\nAs the automotive industry continues to evolve, electric powertrains have emerged as an option growing in popularity. EVs exclusively rely on electric motors powered by batteries. With zero tailpipe emissions and lower maintenance requirements, electric powertrains are considered sustainable and forward-thinking.\n\nMaintenance and Troubleshooting Tips\n\nMaintaining a healthy powertrain is crucial to keep your vehicle working as well tomorrow as it does today. Regular checks include engine oil, transmission fluid, and other vital fluids, not to mention mechanical inspections, to ensure that all components operate smoothly. Consult your vehicle\u2019s manual for recommended maintenance schedules, and don\u2019t overlook routine inspections of belts, hoses, and other wear-prone parts to catch potential issues before you experience an unexpected failure.\nDespite being complex mechanically, powertrains can face common issues that may impact how well they operate. Symptoms such as rough shifting, strange noises, or decreased power may indicate problems within the powertrain. Diagnosing and addressing these issues promptly is essential.\n\nRegularly service your vehicle. Prevention is the best practice for your powertrain, especially as problems tend to be expensive to repair. Follow the maintenance guide to the letter.\nWatch for warning lights. Your oil light, transmission temperature gauge, and other indicators can let you know of issues before there\u2019s lasting damage.\nDon\u2019t ignore noises. Knocking noises, pinging, and other noises while you drive could be signs of impending problems. A repair now could be significantly less expensive than if you put it off.\nDiagnose any clunks and rattles. Although clunks or banging noises when you turn or go over bumps might seem like steering or suspension issues, they could be powertrain-related. Dig into the root cause.\n\nWhether you drive a traditional gasoline-powered car, a hybrid, or an electric vehicle, grasping the fundamentals of your car\u2019s powertrain empowers you to make informed decisions about maintenance, repairs, and might even influence your future automotive choices.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

The cylinder block is essentially the engine\u2019s housing, and it contains a series of cylindrical holes called cylinders. These cylinders are where the real action happens. Pistons, on the other hand, are like the heart\u2019s pumping muscles.\n\nThe Cylinder Block\n\nThe engine block, often made of cast iron or aluminum, houses the cylinders, providing a sturdy and secure environment for the internal combustion process. The engine\u2019s parts are bolted to the cylinder block in some fashion. It also has channels and passageways that allow various fluids to circulate through the engine, such as coolant and oil. These channels help in temperature regulation and lubrication.\n\nPistons\n\nPistons are cylindrical components that move up and down inside the cylinders. They are connected to the engine\u2019s crankshaft through connecting rods. As the fuel-air mixture ignites in the cylinders, the resulting high-pressure gases push the pistons downward. This motion is what generates the mechanical energy needed to power your car.\n\nPiston Rings\n\nPiston rings are circular bands that fit around the pistons, creating a seal between the piston and the cylinder wall. They prevent the escape of combustion gases from the combustion chamber and help distribute oil on the cylinder walls for lubrication.\n\nConnecting Rods\n\nConnecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft. They play a critical role in transferring the up and down motion of the pistons to the rotational motion of the crankshaft, which ultimately drives the wheels.\n\nCrankshaft\n\nThe crankshaft converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion. This rotation is what drives the various engine accessories and ultimately propels the vehicle forward.\n\nCylinder Head and Valvetrain\n\nThe cylinder block and pistons do the heavy lifting, but they rely on the cylinder head and valvetrain to control the flow of air and fuel in and out of the cylinders.\n\nThe Cylinder Head\n\nThink of the cylinder head as the brain of the engine. It sits atop the cylinder block, sealing the cylinders and creating a combustion chamber. Inside the cylinder head, you\u2019ll find the intake and exhaust ports, as well as the spark plug openings. These are the entry and exit points for air, fuel, and exhaust gases.\n\nValvetrain\n\nThe valvetrain consists of valves, camshafts, and other components responsible for opening and closing the intake and exhaust valves in sync with the engine\u2019s operation. When the intake valve opens, air and fuel enter the cylinder. Then, when the exhaust valve opens, combustion byproducts exit.\n\nCamshaft\n\nThe camshaft is a long within the cylinder head that\u2019s responsible for actuating the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves. It does so by following a carefully designed cam profile, ensuring precise valve timing.\n\nTiming Chain or Belt\n\nThe timing chain or belt connects the camshaft to the crankshaft, synchronizing their movements to maintain precise valve timing. It\u2019s crucial for the engine to run efficiently and avoid damage.\n\nFuel and Air Delivery System\n\nTo ignite the engine\u2019s power, you need the right mixture of fuel and air.\n\nAir Intake System\n\nThe air intake system is responsible for delivering clean air to the engine. It includes an air filter to remove impurities and a series of ducts or tubes that guide the air into the intake manifold. The throttle body controls the amount of air entering the engine, affecting its performance.\n\nFuel Delivery System\n\nThe fuel delivery system ensures the engine gets the right amount of fuel to mix with the incoming air. It includes components like the fuel pump, fuel injectors, and the fuel tank. Fuel injectors precisely spray fuel into the intake manifold, where it mixes with the incoming air. This mixture is then compressed in the cylinders before ignition.\n\nThrottle Body\n\nThe throttle body is responsible for regulating the amount of air that enters the engine. By controlling the size of the opening, it dictates the engine\u2019s power output and RPMs based on driver input.\n\nFuel Injectors\n\nFuel injectors spray a fine mist of fuel into the intake manifold. They are electronically controlled and pulse to release the correct amount of fuel to match the incoming air, ensuring an exact air-fuel mixture.\n\nIntake Manifold\n\nThe intake manifold is a network of tubes or passages that distribute the air-fuel mixture to the cylinders. It optimizes the flow and distribution of the mixture, contributing to the engine\u2019s performance and efficiency.\n\nEngine Lubrication and Cooling\n\nAs the engine runs, it generates a tremendous amount of heat and friction. Proper lubrication and cooling are vital to keep things in check.\n\nLubrication System\n\nThe lubrication system\u2019s primary job is to reduce friction and wear among moving parts. It relies on engine oil, an oil pump, and a network of channels to distribute oil to various engine components. Without proper lubrication, the engine\u2019s moving parts would grind against each other, causing significant damage.\n\nCooling System\n\nEngines can get scorching hot during operation, and overheating can lead to severe damage. The cooling system prevents this by using a mix of water and coolant to regulate the engine\u2019s temperature. The water pump circulates coolant through the engine and radiator, where heat is dissipated into the surrounding air. A thermostat helps maintain the engine at the optimal temperature for efficiency and longevity.\nThe fundamental parts of an engine work together like a well-orchestrated symphony, converting fuel and air into motion. The cylinder block and pistons provide the power, while the cylinder head and valvetrain control the flow. The fuel and air delivery system ensures the right mix, and the lubrication and cooling systems keep everything in check.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What is a Throttle Body and How Does It Work?",
        "content": "What Is a Throttle Body?\n\nEssentially, a throttle body is a device responsible for controlling the amount of air that flows into your car\u2019s engine. When you press down on the gas pedal, the throttle body opens up to allow more air to enter the engine, which also draws more fuel into the engine, and then causes the car to accelerate. It\u2019s a core component in any combustion engine vehicle, and if it fails, you\u2019ll likely notice a decrease in performance.\n\nHow Does a Throttle Body Work?\n\nThe throttle body is responsible for controlling the amount of air that enters the engine.\u00a0 Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nThe throttle body is connected to the accelerator pedal by a mechanical linkage in older vehicles or electronically in modern vehicles with drive-by-wire systems. When you press the accelerator pedal, it opens the throttle plate (also known as the butterfly valve) inside the throttle body, allowing more air to enter the engine.\nThe throttle position sensor (TPS) is an integral part of the throttle body, monitoring the angle of the throttle plate. As the accelerator pedal is pressed or released, the TPS sends an electrical signal to the engine control module (ECM) indicating the current throttle plate position.\nThe engine control module (ECM) is responsible for managing various engine functions, including fuel injection, ignition timing, and air intake. Based on the input from the throttle position sensor, the ECM calculates the appropriate amount of fuel required to mix with the incoming air. This ensures proper combustion so you get the desired engine power and performance.\nAs the throttle plate opens, more air flows into the engine through the intake manifold. The ECM adjusts the fuel injectors to deliver the correct amount of fuel, creating an ideal air-fuel mixture for combustion. When the accelerator pedal is released, the throttle plate closes, reducing airflow and fuel delivery.\n\nWhen to Replace Your Throttle Body\n\nIf the throttle body fails, you\u2019ll experience several symptoms that can affect both performance and fuel efficiency. One of the most apparent signs is a rough idle or stalling because the engine isn\u2019t receiving enough air for the fuel it\u2019s being delivered. You might also detect decreased acceleration or even lack of response when pressing the gas pedal.\nAnother sign is an illuminated Check Engine Light on your dashboard, with a DTC related to idle speed or throttle body issues.\nDon\u2019t ignore these symptoms, as they can lead to more severe problems down the line. If you suspect a faulty throttle body, deal with it right away to save yourself a headache and potentially added costs.",

        "title": "What is a remote engine starter?\u00a0",
        "content": "How a remote engine starter works\u00a0\n\nA common remote starter uses a radio frequency to communicate a command to start the engine when the corresponding button or sequence is pressed on the remote key fob. It\u2019s wired into the electrical system to override the ignition so your engine can start when you aren\u2019t in your vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, most vehicles from the 2000\u2019s to current, and many earlier models too, have an anti-theft system installed that prevents unauthorized starts without a chipped key present at the ignition. The remote engine starter also has a module that mimics the security chip as well, bypassing the requirement for an ignition key.\u00a0\nOnce it\u2019s started, the remote start runs the engine until a predetermined timer completes, and the engine turns off.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTypes of remote starters\u00a0\n\nNot all remote starters are created equal or operate the same way. Generally, there are four categories to consider.\u00a0\nFactory installed remote starters\u00a0\n\nMany carmakers have remote start as a factory-installed option that uses the same key fob as you\u2019d use to lock and unlock the doors. It employs already-existing wiring and electronic modules to perform the remote starting operations. Some carmakers also offer the same systems as dealer-installed options.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne-way aftermarket remote engine starters\u00a0\n\nAftermarket remote starters are accessories added to your vehicle that require additional wiring, a remote start module, and a separate key fob to control your system. Along with starting your car, it can be wired in and set up to control power door locks too.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe remote sends the command to your car but does not receive a confirmation back, this the term one-way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTwo-way aftermarket remote engine starters\u00a0\n\nTwo-way remote starters are essentially the same system as a one-way in how it\u2019s installed. It performs similar functions, but the major difference is the remote itself. A two-way remotes for car starters have either an LED or a screen that provides feedback from your car after it receives a command. Some systems with an LCD screen on the remote can also display the countdown until the engine will shut off.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nApp-controlled remote starter\u00a0\n\nSome remote start systems, both from factory and aftermarket, can be controlled by an app as well as the remote. App-based controls are cellular-based and require that the remote start has a network connection to operate. However, it means that the range is no longer limited to a quarter mile or so, but can be controlled wherever the operator and the vehicle both have a cellular connection.\u00a0\n\nBenefits of a remote engine starter\u00a0\n\nThere are plenty of good reasons to consider purchasing and installing a remote starter in your vehicle.\u00a0\nIt warms and circulates the engine oil. Driving a car with a cold engine can be hard on it, and a remote start allows the oil to become less viscous and flow better.\u00a0It shortens the time to reach operating temperature. When it\u2019s started remotely in extreme weather, the interior can warm or cool to a manageable temperature within a few minutes while you stay comfortable inside.\u00a0The windows get cleared. When the windshield is foggy or frosty, remotely starting the engine can clear it before you hop in and drive.\u00a0It can trigger other accessories. When you remote start, it\u2019s often possible to have your heated seats or steering wheel come on at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0It can help you find your car in a parking lot. When you press a button, the lights will usually flash as a response to the command.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow much does a remote car starter cost?\u00a0\n\nThe price of a remote car starter varies depending on the kit you purchase, whether it\u2019s a one-way or two-way system, and if you are planning on installing it yourself or having a professional take care of it. At the low end, a remote starter system will cost around $60 if you don\u2019t have an anti-theft system in your car. The prices range upward from there to more than $500 for a two-way system that has app control and the security override module.\u00a0\u00a0\nInstallation can also take a few hours or more, depending on your skill level. Even a professional mechanic will need an hour or more to complete the install.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhere can you install a remote engine starter on your car?",

        "title": "Supercharger vs. Turbocharger: What\u2019s the Difference?\u00a0",
        "content": "What are turbochargers?\u00a0\n\nTurbochargers look like a large metal snail mounted inline with your car\u2019s exhaust. It has two sides: a compressor section and a turbine section. As the engine runs, exhaust gas is funneled through the turbine section to spin the turbine wheel at extremely high RPMs. The compressor section is attached beside it and, as the turbine spins, the compressor wheel also spins, compressing air and discharging it into the air intake.\u00a0\u00a0\nTurbochargers have a wide range of sizes available, and various boost levels as a result. They essentially force more oxygen-rich air into the engine so it can mix with fuel and be burnt, allowing more power from a smaller displacement.\u00a0\nWhat are turbochargers best used for? Primarily, manufacturers use turbos to achieve similar power levels in a smaller package. It allows them to downsize from a V8 to a V6, for example, with no noticeable power difference.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut turbochargers aren\u2019t all upside. Three things that can be considered a disadvantage are:\u00a0\u00a0\nTurbo lag. Since the turbo needs to spool up, there\u2019s a \u2018hole\u2019 in performance until a certain RPM is achieved. Essentially, it\u2019s a delay between when you call for the power and when you feel it kick in.\u00a0Heat. Turbos can run extremely hot, and that heat gets transferred to the air inside. Heat robs an engine of power, so manufacturers add air vents to cool the engine bay and an intercooler to cool the air before it enters the air intake. It complicates the design.\u00a0Cost. While they\u2019re durable, turbochargers can be pricey to replace if they fail.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat are superchargers?\u00a0\n\nWhat is a supercharger? A supercharger also compresses air that\u2019s forced into the engine, but in a different method than a turbo. It\u2019s usually a mechanically-driven compressor that\u2019s bolted to the engine, although there are recent instances of electric superchargers too.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow does a supercharger work? When the engine is running, a belt spins the supercharger\u2019s pulley, turning the internal gears that are connected to an impeller in the compressor. The compressed air is then funneled into the intake to burn.\u00a0\nSuperchargers are typically used when there needs to be power available from low RPMs all the way up through the range. Since it\u2019s belt-driven, boost pressure is always created when the engine is running. That means there\u2019s more even acceleration and power delivery throughout the entire RPM range.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is a supercharger\u2019s downside? There are a few:\u00a0\u00a0\nSuperchargers rob the engine of power. As it\u2019s driven by a belt, the supercharger can require as much as one-third of the engine\u2019s power to spin.\u00a0They\u2019re bulky. Depending on the style \u2013 Roots style, twin-screw, or centrifugal \u2013 they can take up a lot of space in the engine bay.\u00a0They can affect reliability. Supercharged engines tend to fail sooner than naturally aspirated engines.\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a turbocharger and supercharger?\u00a0\n\nWhile turbos and superchargers effectively do the same thing, there are distinct differences.\u00a0\u00a0\nTurbos are driven by exhaust gases, superchargers are belt driven. That\u2019s important since turbochargers don\u2019t steal energy from the engine to operate, which is why they produce what\u2019s often called \u201cfree power\u201d.\u00a0Turbochargers are more complicated. Superchargers don\u2019t heat up as much as a turbo does, so they can sometimes send air directly into the engine. Turbos almost always require an intercooler to reduce the intake temperature, creating more energy-dense air for combustion. Turbos also need additional parts like a blow-off valve.\u00a0Superchargers always have power ready. When you step on the gas, a supercharged engine will immediately have power available while a turbocharged engine will take a second to make power while the RPMs increase.\u00a0\n\nWhat is right for your vehicle?\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s possible in some situations to bolt a turbocharger or supercharger on a naturally aspirated engine, but most people looking for this performance part are searching for a replacement, not a power adder. When that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s important to use the same type and size that came with your car from the factory. Modifying or replacing a forced air induction with a different kind will require professional tuning, if it\u2019s possible at all, and might require even more modifications like larger fuel injectors and a higher volume fuel pump.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re looking for a power adder, though, it\u2019s best to find a kit rather than piecing it all together.",

The check engine light flashing when accelerating combined with white exhaust appearing and disappearing suggests a sticking fuel injector.\nIf an injector doesn\u2019t want to close once it\u2019s opened when you accelerate, it dumps way more fuel than needed into the cylinder. Unburnt fuel exits the exhaust, showing up as white smoke. This unburnt fuel can also overload the catalytic converter, causing it to melt.

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Water Pump",
        "content": "Signs Your Water Pump is Failing\n\nLeaking coolant\n\nA coolant leak can indicate many failures, but if it\u2019s coolant on the front of the engine, it\u2019s often a water pump leak. It\u2019s possible that the water pump gasket where it mounts to the engine is what\u2019s leaking, but it could also be the seal on the water pump shaft. Regardless, leaking coolant on the engine that drips to the ground is an indicator that is serious. Replacing the water pump and gasket should be in the plans.\nFor minor leaks, you\u2019ll notice a white trail of residue where it drips down the front of the engine, tinged with the color of your coolant. The leak may never reach the ground because the heat from the engine dries the coolant on the metal surfaces. Changing the water pump might also require changing the timing belt, the water pump pulley, the serpentine belt, or other engine seals and gaskets.\n\nOverheating\n\nIf your engine is overheating, it\u2019s a sign that the heat generated from combustion isn\u2019t being transported to the radiator to be cooled. It can be due to several things such as:\nAn air pocket or airlock in the cooling system that prevents coolant from circulating, potentially due to a water pump leak.\u00a0The fins on the water pump impeller have been sheared off by debris or freezing,\u00a0The shaft is seized due to corrosion or bearing failure.\nOverheating is a serious condition, and if you see the temperature gauge spike or have a warning message on your instrument cluster, stop your car as soon as possible and shut the engine off until it cools down. Repeatedly overheating your engine is a surefire way to cause lasting damage such as a blown head gasket, warped cylinder head, or even seizing the engine.\n\nSquealing noise\n\nA squealing or chirping noise from the front of the engine can also be an indication of a failing water pump. It can sound very much like when a serpentine belt is making noise, and in many cases, that\u2019s because it is. Additional resistance from the water pump can cause the belt to slip along the pulley, usually with a rhythmic cadence that\u2019s relative to the engine\u2019s RPMs.\u00a0\nAgain, the cause is usually a worn shaft bearing. In some cases, the water pump can maintain this type of operation for weeks or months, or even longer, or it could fail immediately after by seizing up. While it\u2019s one of the early signs of a bad water pump, it should be taken seriously, even if the noise comes and goes.\n\nWhining noise\n\nFor water pumps on cars, the belt-driven or chain-driven pulley spins a shaft that turns an impeller inside the pump. If the symptom is a whining noise that varies with engine RPMs, it might not be an internal problem at all. Rather, a whine often indicates that either the belt isn\u2019t tight enough or the pulley is damaged.\u00a0\nIt might be surprising to hear that a pulley could be the cause, but it can happen. The pulley can crack between the bolt holes, and as a result, it doesn\u2019t run true. It\u2019s usually caused by rust on the pulley, so it\u2019s mostly an issue on older cars.\u00a0\nFor some vehicles, water pump pulleys are part of the assembly while for others, they can be replaced separately.\u00a0\n\nWater pump corrosion\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing bad water pump symptoms, it can be due to corrosion. Inside the pump, contaminated or improperly mixed coolant can contribute to corrosion on the impeller. One the exterior, corrosion can cause issues with the belt slipping on the pulley. And in some cases, visible corrosion or buildup on the water pump itself can indicate it\u2019s failing with no other symptoms at all.\u00a0\n\nCost to replace car water pump\nIf your water pump is bad, deal with it right away. Postponing the repair often leads to more expensive repairs at inconvenient times. Along with the cost of a water pump that averages between $150 and $250 for most modern cars, you\u2019ll likely need coolant and gaskets. It\u2019s also a good time to check the serpentine belt condition and replace it if necessary.\u00a0\nIf it\u2019s a job you aren\u2019t prepared to tackle, expect labor at a professional mechanic to add a couple hundred dollars.\u00a0\n\nFAQ for a Bad Water Pump",

        "title": "How to Replace a Camshaft Sensor",
        "content": "What does the camshaft sensor do?\u00a0\n\nA camshaft sensor is a device that monitors the position of the camshaft in an engine. It sends this information to the engine control unit, which uses it to regulate the engine\u2019s operation. The camshaft sensor consists of a cylindrical body with a protrusion on one end. The protrusion often uses the Hall principle, meaning that the sensor voltage changes based on its proximity to the camshaft\u2019s ring gear. Of course, this means that the cam sensor is positioned near the top of the engine, typically mounted in the cylinder head, the cylinder block, or in the timing cover.\u00a0\nWhen an engine is running, the camshaft sensor\u2019s position is constantly changing as the camshaft turns. The sensor produces an electrical signal that is proportional to the camshaft\u2019s position. This signal is sent to the engine control unit, which uses it to determine the correct timing for fuel injectors and ignition coils.\u00a0\n\nSymptoms of a bad camshaft sensor\u00a0\n\nIf the camshaft sensor is not working properly, the engine will not run correctly. It\u2019s because the engine control unit doesn\u2019t know what position the camshaft is in, so it\u2019s unable to adjust the timing and other key operations for the engine to run smoothly and efficiently.\u00a0\u00a0\nSymptoms of a faulty camshaft sensor include:\u00a0\n\nEngine misfires\u00a0\nRough idling\u00a0\nPoor fuel economy\u00a0\nCheck Engine light is illuminated, typically with code P0340\u00a0\n\nIf it\u2019s reading incorrectly at times and functions properly at other times, your symptoms might be intermittent. In other cases, the symptoms are constant until the sensor has been replaced.\u00a0\n\nWhat causes a camshaft sensor to fail?\u00a0\n\nThe cam sensor is designed to last a very long time. For a lot of vehicles, it will last its entire lifespan without needing to be replaced. On others, it\u2019s a common point of failure.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are several things that can cause a camshaft position sensor to fail, including:\u00a0\n\nMoisture or dirt getting into the sensor. If the resistance changes in the sensor due to moisture or dirt, it will affect the reading that\u2019s sent to the engine control module. The false or disrupted reading will cause incorrect adjustments for timing and fuel.\u00a0\nThe sensor getting hot enough to melt. If the sensor body is exposed to extreme temperatures like from the engine overheating, it could melt.\u00a0\nThe connector coming loose or breaking. The retaining clip on the electrical connector could become brittle and break, or it could wiggle loose. Whether moisture penetrates the connector or the terminals corrode, the sensor won\u2019t operate properly.\u00a0\nThe wire harness being damaged.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSteps to change a camshaft position sensor\u00a0\n\nChanging a cam sensor isn\u2019t an overly complicated job, but it requires some basic tools and a code reader to get the job done right.\u00a0\n\n1. Disconnect the negative battery cable\n\nFor any work on the electrical system or engine, disconnect the battery first to prevent accidental short circuits. \n\n2. Locate the camshaft sensor\n\nYou may need to take off the engine cover if it has one. Then, find the camshaft sensor either at the timing cover, on the cylinder head, or on the side of the engine block. It will be mounted near the top, and will have a wiring connector attached to it. There could be two, three, or four wires in the connector. \n\n3. Remove the connector\n\nTo prevent unnecessary movement, the connector is usually fastened in place. Remove the bolt or screw holding it, then disconnect the connector, being careful not to break the plastic. \n\n4. Remove the sensor\n\nNext, remove the fasteners holding the sensor into the engine. Often, it\u2019s two bolts you\u2019ll need to remove. Keep them safe since the hardware isn\u2019t included with the new sensor. \n\n5. Take the cam sensor out\n\nLift the sensor out of the engine and remove the O-ring seal from the hole in the engine block. It might take a firm wiggle and twisting motion to unseat it. Take extreme care not to pry on it as the sensor could break, requiring significantly more work to extract it. \n\n6. Install a new O-ring seal\n\nThe O-ring prevents oil from exiting the sensor\u2019s hole and keeps dirt on the outside. You should install a new O-ring in the hole in the engine block. \n\n7. Install the sensor\n\nPosition the new sensor in the same orientation in the engine and secure it with the two bolts. Use the correct torque spec to prevent cracking the new part. Reconnect the sensor\u2019s wiring connector and connect the negative battery cable. \n\n8. Clear the existing codes\n\nUsing a code reader, clear the Check Engine light to prevent the old codes from creating ongoing issues. Fire up the engine and, if your code reader is equipped with a monitoring feature, check that there aren\u2019t any new or pending codes and that the cam sensor is reading correctly. \n\nHow much does a camshaft sensor replacement cost?\u00a0\n\nGet your new camshaft position sensor at AutoZone.

        "title": "Why is My Car Stalling While I Am Driving?",
        "content": "Charging System Issues\n\nThe alternator is a car component that acts as an electrical generator, converting mechanical energy stored in the battery into electrical energy in the form of alternating current. Your car uses said current to power everything, from replenishing the battery to running the A/C and lighting up the instrument cluster.\nThe alternator usually provides between 13.5 and 14.5 volts, ensuring normal vehicle operation. A faulty alternator can cause significant voltage drops, sometimes even below 12 volts, which could lead to the vehicle stalling, rapid battery discharge, flickering lights, and much more.\nIf your car has a faulty alternator, you probably won\u2019t be able to start it up again. Unfortunately, if this happens, you\u2019ll need to get the alternator replaced.\n\nFuel System Issues\n\nIssues with the fuel system are also relatively common, but sometimes it can be extremely difficult to figure out exactly which component of the fuel system is to blame for the issue.\nThe fuel system is a complicated network of car components that all work together to provide fuel and, ultimately, enable combustion inside your engine. Issues associated with the fuel system commonly result in loss of fuel pressure.\nA clogged fuel filter is the easiest and least expensive component to replace. If your fuel filter is not able to let enough fuel flow through to the engine, simply replacing it might solve the issue.\nA more severe issue is a failing fuel pump since they are much more expensive to replace and requires significantly more expertise.\n\nIgnition System Issues\n\nUnlike diesel engines which use compression to ignite the fuel/air mixture, gasoline engines rely on a spark plug to set off the combustion cycle.\u00a0 A faulty spark plug could cause a sudden stall though it will most commonly only result in a cylinder misfire.\nFaulty ignition coils, worn-out distributor caps, and severely damaged rotor buttons can all cause spark loss, which as we explained, can lead to a stalling engine. You may experience these issues while driving or when simply sitting stationary when you\u2019ll notice a car stalling at idle.\n\nSensor Issues\n\nIf there\u2019s nothing wrong with your car mechanically, the fault could lie in one of the dozens if not hundreds of sensors scattered throughout your vehicle. The car\u2019s brain, the ECU, relies on data from these sensors to control the engine and prevent catastrophic engine damage.\nThe most common sensor which can lead to your car stalling is the manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP) or the mass air flow sensor (MAF). Most cars typically have one or the other.\nIt\u2019s the MAP/MAF sensor\u2019s job to measure the air density entering the engine and calculate how much fuel should be used to provide the optimal fuel-to-air mixture based on that data. If this sensor fails completely or provides inaccurate data, the ECU can make the fuel/air mixture too lean or too rich, causing ineffective combustion and a stalling engine.\nOther sensors which could potentially cause your vehicle to stall include the engine coolant temperature sensor and the throttle position sensor which measures the position of the accelerator pedal.\nAlthough slightly less common, a faulty crankshaft or camshaft sensor could also lead to your car stalling, both while driving or when stationary. Additionally, certain issues related to the idle air control valve (IAC) or the throttle body itself can be the reasons behind stalling the engine.\n\nVacuum Leaks\n\nSome cars and car systems rely on vacuum to perform their job effectively and as intended. When discussing a vacuum leak, people usually refer to a leak in the intake manifold that brings in more air than the engine can handle or is prepared for.\nAs you can imagine, an air leak will cause the car to run lean, which means that the mixture inside the engine doesn\u2019t have enough fuel in it to combust as intended. Vacuum leaks are most noticeable at startup, especially in colder climates, where your car wants to run rich for the first few minutes until it gets up to temperature.\nVacuum leaks will give symptoms such as engine misfire, delayed acceleration, and most notably, an extremely rough and choppy idle. All of these symptoms could lead to stalling provided the leak is large enough.\n\nTiming Belt Issues\n\nThe engine uses a drive belt to power the rest of the components and systems, such as the A/C compressor and the power steering pump. If one of these components locks up or freezes, the drive belt won\u2019t be able to go over the pulley smoothly and it\u2019ll encounter a great amount of resistance.\nIf the timing belt doesn\u2019t snap, the engine crank pulley will effectively take the brunt of the force, causing your car to run like it has half the amount of horsepower or completely smothering the engine, stalling your vehicle in the process.\n\nContaminated Fuel\n\nAlthough extremely rare in this day and age, contaminated fuel is something that could cause your vehicle to stall, especially if you\u2019ve just filled up at a gas station you\u2019ve never used before. More often than not, your vehicle will be able to use contaminated fuel but run a little rougher until the next time you fill up. If the contamination is severe enough, you may need to drain the gas tank completely and fill it up with fresh fuel.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Why Won't My Car Start?\u00a0",
        "content": "The engine doesn\u2019t crank at all\u00a0\n\nIf your car\u2019s engine refuses to crank when you turn the ignition key, you might potentially have a dead battery on your hands. Coincidentally, a dead battery is the most common reason why your car doesn\u2019t want to start.\u00a0\nIf you have a battery tester, the first thing you\u2019ll want to do is to check the battery and see if it\u2019s weak. If you don\u2019t have a battery tester or you desperately need to get somewhere, you can try jump-starting your car using jumper cables. Note that if you successfully start your car you\u2019ll need to leave it running for several minutes to allow the alternator an ample amount of time to recharge the battery. The best thing you can do though is to use a battery charger to top it up, and the old saying, \u201clow and slow\u201d applies here.\u00a0\nSometimes, something as simple as battery corrosion can prevent you from starting the engine. If you haven\u2019t replaced your battery in a very long time, the terminals might be corroded and unable of providing a clean connection. Simply cleaning the terminals can do the trick in this instance.\u00a0\nIf none of this works, you\u2019ll need a new battery that\u2019s able to hold a charge and provide enough electrical energy to start the engine.\u00a0\nIf you notice a clicking sound when attempting to start the engine but the engine itself doesn\u2019t turn or crank over, you\u2019ve probably got a bad starter. It\u2019s the starter motor\u2019s job to physically turn the engine over and help the engine burst to life. Starter motors have a pretty long service life, but sometimes they can fail in as little as 30,000 miles. A new starter motor will fix this issue.\u00a0\nThe ignition coil is responsible for transforming the battery\u2019s voltage into an electric spark that the engine uses to ignite the fuel/air mixture. A bad ignition coil is recognizable if your car won\u2019t start but all of the lights work normally. This indicates that the battery is operational and is able to hold a charge, so there\u2019s probably an issue somewhere else, possibly with the ignition coil itself.\u00a0\n\nThe engine cranks but it doesn\u2019t start\u00a0\n\nA clogged fuel filter is a common reason why your car doesn\u2019t start, assuming the battery isn\u2019t dead. Generally speaking, fuel filters need to be replaced once every two years or once every 30,000 miles. Failure to do so might cause a clogged-up fuel filter that is unable to let enough fuel flow through to the engine. Simply replacing the fuel filter might solve these fueling issues.\u00a0\nAnother reason why your car doesn\u2019t want to start could be because of a failed fuel pump, though this is relatively rare. A damaged pump will usually need to be replaced by a professional and is significantly more expensive than simply replacing the fuel filter.\u00a0\nLast but not least, as rare as it is, you might have a bad timing belt on your hands. As its name would imply, the timing belt opens and closes the valves, ensuring they never touch the pistons and cause catastrophic engine damage. The timing belt needs to be replaced in regular intervals, before it can snap and blow up the engine. This is usually once every 60,000 to 100,000 miles.\u00a0\n\nOther reasons why your car won\u2019t start\u00a0\n\nAs silly as it sounds, you want to check the fuel level in your fuel tank and make sure that it isn\u2019t empty. Most of us have probably been there at one point or another, so there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Forgetting to put enough fuel in your car is something most of us will do at least once in our lifetime, so just make sure your fuel tank isn\u2019t empty if your car refuses to start. The silver lining in all of this is that there\u2019s nothing wrong with your car mechanically and it won\u2019t cost you anything to fix. Simply fill up your fuel tank and be on your way.\u00a0\nAdBlue is a diesel exhaust fluid that most modern diesel engines used to reduce harmful gases from being released into the atmosphere. Much like fuel, your car uses AdBlue the more you drive it and you\u2019ll eventually need to top it up. Unfortunately, some modern cars will refuse to start at all if there isn\u2019t enough AdBlue in the tank. In this case, filling up the tank with enough AdBlue will allow you to start the engine.\u00a0\nQuite often, the reason why your car doesn\u2019t want to start is something as simple as a dead battery or a clogged-up fuel filter. Fixing these will be relatively inexpensive and quick. If you need to replace a fuel pump or a timing belt on the other hand, you\u2019re probably going to spend a bit more money to get your car in working order.\u00a0\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

Depending on the type of damage, a head gasket sealer can help fix a blown head gasket. If it\u2019s resulted in a small leak, it may permanently take care of the problem. However, if the damage is a bit more advanced, a head gasket sealer may only be a temporary solution for fixing your head gasket.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor this reason, it\u2019s important to inspect your head gasket if you see any signs of engine trouble. Understanding the problem will help you know if using a head gasket sealer is the right solution or if you need to have a professional mechanic look at the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen Should I use a Head Gasket Sealer?\u00a0\n\nThere are ways to tell if your head gasket is damaged, and you need to invest in a sealer. Here are some things you should look out for:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEngine misfiring \u2013 If you feel a jerking motion when accelerating your car, you may have an engine misfire. This is a result of your engine\u2019s cylinder not firing, which causes a combustion reaction not to happen. If this becomes frequent, you may have a blown or leaking head gasket.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhite smoke from your exhaust \u2013 A leaking head gasket can lead to your coolant burning, resulting in white smoke from your car\u2019s exhaust. \u00a0\nCooling system issues -If you notice bubbles in the cooling system or your coolant has evaporated without seeing a leak, you may also be witnessing a blown head gasket problem. \u00a0\nCar is overheating \u2013 If the temperature warning light is illuminated on your dashboard or the hood of your car is hot to the touch, then your vehicle is likely overheating, which could be due to a head gasket issue.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhile the above instances can point to other issues, it\u2019s worth checking the head gasket if they\u2019re happening. If it\u2019s damaged, consider using a head gasket sealer. \u00a0\n\nHow to Use a Head Gasket Sealer\u00a0\n\nAre you wondering how to fix a leaking head gasket? We\u2019ve got you covered. Here\u2019s a step-by-step process of using a head gasket sealer to mend a leak.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Get the necessary materials\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need the right items to start the process. Here is a list of materials you\u2019ll need:\n\nHead gasket sealer\u00a0\u00a0\nCar Jack\u00a0\u00a0\nA bucket\u00a0\u00a0\nWrench\u00a0\nA container of water\u00a0\nCoolant\u00a0\n\n2. Elevate your car\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll use a jack to elevate your car from the ground. Once you ensure the car is securely suspended, move on to the next step.\n\n3. Prepare to collect the coolant under the radiator\n\nLocate where the radiator is underneath your car and put a container below it. This is to ensure that you can collect the coolant that leaks from this area once you release the petcock. Be sure to consult your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual so you know the amount of coolant your vehicle contains so you can get the right-size bucket or container to hold it. \n\n4. Drain the coolant\n\nGo to the radiator and locate the petcock. Use a wrench or pliers to loosen it and let all of the coolant liquid drain into the bucket. \n\n5. Close the petcock and add water\n\nAs soon as the coolant stops draining out, close the petcock. You\u2019ll then open the radiator cap and add water to the radiator.\n\n6. Remove the thermostat\n\nThe thermostat can get gummed up by the sealer you\u2019re about to add to the system. So, take it out temporarily it to keep this from happening. \n\n7. Turn on the car and heater\n\nTurn on the heat and ignition. Doing this will help circulate the water throughout the vehicle so it can drain out any remaining coolant. Keep an eye on the dashboard for any potential high-temperature warning.  \n\n8. Drain the water\n\nAfter you\u2019ve cleared out the rest of the coolant, drain the water and any remaining coolant into the bucket. Then, close the petcock for the radiator.\n\n9. Add the coolant and water mixture\n\nBlend a 50-50 distribution of coolant and water. Consult your owner\u2019s manual to determine the best coolant to use for your car, and only add in small amounts at a time until you reach capacity.  \n\n10. Add the head gasket sealer\n\nNow is when you\u2019ll add in the head gasket sealer. Open the radiator cap and slowly add in the sealer. If you\u2019re wondering what is the best head gasket sealer for your car. Look at our selection, including products like Bar\u2019s Leaks Block Seal Head Gasket Sealant 20oz. Always consult the sealer\u2019s instructions to ensure you\u2019re following the correct steps for adding it to your vehicle.\n\n11. Drive your car, then let it sit\n\nReplace the radiator cap and restart your vehicle. From there, drive your car for under 30 minutes to help the head gasket sealer move throughout your vehicle. After that, let your car sit for two to three hours before moving on to the last step.\nPut the thermostat back in \u2013 Now that the sealant is activated, it shouldn\u2019t plug up the thermostat. Install it back into the cooling system.\n\n12. Check for leaks\n\nAfter letting it sit, check to see if the head gasket sealer stopped the leak. Check for white exhaust, misfiring, or white build-up under the oil filter cap. If all looks well, you\u2019re done!",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Head Gasket Leak",
        "content": "Understanding Head Gasket Function\n\nThe head gasket is a seal that fits between the engine block and cylinder head, ensuring you keep compression in the combustion chamber and preventing coolant or engine oil from leaking into the cylinders.\nUnlike many other types of seals and gaskets, a cylinder head gasket is usually made of stamped metal and strategically placed seal coatings. Many modern-made options contain a few layers of stainless steel, making an even better seal with between the head and the engine block.\nBut with extreme heat inside the combustion chamber, not to mention corrosion that can form, the thin barriers between the cylinders, oil passages, and coolant channels can be affected. Even a small defect in the sealant can cause a leak that may start out small initially but eventually give you full-on blown head gasket symptoms.\n\nCommon Signs of a Head Gasket Leak\n\nThe symptoms you experience will vary depending on where the gasket is leaking, what substance is leaking, and how bad it is. You might notice:\n\nOverheating \u2013 It\u2019s the most prevalent and worrisome sign of a head gasket leak. If the engine consistently overheats, it could be due to coolant leaking into the cylinders or externally, reducing the coolant capacity and causing excess heat to build up.\nLoss of power \u2013 With a cylinder\u2019s seal leaking, low compression will occur, and it leads to worsening performance.\nMilky engine oil \u2013 If the seal is disrupted and coolant leaks into the engine oil, it mixes and the oil can look like chocolate milk.\nWhite tailpipe smoke \u2013 If coolant is leaking into the combustion chamber, it turns to steam laden with the coolant\u2019s additives and displays as white smoke from the exhaust.\nRough idling and misfires \u2013 Whether you have oil or coolant leaking into a cylinder, it can contaminate the spark plug, causing a misfire.\nExternal coolant or oil leak \u2013 In some cases, if the head gasket leaks externally, you\u2019ll see traces of coolant or oil on the engine block, originating from the seal between the head and block.\n\nWith any of these issues, it\u2019s extremely common for a Check Engine light to come on too, typically with misfire codes.\n\nEffects of Ignoring a Head Gasket Leak\n\nIgnoring a head gasket leak can become a very serious and costly issue. When it\u2019s still a minor leak, you might have the annoyance of oil or coolant to clean off your driveway or garage floor, but it usually won\u2019t stop there.\u00a0 Left unrepaired, the engine temperature is likely to climb into the danger zone when it reaches operating temperatures, and if it overheats, the cylinder head can warp, making the leak even worse.\nShould the symptoms continue to be overlooked, there\u2019s potential for the engine to experience a major failure that requires a teardown and rebuild or replacement.\nAlong with these direct issues, leaving a head gasket leak unrepaired could also result in:\n\nA contaminated catalytic converter \u2013 If engine oil or coolant are entering the cylinder and going out with the exhaust, they can contaminate the catalyst structure inside the converter.\nInternal cylinder damage \u2013 Coolant leaking badly into a cylinder can wash away lubrication, exposing the walls to scuffing and wear.\nCorroded internal parts \u2013 The valves, pistons, spark plugs, and other parts can get caked with carbon, sludge, or corrosion, causing a host of issues.\n\nDiagnosing Head Gasket Issues\n\nLeaking or blown head gasket symptoms should be diagnosed as quickly as possible when symptoms are present. Testing for issues can involve:\n\nA compression test \u2013 This involves removing spark plugs and checking each cylinders pressure with a specialized compression tester. A significantly lower reading in one or more cylinders could indicate a head gasket issue.\nChemical tests \u2013 Certain chemicals react with combustion gases in the coolant, and testing for them can indicate whether there\u2019s a head gasket failure.\nChecking for oil in the coolant and vice versa \u2013 The presence of oil in the engine coolant can indicate the head gasket is compromised between these passages, and the same for coolant in the engine oil.\n\nA test drive is a great place to start, though. If the engine temperature climbs higher than normal on your drive or the engine performance deteriorates the longer you drive, it can be symptoms of a leaking head gasket.\n\nPreventive Maintenance Tips\n\nOne of the best ways to keep head gasket issues at bay is with routine cooling system maintenance, as that\u2019s where most avoidable problems originate. Flush and replace the coolant according to the manufacturer\u2019s schedule, and check the level and top it off every time you change the engine oil. Never ignore signs that the engine is overheating. Also, if you notice frothy, milky residue under the oil cap or in the oil during oil changes, check the cooling system to ensure it\u2019s not leaking into the engine.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Does Motor Mount Replacement Cost?",
        "content": "Types of engine mounts\n\nYour engine mounts connect the motor to the rest of the vehicle. When you rev your engine, it will typically move slightly, but a worn-out engine mount will allow too much movement and could cause damage. There are five common types of motor mount in use today.\nSolid Rubber Motor Mounts use a combination of rubber with a steel backing plate and are probably the most common motor mount in production today. They offer simplicity and strong durability, but the rubber will eventually wear out, causing the mount to loosen. Solid rubber motor mounts also provide middle-of-the-pack vibration damping.\nMetal Motor Mounts are extremely durable and will rarely fail, but they transmit vibrations much more readily than either rubber or hydraulic motor mounts, and this is why they are not as common.\nPolyurethane Motor Mounts are stiffer than solid rubber but offer more pliability than steel motor mounts. They will also tend to last longer than solid rubber mounts, but are less resistant to heat, when compared to steel mounts.\nHydraulic Motor Mounts use a fluid or gel like glycol within the mount to dampen vibration from the engine. The upside to hydraulic motor mounts is that they can be tuned to specifically attenuate certain frequencies and reduce vibrations. The downside to this technology is that they are more complex to manufacture when compared to solid rubber motor mounts, and therefore more expensive. The complexity of the design also means that there are more potential parts that can break down in the mount.\nElectronic Engine Mounts are sometimes referred to as Active Engine Mounts because they use positioning sensors to monitor the position of the engine, the RPMs, speed, and other factors, to tailor the amount of damping force to the mount. For example, the active motor mounts in use on several models of Hyundai, Toyota, and Honda will relax the stiffness of the mount when the engine is at idle, to attenuate some of the harshness of their 4-cylinder engines but stiffen up the motor mounts as RPMs rise.\n\nWhat does it cost to replace an engine mount?\n\nMotor mounts can be relatively simple, or very complex, so it\u2019s no surprise that there is a huge range of prices for different types of motor mount. If you\u2019re asking yourself how much it should cost to replace motor mounts, you can start with these numbers as a guide.\nA very simple steel or rubber mount may start around $10 and can rise to $150, depending on the make and model of vehicle. Complicated hydraulic or active motor mounts will tend to be more expensive, starting at more than $50 and rising to the $200 range.\nThe labor cost for a motor mount replacement will be dependent on how accessible the mount is. For a motor mount that is right on top of the engine it may only take 30 minutes for a mechanic to swap out the old mount and replace it with a new one. If the motor mount is buried in the engine bay, you may be looking a two or more hours to gain access. That translates to a labor cost of $100-$450 per mount.\n\nSymptoms of a bad motor mount\n\nYour motor mounts are tasked with reducing vibrations and holding the engine in place, so the symptoms of failing motor mounts tend to be related to vibrations of some kind. Here are some of the top symptoms of failing motor mounts that you may encounter:\n\nIncreased vibrations when idling or driving are one of the main symptoms of a bad motor mount. Before you go out and buy a set of mounts, though, investigate to see if you have a misfiring cylinder because that can also cause severe engine vibrations.\nIf you hear or feel a thud or lurch when starting or stopping the engine, you should check your engine mounts to see if they are providing too much play, leading to excessive engine movement.\u00a0\n\nOdd impact noises from the engine compartment might be the cause of a worn-out motor mount allowing the engine to touch other components in the engine bay. You will want to replace the failing mount as soon as possible to avoid more damage.\nIf you can see that the motor mount is cracked or excessively worn you should plan to replace it before it causes some of the other symptoms.\n\nHow to replace an engine mount\n\nIs it worth replacing engine mounts, especially if the vehicle is old? Like many preventative maintenance tasks, the answer is usually yes, because you could be avoiding more trouble and expense down the road by investing a little time and treasure now.\n\nAlways start by removing the negative wire from the battery, to avoid any electrical issues.\nYou will also need to support the engine properly so that when you remove the mount, the engine is safely suspended.\nDepending on which mount you are removing, you may need to use a jack to elevate the car and always use a set of jack stands to support the vehicle when you work on it.\nNow, with the engine supported, remove the bolts attaching the engine to the motor mount and the motor mount to the chassis. Swap in the new motor mount and if the bolts are aluminum, replace the bolts.\n\nFor some vehicles and motor mounts, you may need to remove parts of the subframe or other engine bay parts to access the mounts, but if you take the time and have the correct tools, replacing your motor mounts is usually a Saturday job.",

        "content": "5 Things You Might Forget When Cleaning Your Car\n\n1. Cleaning The Car Engine\n\nIf you want to take care of your car, you need to start with the engine. Over time, conventional motor oil can create a buildup of sludge and other deposits that can cause engine degradation. The good news is that cleaning your engine is as simple as switching to a motor oil with sludge fighting capabilities.\nAll Mobil 1\u2122 motor oils utilize their signature Triple Action Formula to remove sludge buildup after just one oil change\u2014keeping key engine components clean, protected, and performing at their peak for a smoother, more relaxing ride.\n\n2. Vacuuming Between the Car Seats\n\nJust because it\u2019s out of sight, doesn\u2019t mean it should be out of mind. This hidden spot is one of the most overlooked places to clean in your car. The accumulation of dust, dirt, and fast food can decrease the interior air quality as well as degrade your vehicle\u2019s fabric and carpet. Maintaining these unseen areas can keep your car feeling fresh and make your drive a whole lot nicer.\nCleaning it is as simple as pushing your seats as far forward as they can go and using a vacuum to clean out the mess. AutoZone offers a wide selection of vacuums made specifically for all the hard-to-reach places in your vehicle.\n\n3. Sun Visors\n\nThe sun visor might be something you touch daily, but how often do you clean it? This surface can become covered with the dirt and germs that we bring in from the outside world. Over time, they can begin to stain and become a sign of an aging vehicle. Good news is that with regular cleaning, you can keep your car looking like new for longer while avoiding all those pesky germs.\nYou can clean your sun visors as well as the rest of your interior surfaces using one of the countless cleaning products and wipes offered at AutoZone.\u00a0\n\n4. Clean Wiper Blades\n\nMany people don\u2019t think to clean something that\u2019s meant to clean your car, but if you don\u2019t, the same grime that you find on your windshield can accumulate on your wipers leaving streaks and causing your wiper blades to deteriorate much faster. To fully enjoy the road ahead, you need to see it first and that means taking care of your windshield wipers.\nWhile the more solid parts of your wipers can be washed with soap and water, the blades themselves need be carefully wiped clean with a spritz of rubbing alcohol. If your blades are too far gone, you can easily replace them at AutoZone.\n\n5. Car Door Jambs\n\nWe\u2019ve talked about the interior and the exterior, but we\u2019re ending this list with something that\u2019s a bit of both. The door jamb is the space between the door and wall of your car and is often never cleaned at all. These places can accumulate and trap dirt, mud, and sometimes even mold if left untreated long enough.\nLuckily, this is one of the simpler areas to clean. Just open your doors and wipe it down with a wet towel to remove years of dirt and grime.\n\nHit the road with confidence\n\nMany drivers don\u2019t care enough to give their car a clean this deep, but you understand the value of regularly maintaining your vehicle. The drive is only as perfect as the car and by giving it the right polish and the right motor oil, you\u2019ll be well on your way towards a better drive on the road ahead.",

        "title": "Why is My Engine Ticking?",
        "content": "Why is My Engine Ticking?\n\n1. Low Oil Level, Oil Pressure, or Worn Engine Components\n\nLow oil, oil pressure, or worn tolerances in the valvetrain, can trigger a very distinguished ticking sound. People often call this \u201clifter tick.\u201d The top end of your engine will suffer initially if you do not have adequate oil or adequate oil pressure. While some vehicles do have valve adjustments that can be made, the majority do not. Over time, low oil pressure, or lack of oil changes can cause problems with lifters, followers, or the camshaft itself, causing ticks. Make sure you are full of oil, it\u2019s being properly changed, and have any suspicious ticks checked out quickly. If you are unsure where to turn, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help diagnose.\n\n2. Exhaust Leak\n\nYour car\u2019s exhaust system is sealed up tight \u2014 any leakage, especially closer to the engine, like an exhaust manifold, will produce a very loud tick as the exhaust pulsates. The remedy here is to find the source of the leak and repair. This could be a gasket, a crack in something like the exhaust manifold, or a pipe / flange that has actually failed. Many times, you will be able to see black soot around a suspect area where there is a leak, so check all gasket mating surfaces and flanges carefully when looking for a leak.\n\n3. Bad Bearing\n\nSometimes, a front-engine accessory, pulley, or bearing can trigger a ticking sound. This can occur with AC compressors, water pumps, alternators, belt tensioners, or pulleys. If you suspect there may be a component ticking, one method for diagnosis is to remove the drive belt and hand-spin each component. If nothing is still suspect, start the engine and immediately listen to see if the tick has disappeared. Keep in mind that without the drive belt, you should never leave the engine to run longer than 10-20 seconds, as in most cases, the water pump is not working. Listen to see if the tick has gone away, and if it has, you have narrowed it to being one of the accessories that the belt is powering. You can hook the belt back up and use a mechanics stethoscope to help narrow down where the noise is coming from.\n\n4. Engine Fan or Loose Parts\n\nEvery engine has a fan of some type. With the engine off, visually inspect the fan blades and shroud for damage.\n\n5. Ignition Issues\n\nYour engine\u2019s cylinders are designed to fire at a specific time. If this timing is off, it can create a pinging noise, but this will also trigger a check engine light as well. If no lights are present, this is likely not the issue.\n\nHow to Fix a Ticking Noise in the Engine\n\n1. Oil-Related Concern\n\nStart by examining your oil level. Pull out the oil dipstick, clean it off, reinsert it, and then pull it once again. If it\u2019s low, top it up \u2014 however, know that you might have an oil leakage. Inspect the level frequently to see if it drops, and keep an eye out for leaking oil under the vehicle or under the hood, or small areas of oil on the back of the vehicle near the exhaust.\nInspecting your oil pressure is your next action. Make sure it\u2019s at least 15-20 psi when the engine is warmed up and idling if you have an oil pressure gauge in your control panel instrument cluster. You might have a worn or sticking engine part if the oil level and pressure check out.\nOne last possibility of significant engine problems is called rod knock, which is different from a tick. A rod knock is louder, and deeper, and instead of originating at the top of the engine, sounds more internal. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between an engine tick or knock, but a mechanic can help diagnose this.\n\n2. Exhaust Leakage\n\nRepairing exhaust leakages can be labor-intensive, specifically on automobiles with rusted hardware. But these repairs can generally be done easier by DIY if you choose.\n\n3. Bad Bearing\n\nOnce you have diagnosed where the part is that\u2019s making noise, it can either be repaired, rebuilt, or replaced.\n\n4. Engine Fan\n\nExamine the heat and dust guards, metal lines or brackets, or anything else that can vibrate and come in contact with another part while running. Take a look at the bottom of the hood for contact marks.\n\n5. Ignition Issues\n\nEngine Ticking Noise on Startup\n\nTicking on start-up, especially in the cold,\u00a0winter months can be normal. As an engine gets older,\u00a0its\u00a0ability to\u00a0immediately\u00a0build oil pressure gets tougher, so parts like lifters and other engine parts may need a second to get the proper oiling and build pressure. Excessive ticking during start-up could be an issue though and may need to be looked at.\n\nExtra Advice on Engine Ticking\n\nEngine ticking could be benign, or it could be\u00a0very serious. Either way,\u00a0it is\u00a0unsettling to hear and you will want to figure out the root cause right away.

        "title": "How to Do an Engine Compression Test",
        "content": "What is a Compression Test?\n\nIf your engine loses compression on one or multiple cylinders, problems will follow. From a misfire to a massive reduction in power, there are some severe and complicated problems that can arise. A compression test is by far one of the most basic engine test procedures and starting point to understand exactly what your engine is doing, and where the problem may be.\nThe premise of a compression test is to test each cylinder to see in measured PSI exactly how much compression that particular cylinder is producing. From a single piston lawn mower engine, to a diesel or V8 engine, the process is entirely the same \u2013 measure what the cylinder is producing in PSI. \nUnderstanding a compression test procedure is also understanding what you are trying to achieve, and that is consistency between the numbers of each cylinder, and looking for the outlier, or outliers. If you measure the tire pressure of 4 tires on your car, and the measurement of three of them is 32PSI, but one of them is 15PSI, you immediately know you have an issue with that one tire, and further testing or inspection is needed to determine why. A compression test is much the same. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow Difficult is a Compression Test?\n\nA compression test is simple to learn and only requires a few basic tools. From a mechanical perspective, you will need to know how to properly remove the spark plugs on the vehicle or equipment you are testing and properly disable the ignition system and fuel system, the latter if the vehicle is fuel injected. For carbureted engines, you can choose to disable the fuel supply and run the carburetor out of gas, but most simply perform the test without doing this.\nHow easy it is to perform the test rests solely on the ability to perform the above tasks. A compression test can be done on either a hot or cold engine, or an engine that has been running or not running that you are attempting to diagnose problems with.\n\nHow to Do a Compression Test\n\n1. Get Your Equipment\n\nGather your tools, including insulated gloves (or nitrile) and safety goggles to protect yourself from hot parts and oil sprays. Keep in mind if working around a hot engine to be careful of hot engine parts like the exhaust manifolds. You will also need a good quality ratchet, an extension or two (a long one with a \u201cwiggle joint\u201d is a good idea on V6 or V8 engines), and a suitable spark plug socket \u2013 note that while a regular socket may fit, it\u2019s best to use an actual spark plug socket designed to remove spark plugs. You will need a notepad to jot down your readings and label each cylinder appropriately on your notes.\nA compression tester can be purchased or rented and includes a set of adapters that will screw into the spark plug hole. The adapter has a built in Schrader valve to trap pressure and a special gauge to show the compression readings. The Shrader valve in the adapter traps the compression in the gauge so you can do the compression test without an assistant. The gauge will also have a release button, which releases the trapped pressure after each reading.\nCaution: If you do have an assistant, make sure he/she knows NOT to spin the engine until you\u2019re absolutely ready, and always keep your hands clear of the belts and pulleys. Have paper and something to write with so you can record your readings as you go. Do some research and know how the cylinders are numbered so you can write the readings in order \u2013 you can find this information online if you don\u2019t know. \n\n2. Disable the Ignition and Fuel\n\nWhen performing the test, you don\u2019t want the engine to start during the test. With older vehicles using a distributor, you can disable the coil by disconnecting the positive terminal of the coil or unplugging the coil or coils completely. Avoid simply removing the coil-to-distributor wire as the coil is still charged and can still achieve a grounded spark and shock someone. If you have to remove the spark plug wires, first know how the cylinders are numbered and mark the wires with tape or a Sharpie or both to make sure you don\u2019t cross them while putting them back later. On vehicles with Coil-On-Plug (most modern vehicles) you will simply need to disconnect the coil\u2019s wiring harness as you remove each spark plug, or, you may be able to find a fuse that controls the ignition system.\nFor fuel injected cars, you will need to disable the fuel system. Begin by checking your fuse panel details, either in the owner\u2019s manual or under the fuse box cover and disable the fuel pump by removing the fuel pump fuse or the fuel pump relay if the vehicle is fuel injected. Carbureted engines with mechanical fuel pumps don\u2019t have a fuel pump fuse and will not need to have the fueling disabled unless you choose to do so.\nFinding the fuel pump fuse or relay is easier on some vehicles than others. Once you believe you\u2019ve disabled the fuel pump, verify that you\u2019ve disabled the fuel system by starting the engine until pressure is no longer in the fuel rail. Unless removing the fuse or relay also disabled the injectors and the ignition system, the engine will start initially after the fuel pump has been deactivated but then it will spin without starting as the residual fuel pressure is depleted.\nAt this point, you can listen to how the engine spins to see if one cylinder picks up speed while the engine is spinning \u2013 if so, one of the cylinders could have low compression.\n\n3. Remove the Spark Plugs\n\nUsing the ratchet, any necessary extensions, and the spark plug socket, screw all the spark plugs out. This is important because you don\u2019t want other compression strokes slowing the engine spin during the compression testing process.\n\n4. Get Your Compression Testing Kit in Order\n\nChoose the appropriate gauge for either gas or diesel. A diesel compression test typically requires the removal of the glow plugs and a special adapter for that engine.  Since diesel has a higher compression rating, it uses a special gauge. Screw the correct compression adapter into the glow plug or spark plug hole of the cylinder you plan to test first \u2013 it\u2019s good to start with cylinder #1, but you can do it in any order \u2013 just write down your readings next to the correct cylinder number.\n\n5. Begin the Compression Test\n\nA compression test is performed by then cranking the engine. This will then allow the gauge to read multiple compression strokes from that cylinder. Allow the engine to spin until the gauge has received at least six \u201cpuffs\u201d, then release the key. If the compression gauge is working properly, the needle will indicate the amount of max compression.\nCaution: If you do have an assistant, make sure he/she knows NOT to spin the engine until you\u2019re absolutely ready, and always keep your hands clear of the belts and pulleys. Remember to have paper and something to write with so you can record your readings as you go. Do some research and know how the cylinders are numbered (firing order) so you can write the readings in order \u2013 you can find this information online if you don\u2019t know. Consider using an assistant or remote starter if you\u2019re having trouble keeping track of the reading while turning the key.\nOnce you have a valid reading, record the cylinder number and PSI rating. Most gas engine\u2019s compression should be between 125 and 175 PSI while a diesel will generally fall between 275 and 400 PSI. Remember to write down each of your findings. If one or more cylinders looks to be way off in PSI, you can re-run the test again just to check.\n\n6. Finish the Test\n\nContinue the process of inserting the adapter, cranking the engine, and recording the results for all your vehicle\u2019s cylinders.  If one of the readings is significantly lower, it can indicate a problem with that single cylinder. Multiple low numbers can be a sign of other engine issues. Remember that what you are looking for is consistency. Cylinder pressures should not fall outside of 15-20% of each other, meaning, if you run a test on a V6 engine and come up with 150, 155, 150, 145, 135, and 130, this would fall within an acceptable level of consistency. If you run the test and come up with 150, 155, 90, 90, 135, and 130, this would indicate an issue as the highest pressure cylinder is significantly higher than the lowest pressure cylinder.\n\nDiagnosing Potential Problems\n\nA lack of compression is generally caused by 4 things \u2013 worn or damaged piston rings, damaged valves, improper valve timing, or a blown head gasket. The following can help pin-point possible problems.\n\nIndividual Cylinders being low PSI: If you only have a low reading on one cylinder or the cylinders aren\u2019t adjacent or next to each other, the problem is usually valve or piston ring related. By adding two or three squirts of engine oil from an oil can to a low compression cylinder through the spark plug hole, you can attempt to isolate the possibly of worn rings being the issue. Re-run the test, and if the compression increases once adding the oil, the chances are very likely piston rings are the culprit. Many multi-valve engines and turbo engines can run into issues with bent valves, or burnt exhaust valves, and even the slightest leak in a valve can cause low compression, and usually a misfire.\nAdjacent Cylinders: Two side-by-side cylinders with low ratings could be a blown head gasket. If you notice other symptoms such as milky oil or cloudy exhaust fumes, the head gasket probably needs to be replaced.\nAll Cylinders: When all your ratings are below 100 PSI for gas engines or below 275 for diesel, you may have a valve timing issue. First, be sure the valves are all properly opening and closing and that you do not have a broken belt, chain, or gears. This can be done in most cases by removing the valve covers and inspecting when the engine is cranking, and/or remove the timing inspection cover, which is usually available on any vehicle with a timing belt. It\u2019s not uncommon for a timing belt to skip timing as well, which will yield you improper valve timing. If you notice a lot of blow-by gas coming out of the oil filler cap with the engine running and compression is low, suspect worn out piston rings. In this case, the engine will need to be overhauled or replaced.\n\nKeep in mind that low PSI numbers on any combination of cylinders almost always indicate a problem that should be fixed sooner rather than later. Should you need to have a mechanic perform the diagnosis, you can always choose from our list of Preferred Shops in your area that can help you diagnose any engine-related troubleshooting.

        "title": "Why Is My Check Engine Light On?",
        "content": "Understanding the Check Engine Light\n\nThe Check Engine Light, often abbreviated as CEL, is a critical part of your vehicle\u2019s onboard diagnostics system. It\u2019s essentially your car\u2019s way of communicating with you. When this light illuminates on your dashboard, it\u2019s indicating that the Engine Control Unit (ECU) has detected a problem or irregularity in one or more of the many systems it monitors.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that the Check Engine Light doesn\u2019t pinpoint the exact issue. Instead, it serves as a general warning sign that something is amiss. To get to the root of the problem, you\u2019ll need to perform a diagnostic scan using a code reader to retrieve specific trouble codes. It generally indicates the direction you need to take to get to the bottom of your symptoms.\u00a0\n\nVisit Your Local AutoZone Store for Free Fix Finder Service\n\nVisit an AutoZone Near You!\n\nCommon Reasons for Check Engine Light Activation\n\nThe causes behind a Check Engine Light activation can vary widely, but some common culprits include:\n\n1. Loose or Faulty Gas Cap\n\nYour\u00a0gas cap\u00a0is part of a sealed evaporative emissions system that recirculates gasoline vapors from your gas tank and keeps them from escaping into the air. Because of this, this system of lines and valves is closely monitored, and one of the key sealing pieces of this is the gas cap.\nIf you leave your gas cap off accidentally, it won\u2019t take long before the diagnostic system sets Check Engine Light codes. These leaks in the EVAP emission control system are often grouped as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d leaks. Its important to note that the problem is not always the gas cap, but could be one of the plastic recirculation lines, fittings, or connectors causing the leak, but more often than not, the gas cap is the culprit.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou can lose fuel through evaporation.\nYour recirculation system will not function properly.\nYou will have to stare at the CEL until it\u2019s fixed.\n\n2. Oxygen Sensor Issues\n\nYour\u00a0oxygen sensor\u00a0measures the amount of unburned oxygen in your vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. It indicates how thoroughly the air-fuel mixture burned during the combustion process.Oxygen sensors also live a hard life in +800-degree exhaust temps and are prone to fail over 80,000 miles or more. It\u2019s important to note here that there are a multitude of engine codes where the oxygen sensor indicates something is wrong, not necessarily that the oxygen sensor is bad. Be careful determining that a sensor is truly at fault, as opposed to determining something else is happening. This cannot be more apparent than in the ever-popular\u00a0PO420 / PO421 engine code, which is detailed HERE.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour engine will burn more fuel than needed.\nYou will lose fuel economy, and get fewer miles per gallon.\nFaulty sensor(s) can cause damage to your spark plugs and catalytic converter.\n\n3. Engine Misfires\n\nIf your car is misfiring, you probably aren\u2019t wondering to yourself \u201cWhy is my check engine light on?\u201d Your\u00a0spark plugs\u00a0ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of your vehicle, but if the timing of that spark, the mixture of the fuel and compression of the mixture isn\u2019t perfect, you will get a misfire. Multiple issues can cause a misfire, either on one cylinder or a multiple cylinder misfire.\n\nDefective ignition coil:(either DIS or coil-on-plug). A quick trick to determine if a coil is causing a misfire is to simply move the coil and swap with another on the engine. If you have a #2 misfire and move the #2 coil to cylinder #4, for example, then the misfire moves to #4, you know the coil is suspect.\nDefective fuel injector: If a fuel injector fails to deliver the proper amount of fuel to a cylinder, you will have a misfire. Unlike swapping the ignition coil with a neighboring coil, a fuel injector is more difficult to move.\nVacuum leak:\u00a0Vacuum leaks often cause multiple cylinder misfires, or lean running conditions. They also can be very difficult to diagnose.\nWorn spark plugs and/or wires: Sometimes, spark plugs can go far past their life cycle and fail, causing a misfire. On vehicles with\u00a0spark plug wires, a defective wire or wires can also cause this. For many drivers with older cars, it\u2019s a likely reason the Check Engine Light came on.\nBad compression:\u00a0A burnt or bent valve, worn piston rings, or valve timing that is off will cause a misfire as well. These issues are more serious and will all become apparent during an engine compression test.\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou will experience poor performance (reduced power, engine missing) and reduced fuel economy.\nThe misfire will only get worse, and will lead to mechanical failure in the engine.\n\n4. Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) Troubles\n\nYour\u00a0mass airflow sensor\u00a0(MAF) measures the amount of air entering the engine to determine how much fuel is needed to run your engine properly. If there are any leaks before or after the mass airflow sensor in the intake tract, a light can trigger. Mass airflow sensors are sensitive to oil, dirt, and water vapor, and any contamination on them can trigger a light. Sometimes, cleaning the sensor with intake or mass airflow sensor cleaner can fix the issue. Other times, the sensor needs to simply be replaced. Be sure to check the intake ducting carefully for leaks, rips, or damage.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nA faulty MAF sensor can cause rich or lean conditions, which can lead to further failures of other parts.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\n\n5. Catalytic Converter Issues\n\nYour\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0helps protect our environment by superheating hydrocarbons and other harmful tailpipe emissions into compounds like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Your downstream oxygen sensors carefully monitor the converter\u2019s performance, and if something goes awry, a number of trouble codes based on \u201cCatalyst efficiency\u201d will appear.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a catalytic converter will more than likely not fail on its own. Generally, something causes it to fail or not perform properly. Because of this, simply replacing the converter or the oxygen sensors around it will often not fix the problem, and often leads to yet another failed converter. Things as serious as a blown head gasket can force burned coolant vapor into the exhaust, triggering a catalyst engine code.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour vehicle will not pass an emissions test.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\nWhatever caused the converter to fail initially will continue to get worse, possibly causing engine failure.\n\nInterpreting Check Engine Light Codes\n\nWhen the Check Engine Light comes on, it\u2019s time to connect an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner to your vehicle. This scanner retrieves diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that provide clues about the issue. These codes consist of a letter followed by numbers, such as P0420. The letter indicates the affected system, while the numbers provide further details.\nUnderstanding these codes is crucial to pinpointing the problem accurately. You can consult your vehicle\u2019s service manual or use online resources to interpret the codes. While a specific code might suggest a particular issue, further diagnosis may be needed to confirm the exact problem.\n\nDiagnosing and Addressing Minor Issues\n\nFor minor issues like a loose gas cap or a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, you may be able to address them yourself. In the case of a loose gas cap, simply tightening it can make the light disappear after a few driving cycles.\nReplacing an oxygen sensor or spark plugs can be a DIY project for those with some mechanical know-how. Just be sure to use the right parts and tools and follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nSerious Problems and Check Engine Light\n\nIn some instances, the Check Engine Light can indicate more severe problems. Issues like a failing catalytic converter or a malfunctioning transmission can trigger the light, and diagnosing what\u2019s the root cause isn\u2019t always clear. Attempting to tackle these complex repairs without the necessary skills and equipment can lead to costly mistakes, so you might want to get a professional to weigh in on it.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring the Check Engine Light\n\nIgnoring the Check Engine Light is not a wise choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDecreased fuel efficiency. Many issues that trigger the Check Engine Light can reduce your vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency, costing you more at the pump.\nIncreased emissions. A poorly performing engine can produce higher emissions, contributing to environmental pollution.\nEscalation of problems. What might start as a minor issue can escalate into a major, more expensive problem if left unaddressed.\nSafety concerns. In some cases, the Check Engine Light can illuminate due to safety-related issues, such as a faulty airbag system or braking system. Ignoring these warnings can compromise your safety on the road.\n\nDIY Troubleshooting vs. Professional Assistance\n\nKnowing when to DIY and when to seek professional help is crucial. If you\u2019re comfortable with basic maintenance tasks and the issue seems minor (like a loose gas cap), DIY troubleshooting may be appropriate.\u00a0\nHowever, for more complex issues or if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to consult a qualified mechanic or technician who can accurately diagnose and repair the problem. If you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\n\nTips for Preventing Unnecessary Check Engine Light Activation\n\nWhile not all Check Engine Light activations can be prevented, you can take steps to reduce the likelihood:\n\nRegular maintenance. Follow your vehicle\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule, which includes oil changes, air filter replacements, and spark plug checks.\nTighten the gas cap. After refueling, make sure to tighten the gas cap securely to prevent evaporation of fuel vapors.\nDrive responsibly. Avoid aggressive driving, which can strain your engine and lead to premature wear and tear.\nUse quality fuel. Choose reputable gas stations and use quality fuel to maintain your engine\u2019s health.\n\nThe Check Engine Light is your car\u2019s way of alerting you to potential issues. Understanding its significance, interpreting the codes it generates, and taking appropriate action can save you time, money, and stress in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Car Leaking Oil? How to Fix Engine Oil Leaks at Home",
        "content": "First, What Causes Oil Leaks?\n\nTo find out how your car is leaking oil, you have to figure out what caused the leak in the first place. There is no use in fixing a problem only to have it occur again. An oil leak can be caused by one of four problems. The most common cause of an oil leak is due to a degraded engine gasket. An engine gasket is a seal that ensures that lubricants do not leak. When there is a break in the gasket, you will begin to lose vehicle fluids. In most cases, you will leak motor oil. The other less common causes of oil leaks are an oil pan leak, oil seals, or bad connections. In order to find out what is causing the leak, you will want to inspect these four areas. \n\nInspecting Your Vehicle for the Cause of the Leak\n\nNow that you know the possible sources of your car leaking oil, it is time to crawl under the car and find out what is causing the problem. First, you will want to check the oil pan seals. Also, you will want to check the oil pan plug. After you check the oil pan, go ahead and take a look at the timing cover seal and the valve cover gaskets. Other places to look for a possible leak include the oil pressure sensor, the oil filter, and the oil cap. If you have an older vehicle with lots of worn parts, then it\u2019s possible that you may have multiple oil leaks.\n\nNow It\u2019s Time to Fix That Oil Leak\n\nAfter you have done your inspection, it\u2019s time to roll up your sleeves and learn how to fix an oil leak. You don\u2019t have to read a whole book to learn how to fix that leak. While there are some oil leaks that can only be fixed by expensive repairs, most can be done in your garage or driveway rather inexpensively. The only thing you will need is a car jack, jack stands, torque wrench, and some special additives or replacement parts (something like a new oil pan). Here are the two main approaches that you can take to fix your oil leak.\n\nUsing an Additive to Stop the Leak\n\nOne of the easiest ways to fix the leak yourself is to use a stop leak additive or high mileage oil blend. Such products can soften and condition your car\u2019s rubber seals to stop and prevent further automotive leaks. It may take up to a few hundred miles of driving before the leak is completely sealed. Next, you\u2019ll learn how to deal with an oil pan leak and other oil leak situations. You should generally try to fix the leak by replacing components before resorting to using stop leak.\n\nFixing the Problem with Tools\n\nDon\u2019t worry. Fixing an oil pan leak and other situations with tools is not as hard as you would think. All you need are some hand tools, a torque wrench, and a car jack and stands or some ramps. First, safely jack up the car so you can safely access the oil pan. Now, check for loose bolts on the oil pan. Over time, these bolts can loosen, and loose bolts leak. After tightening all the bolts on the oil pan, move over to the timing belt cover and the valve covers. Be aware that specific car models require you to tighten bolts in a certain pattern to a specific tolerance level. Check a service manual or repair guide for more information.\n\nAfter You Have Fixed the Leak, It\u2019s Time to Test\n\nOnce you believe you have fixed the problem, it is time to test everything out. Get about a quart of oil and top off your oil level. Afterward, you will want to turn on the engine with the hood up. Check the top of the engine while the car is running. Sometimes, you may find out that the oil is leaking from the gasket or the oil cap, and the engine will start to smoke because it is burning oil. It\u2019s important to know what causes oil leaks from all parts of your vehicle.\nAfter running the car for a couple of minutes, move the vehicle about 5 feet from where it was previously parked. Check to see if any oil leaks have accumulated on the driveway. If you still see an oil puddle, then you have to go back and recheck the tightening of your bolts.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOil leaks are one of the common and frustrating car problems that can occur. Before you take the vehicle to the garage for a hefty repair bill, learn how to fix an oil leak yourself. Remember to check everything from the oil pan to the gaskets and the oil cap. Be sure to double-check and make sure that you fixed the leak after the repair. With a little know-how and more patience, you will be able to handle any oil leak problem on your vehicle.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Bad Oxygen Sensor (O2) Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Purpose of Oxygen Sensors\n\nMost vehicles on the road today have internal combustion engines. To generate the power necessary to move the vehicle, the engine burns a precise mixture of fuel and air. This process, of course, creates certain emissions. Both to improve engine efficiency and minimize emissions, vehicles manufactured after 1980 have at least one O2 sensor.\nWith few exceptions, automotive internal-combustion engines require a oxygen-to-gasoline ratio of 14.7:1. If there is not enough oxygen in the mixture, excess fuel sticks around after combustion. Mechanics call this a rich mixture. If the reverse happens, the phenomenon is known as a lean mixture. Both can wreak havoc on your vehicle\u2019s performance and gas mileage. Even worse, the wrong fuel mixture can result in serious engine damage.\nCar manufacturers place oxygen sensors in specific areas to ensure the fuel mixture is neither rich nor lean. The number of sensors in a vehicle, though, differs. Those with V6 and V8 engines typically have three. A car with a four-cylinder engine, on the other hand, may more commonly only have two.\nOperationally, O2 sensors are basic. If the fuel-to-oxygen ratio is off-balance, a chemical reaction creates voltage. This voltage sends information to the vehicle\u2019s\u00a0electronic control module. Thus, if the sensor is not working properly, the computer must guess the amount of fuel that is necessary. If the guess is incorrect, pollution and poor performance may be the result.\n\nSigns of a Faulty or Failing Oxygen Sensor\n\nCommon Check Engine Light Causes: Oxygen Sensor\nAn oxygen sensor does not have to fail completely to give you problems. On the contrary, even a failing O2 sensor (sometimes called a \u201clazy\u201d O2 sensor) may cause your car to have a few issues. If you notice any of the following signs, you may have a bad O2 sensor or one that is about to go bad:\n\nAn illuminated check-engine light\nA rough engine idle\nA misfiring engine\nWorsening fuel economy\nFailed emissions inspection\n\nEven if your car\u2019s engine is not exhibiting any of the above oxygen sensor symptoms, it may still be time to replace your existing ones. In simple terms, O2 sensors are designed to wear out over time. As such, if your vehicle has driven 60,000 to 100,000 miles on with its existing sensors, depending on make and model, you may want to consider replacing its O2 sensors before they fail. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual may specify a service interval you better understand when to preventatively install new sensors.\nThe following parameters may be helpful guideline for when to replace your oxygen sensors:\n\nModel years from the mid-1990s to present day, replace O2 sensors every 100,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s with heated three- and four-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 60,000 to 70,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1970s to early 1990s with unheated one- and two-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 40,000 to 50,000 miles\n\nDiagnostic Procedures\n\nIf you suspect your car has an old, damaged or ineffective oxygen sensor, you can likely either confirm or dispel your suspicions with an OBD-II scanner.\u00a0These scanners plug into your vehicle\u2019s computer and display diagnostic trouble codes. The exact error code for identifying a potentially faulty oxygen sensor, though, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Still, you should be able to glean enough information from the scanner\u2019s readout to determine if you have a sensor-related problem.\nNonetheless, you should realize that other problems may register the same diagnostic code as a faulty oxygen sensor. For example, you may have trouble with your vacuum system. As such, before replacing your O2 sensors, you likely want to inspect your vehicle\u2019s engine for other problems.\n\nReplacement Options\n\nIf you are unable to determine if you have a bad O2 sensor from your OBD-II scanner or a visual inspection, you likely want to take your vehicle to a reliable mechanic. You want to visit someone who has a diagnostic scan tool. This mechanic can tell you with virtual certainty whether you need to replace your O2 sensor. He or she also can likely pinpoint which oxygen sensor has failed.\nWhen it comes to replacing a faulty O2 sensor, you have a couple options. Because sensors are plug-and-play, you may be able to do the replacement yourself. That said, sensors are not always easy to access. Even worse, sometimes the old sensors can seize in place, making them very difficult to remove.\n\nTotal Cost\n\nThe total O2 sensor replacement cost depends on whether you do your job yourself. If you do, you only need to budget for the price replacement sensors, but you will need to clear the codes with an OBD tool (Rent through Loan-A-Tool\u00ae). This price, of course, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Many sensors, nonetheless, cost between $20 and $100. Your mechanic\u2019s labor costs also likely vary based on a few factors, including how difficult it is to access your sensors. Typically, labor costs for a sensor replacement are around $150.\n\nYour Next Step\n\nKeeping your vehicle\u2019s oxygen sensors in tip-top shape is critical. After all, if you have a bad or failing O2 sensor, you could get reduced gas mileage or even fail an emissions inspection.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "How Does an Alternator Work?",
        "content": "What Does an Alternator Do?\nIt may be helpful to think of your vehicle\u2019s alternator as a generator, because that is essentially what it is. In fact, automobiles up to the 1960\u2019s used a generator (which produces electricity but does so differently with different internal parts) and some vehicle manufacturers (many in Europe) still refer to a modern-day alternator as a generator. In simple terms, your car\u2019s engine delivers power to the wheels. The engine also spins the alternator through a\u00a0drive belt, or\u202fserpentine belt, and pulley system. This causes the alternator to create electrical current that is fed back in to the electrical system, and battery.\n\nHow does an Alterntor Work?\n\nThe alternator converts the rotational mechanical energy of the engine into the electrical energy your vehicle\u2019s components need to function. It receives mechanical energy from the\u202fpulley, which is rotated by the engine belt, and uses magnetism to generate alternating current. Furthermore, it changes this alternating current (AC power) into direct current (DC power) that your vehicle can use.\n\nStator:\u00a0The stator is a set of fixed or stationary wire windings. Several of these precisely spaced windings work with the rotor to generate an alternating current.\nRotor:\u00a0The rotor is the part of the alternator that spins. It is supported on both ends with bearings and spins with the assistance of a pulley and drive belt. The rotor features an iron-core center that has a copper wire wrapped around it. Energizing the wire with an electrical current causes a magnetic field with north and south poles to develop.\nBridge Rectifier:\u00a0The bridge rectifier converts the alternating current (AC) from the stator into direct current (DC) that your vehicle can use. To accomplish this task,\u00a0the rectifier has several\u202fdiodes. These diodes allow current to flow in one direction and prevent it from flowing backward. This changes the alternating current into direct current.\nVoltage Regulator:\u00a0The\u202fvoltage regulator\u202fis the nerve center of the entire assembly. It is an electronic component and is responsible for maintaining the charging system voltage within a specified range.\n\nThe Parts of an Alternator\nThe charging system in your vehicle includes the alternator and battery, but there are also other important parts that are essential to the proper operation of the alternator.\u00a0\nHousing\nThe alternator housing will have many holes and will be constructed of aluminum, so it will look silver or grey, if it\u2019s clean. Manufacturers use aluminum because it does not magnetize.\u202f\n\nPulley\nThis is the part that you will see at the front of the alternator, and it will have the serpentine belt running around it. This is what provides the spin to the rotor that generates electricity in the alternator.\n\nStator\nThe stator is the set of copper windings that sits just inside the housing and doesn\u2019t move when the alternator is running.\u202f\u202f\n\nRotor\nThe rotor is the set of copper windings that is attached to the shaft of the alternator and creates the magnetic field when an electrical charge is applied to the windings.\u202f\n\nSlip rings\nThe slip rings are two rings that sit at the end of the rotor shaft and provide a contact point for electricity to travel into the rotor and power the electromagnet.\u202f\n\nBrushes\nThe brushes are spring loaded pieces of metal that contact the slip rings so that electrical current can be transferred to the rotor for the electromagnet.\u202f\n\nBearings\nAt each end of the shaft, there is a bearing that allows the shaft to spin freely.\u202f\n\nRectifier\nThe rectifier converts the alternating current (AC) that your alternator produces to the direct current (DC) that your car needs to run its electrical systems.\u202f\n\nRegulator\nThe regulator measures the voltage that is coming out of the alternator and if it is too high, it will reduce the amount of electricity going to the electromagnet in the rotor, causing the alternator to generate lower voltage. If the output voltage is too low, it will increase the flow of electricity to the rotor, causing the alternator\u2019s output voltage to increase. It keeps the output voltage at between 13 and 14.5 volts.\u202f\n\nFan\nThe fan is located inside the housing and it draws airflow into the alternator to cool the parts and avoid overheating.\u202f\n\nSerpentine Belt\nThe serpentine belt isn\u2019t really part of the alternator, but it is a vital part of the electrical system because it turns the rotor in the alternator to generate electricity. The belt takes its power from a pulley at the bottom of the engine called the serpentine drive pulley or crankshaft pulley.\n\nIdler Pulley\nIdler pulleys are also not actually part of the alternator. They are pulleys bolted to the front of the engine that don\u2019t turn any shafts. They just help to route the serpentine belt to all the important pulleys, so if you trace the travel of your belt, you\u2019ll often see that an idler pulley makes it \u201cturn a corner\u201d.\u202f\n\nTensioner Pulley\nThe tensioner pulley is another important part of the system that isn\u2019t attached to the alternator. You will typically have one tensioner pulley and its job is to keep the serpentine belt running with the correct tension. If the serpentine belt is too loose it can cause some of the accessories to \u201cslip\u201d and not produce enough power. The belt is too tight, you can prematurely wear out the belt. Some Tensioners are spring loaded and others have to be set manually. If you are replacing your serpentine belt, the first step will be to loosen the tensioner pulley.\n\nWhat Causes an Alternator to Go Bad?\n\nMost modern alternators are well-built and can function for a long time. Still, they are not invincible. Eventually, your vehicle\u2019s alternator may require repair or replacement. Typically, when alternators fail, the culprit is one of the following:\n\nBearing failures:\u00a0The alternator\u2019s rotor relies on bearings to keep it spinning freely and smoothly. Like the bearings in other parts of your vehicle, the\u202falternator\u2019s bearings\u202fcan eventually wear out. If this happens, you are apt to hear a loud, grinding noise coming from under your car\u2019s hood. These sounds should get louder as you listen near the alternator, if that is truly the problem. Furthermore, if the alternator\u2019s bearings are well past their prime, the belt may whine, chirp or squeal.\nDamaged regulator or rectifier:\u00a0If your alternator has a damaged regulator or rectifier, you may face a variety of problems. These could include a dead battery, an\u00a0lit battery warning\u00a0or message on the instrument cluster, and dim lights when driving at night. Your vehicle may have an instrument readout that tells you how many volts the alternator is delivering. This should be between 12.3 and 14.4. If your car does not have a voltage gauge, you can use a voltage meter to test alternator output.\nBad belts:\u202fYour alternator needs the pulley and belt system to function optimally. Eventually, drive belts may fray or otherwise wear out. Regularly inspecting the drive belt for signs of wear is a good way to ensure your alternator\u2019s rotor keeps spinning properly.\nWorn Brushes:\u202fThe brushes in the alternator are wear items and eventually they do wear out. This will cause the alternator to not charge properly and can also lead to a dead battery or\u00a0lit CEL\u00a0on the instrument cluster.\nOver Heating:\u00a0Heat is a major cause of failure in alternators. The alternator has vent holes that allow heat to escape and help to prevent overheating. When vent holes are plugged by 60% or more, failure is likely to occur. Also, if the battery does not hold a charge of 12.4 volts or more, the alternator will constantly try to recharge a depleted battery. This constant charging can cause an alternator to overheat.\n\nBecause the consequences can be significant, you do not want to ignore problems with your vehicle\u2019s alternator. After all, if the alternator fails, you may find yourself stranded somewhere you would rather not be. You may also cause additional damage to your vehicle by putting off essential alternator repairs.\nAlternator Maintenance\nIf your it fails, you probably need to replace the alternator. You can, however, take certain steps to keep this part in tip-top shape.\nFirst, keep a good battery under your car\u2019s hood. Because car batteries and alternators go hand-in-hand, you should replace a old, damaged, weak, or ineffective battery. After all, a bad cell inside your battery can ruin your alternator. If you have a vehicle that doesn\u2019t get driven often, consider using a trickle-charger to keep the battery maintained during the down time. The opposite is also true. If you have a failing alternator but a good battery, your battery may disguise alternator performance issues. Eventually, though, both components are likely to require replacement. It is important to note, an alternator should NEVER be used to charge a dead battery. Any time your battery is suspect of being dead, or low on charge, always use a battery charger to complete this task. Charging a dead battery via the alternator will lead to alternator failure. Many times, this is why both failure of the battery AND the alternator can occur within weeks of each other. First, the battery fails. Then, after frequent jump starts and driving around with a dead battery, the battery is replaced, only to find out the new battery goes dead after several days, because the alternator died during this same time. It is a frequent occurrence.\n\nComing Out on Top\nNow that you have answered the question, \u201cWhat does an alternator do?\u201d you likely understand the importance of keeping your alternator in tip-top shape. If you want to come out on top, you cannot leave the health of your vehicle\u2019s alternator to chance. \nBy watching for common problems, you know when to repair or replace your alternator. If something goes wrong, you need high-quality components and the right tools to achieve success. Take a look at your alternator today.

        "title": "Forced Induction: Superchargers and Turbochargers",
        "content": "What is Forced Induction?\n\nForced induction forces more air into the engine allowing it to run more efficiently and make more power. Naturally aspirated engines (engines with no super- or turbochargers) make limited power due to air intake. Natural aspiration means that atmospheric force is responsible for pushing air into the engine. This force is about 14.7 lbs, and it varies with elevation. Turbo and superchargers have greater intake force for increased performance.\nNaturally aspirated engines tend to only make a peak volumetric efficiency of 75% to 85%. While naturally aspirated engines can make more power through other upgrades to air intake and exhaust systems, they are unlikely to make 100% or higher efficiency without the help of forced induction. Forcing more air in gives each intake cycle more oxygen, which increases power by letting the engine burn more fuel and do more work. How much more power the engine makes, depends on how much boost the forced induction system supplies.\nBoost refers to the amount of air that is forced into the engine and is measured in psi. The more boost, the more power the engine will make. That said, it\u2019s important to make sure that the car\u2019s engine and other components are built strong enough to stand up to the extra pressure. Otherwise that sweet super- or turbocharger might just blow up an engine from running it too fast. Other parts of the car may need to be modified to withstand the extra power too.\nSo, what is the difference between a supercharger and a turbocharger? Both use turbines to force air induction, but they turn the compressor a little differently. At their simplest:\n\nSuperchargers get their rotational energy from the serpentine belt or another drive belt\nTurbochargers are powered by exhaust gases\n\nBoth use turbines to force additional air into the engine, speeding up the rate of air intake and allowing the engine to consume greater amounts of air. They differ in where they get the energy that is used to rotate the turbines.\n\nHow Does a Supercharger Work?\n\nSuperchargers are mechanically driven forced induction devices. In most cases, they are driven using a pulley that is wrapped in the serpentine belt. This allows the crankshaft to turn the compressor, creating boost for the engine so it can make more horsepower and torque.\nThey aren\u2019t always driven by a belt. These are the different supercharger drive types:\n\nBelt (V-belt, Synchronous belt, Flat belt)\nDirect drive\nGear drive\nChain drive\n\nRegardless of exactly how they are driven, superchargers get their power from the crankshaft. Depending on their configuration, they can consume up to 30% of the crankshaft\u2019s energy! This makes them better suited for big engines than small ones.\nFor example: on a supercharged engine that generates 400 horsepower, the supercharger alone might consume 150 horsepower from the engine. This is a good trade-off, because it basically lets you trade 150 horsepower for 400, giving an increase in engine output by 250 horsepower. While it is a good trade, you need that 150 horsepower to spare if you\u2019re going to install a supercharger.\n\nHow Does a Turbocharger Work?\n\nTurbochargers are driven by exhaust gases. They feature two fans, a turbine and a compressor. Exhaust gas is routed through a tube in the turbo that turns the turbine, which sits in the exhaust stream. The compressor sits in the air intake, and because it is attached to the turbine, it spins with it. That\u2019s how the compressor speeds up air intake to speed up the engine.\nBecause turbos get their energy from exhaust gases after they have exited the engine, they run more efficiently than superchargers, which rely on the crankshaft. This can help them make more power on smaller engines, and it also makes them more fuel efficient. That\u2019s why turbochargers are increasingly common on economy cars and compact cars: they are one of the best ways to make more power from a small engine.\n\nOE Turbos\n\nTurbochargers have long been associated with tuned-up sports cars, but recently turbos have come as original equipment for all sorts of vehicles.\nThat\u2019s because turbos are run by exhaust gases that must leave the engine regardless of forced induction, turbos increase the engine\u2019s efficiency, and the fact that adding a turbo adds less weight than making the engine bigger does. As a result, turbocharged engines can weigh substantially less than similarly-powered naturally aspirated engines.\nThe other reason turbochargers are popular on economy cars is because of turbo lag. The turbo is driven by the engine\u2019s exhaust gases, so it doesn\u2019t kick in until enough is being exhausted. That creates turbo lag: the gap between when you first press the gas pedal and when the engine is at high enough an RPM to drive the compressor. That means that a turbocharged vehicle generates less power and uses less gas when driven at low RPM.\n\nBe Smart About Forced Induction\n\nSuperchargers and turbos are commonly added onto cars by tuners in search of more power. Cars that come turbo- or supercharged stock are designed to operate with the power that is added by forced induction. A car that you decide to install forced induction onto may not be.\nTo further complicate things, these devices can provide different amounts of boost. An OE turbo will be designed by the manufacturer to provide a level of boost at which the engine can run reliably. Whether or not the same can be said for an aftermarket forced induction set-up depends on a whole host of factors, meaning you need to do a lot of research before adding forced induction to a vehicle.\nForced induction can help the engine make more power, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. If you supply an engine with more boost than it can withstand, it can destroy the engine. Other parts may need to be upgraded to withstand the added boost too.\nThese are some common parts to be upgraded before adding forced induction:\n\nBetter Suspension: Upgrading struts, coil springs, anti-sway bars, and other suspension components can improve handling, which is crucial to keeping the car manageable when boosted\nCold Air Intakes: These give air a longer intake to travel, resulting in colder air entering the engine\nHigh Flow Exhaust: Upgrades to the exhaust system can help alleviate back pressure by letting exhaust gases flow more freely\nPerformance Fuel Injectors: These are crucial to upgrade on vehicles that do not use a carburetor. While carburetors will adjust the rate at which they let fuel into the engine automatically, modern cars need new fuel injectors so that they can maintain the ideal air-fuel ratio with the new air from the boost\nIntercoolers: Forced induction compresses air, heating up the air. Intercoolers cool off the air before it reaches the engine to keep it from running too hot\n\nWhat all needs to be updated depends on the build, and how much boost you are trying to achieve. In order to withstand higher amounts of boost, more parts will need to be upgraded to withstand the added boost. There are also many parts that are used to install forced induction parts. Often you can get everything you need at once with a supercharger kit, which includes all parts necessary for working forced induction.\nRegardless of the exact upgrades you choose to make, forced induction is a great way to increase the horsepower and torque output of a vehicle. It\u2019s important to make sure the rest of your vehicle can take the boost, but there\u2019s still no better way to make far more power than your vehicle is built for.\n\nShop Performance Parts",

        "title": "What Does It Mean To Blow a Head Gasket?",
        "content": "What Is a Head Gasket?\n\nThe head gasket acts as a seal between the head of each cylinder and the engine block. Your powerplant works by using the force of a contained combustion of fuel to drive the piston. The gasket works to contain the combustion, so your engine directs its power more efficiently. It also acts as a barrier between the fuel, oil, and coolant. Every fluid in your vehicle has its own job and mixing them \u2013 such as oil getting into your combustion chamber \u2013 could cause catastrophic problems.\nYou can think of the combustion in your engine as a mini-explosion. The head gasket has to be durable to endure millions of these explosions over its lifetime. To resist these forces, a gasket is made from steel or tough composite materials. Some high-performance models use copper to form a more complete seal that offers better heat dispersion.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of a Bad Head Gasket?\n\nBecause of the critical jobs performed by this seal, it\u2019s often easy to tell when it\u2019s blown. Look for the following signs of bad head gasket if you think it\u2019s having problems:\n\n1. The engine is overheating\n\nThis indicates that the coolant has leaked to the point where it can\u2019t effectively cool the engine. If you see your temperature gauge is unusually high or notice a service light, this could be why.\n\n2. The engine isn\u2019t performing well\n\nAs previously mentioned, the head gasket makes your powerplant run more efficiently. If the seal is loosened, you might note a rough idle and lack of power.\n\n3. The coolant is low with no obvious leaks \n\nYour antifreeze can leak into a variety of places with a blown head gasket. Because some aren\u2019t immediately obvious, you may not locate the leak until your coolant level runs low. This is another reason why checking your fluid levels should be part of your maintenance routine.\n\n4. The oil looks pale and milky\n\nWhen the barrier between your engine\u2019s fluids is compromised, it allows them to mix. As coolant leaks into your oil, it alters the color and consistency. Not only is it no longer cooling your engine, it\u2019s diluting your oil and making the lubricant less effective.\n\n5. The tailpipe is producing white smoke\n\nWhen coolant leaks into your combustion chamber, it produces steam. The white smoke coming from your exhaust is actually water vapor and glycol.\n\n6. The exhaust manifold has coolant leaking below it\n\nWhen the antifreeze is leaking outside the engine, it can create a small puddle on the ground. The color and smell will help you differentiate it from water produced by condensation.\n\n7. The radiator or overflow tank has air bubbles in it\n\nIf the gasket between the coolant passage and combustion chamber fails, air can be pushed into your cooling system. A particularly large air pocket could even block coolant from circulating.\n\n8. The spark plugs are fouled\n\nWhen the coolant gets into the combustion chamber, it can cause problems with your spark plugs. In rare cases, this could even cause misfires. This could be a symptom of other issues, so look for other signs of a blown head gasket.\n\nEven if these symptoms don\u2019t point to a bad seal, you should get them checked out. These are all signs of a major issue with your vehicle.\n\nCan You Drive With a\u00a0Blown Head Gasket?\n\nAs indicated by the symptoms above, it\u2019s not unusual to drive with a bad seal. While you can continue to use your vehicle, you should avoid doing this unless absolutely necessary. A busted head gasket will only get worse, damaging more systems as it continues to fail. As poor temperature regulation is one of the side effects of this problem, your car can eventually sustain severe damage from an overheated engine.\n\nHow Much Does a Head Gasket\u00a0Replacement Cost?\n\nThe price of this repair can vary a lot from vehicle to vehicle. Even high-quality copper gaskets are relatively inexpensive, making the actual replacement part the cheapest aspect of the process. As with many automotive repairs, the bulk of the cost actually goes to labor. The overall price depends on many factors including the severity of the damage, number of cylinder banks, presence of overhead cam VS pushrods, and other parts damaged.\nIf you\u2019re a veteran mechanic with an extensive tool collection, you likely feel comfortable tackling this job. For those of you who aren\u2019t, this fix should be left to the pros. Drivers are better served focusing their efforts on preventing blown head gaskets.\n\nHow Do You\u00a0Prevent a Head Gasket From Blowing?\n\nOne of the most common causes of this issue is overheating the engine. Previously, it was discussed that copper is a high-performance gasket material because of its heat dispersal properties. This is because high temperatures can damage the seal. Ensuring that you have adequate coolant levels can help prevent this. Regular oil changes and using an oil grade rated for your environmental conditions will also help with this.\nIf your vehicle has a turbocharger or supercharger, keep your combustion chamber pressures low. These mods put a lot of stress on the gasket, which can eventually cause it to blow. Leave the boost level at the factory setting to prevent excessive chamber pressure.",

        "title": "What Does Oil Do for a Car's Engine?",
        "content": "What Does Motor Oil Actually Do?\n\nWhat does Motor Oil Do?\nTo understand the function of motor oil, it\u2019s first important to at least get a basic understanding of how your engine works. You don\u2019t need to get too technical to really understand what oil does: rather, the most important thing to understand is that there are many moving parts inside your engine. These moving parts not only rub against each other, they also produce a great amount of heat.\nEssentially, motor oil acts as the lubricant that allows all of these moving parts inside your engine to rub against each other and not overheat or wear out quickly. If you were to try and drive your car with no motor oil inside of it, very quickly, that heat and friction would cause the engine to weld itself into a useless piece of metal. When this happens to a car engine, the engine seizes or \u201clocks up.\u201d Once an engine is locked up, there\u2019s basically nothing that can be done to fix it. Other than, of course, replacing the entire engine.\nObviously, most motorists want to avoid this, and thus ensure that their car has sufficient motor oil to coat and protect its moving parts against excessive wear.\nIn addition to the heat generated from all of the moving components of the engine rubbing against each other, engines run off of a process called internal combustion. This process of combustion produces a lot of water vapor, carbon, acids, and several other byproducts.\nWay back in the day, engines actually didn\u2019t have an oil pump to help move the oil around the engine. Rather, they used a very rudimentary system of dippers on the crankshaft which would then splash oil upward and cover the moving parts of the engine with oil. (Many lawn mowers still operate this way.)\nHowever, this process is obviously imperfect, and usually would result in a locked up engine after a period of time. Over time the process of\u202foil delivery\u202fdid improve, but it also took a while for\u202foil filters\u202fto start showing up on automobiles; they were still considered an option well into the 1950\u2019s. What a filter does is help remove unwanted particles from the oil, such as carbon and metals. Prior to the addition of oil filters, older engines would need to go through a process known as \u201cde-coking\u201d in order to remove the build-up, which would settle in the oil pan, or anywhere motor oil could pool.\n\u201cDe-coking\u201d would involve running a mixture of diluted kerosene and oil through the engine as a flush, and hope that it would help remove some of the carbon and sludge buildup. However, this was also not a very precise process or thorough process, and normally wouldn\u2019t do much, if not damage the engine. Thus, prior to modern oils now have detergents to battle this, along with oil filters. In the \u201cgood old days\u201d, engines would rarely make it over 100,000 miles without needing to be rebuilt. Anyone who has cracked open an older engine from the 1950\u2019s to the 1970\u2019s usually has a story about \u201cthat one engine\u201d that had enough sludge in it that it was a wonder it ever ran at all.\nBasically, your car\u2019s engine is a very complex place, and, due to the movement and heat generated by the process of combustion, a very dirty place. Not only does oil lubricate the parts inside of your engine to ensure overheating does not occur, it also helps to keep the engine clean.\n\nDoes Switching Between Conventional and Synthetic Oils Cause Problems?\n\nOriginally, all motor oils were mineral-based. After years of development, synthetic blend oil started to appear on the market. For a while, it was \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that switching to a synthetic oil after using mineral-based oils in an engine would result in problems like burning oil or potential leakage.\nAt this point, these theories have all but been disproven. (This is similar to how some people swear up and down that manual cars get better gas mileage as compared to automatic cars. This may have had plausibility at one time, but not so much anymore.) In fact, synthetic motor oil is actually better than conventional oil in a multitude of ways.\nFirst of all, synthetic oil has a higher percentage of purity as compared to conventional oils. Conventional oils are going to have a certain amount of impurities by its very nature: for example, paraffin molecules. On the other hand, synthetic oil is pure all the way through. This means lubricity is better, and ultimately longevity is better.  \nAdditionally, synthetic oil was invented for the sole purpose of having an oil that could maintain a better viscosity in extreme cold and hot temperatures. All oils are going to thicken up drastically as the temperature plummets, but synthetic oils will maintain a better viscosity at these extreme temperatures, and adversely, in extreme heat, will resist vaporization better.\nParticularly if your car is a more modern model, it\u2019s important to go with synthetic oil. This is because synthetic oil has much greater shear strength as compared to conventional oil. Basically, if there is enough pressure, the very molecules of conventional oil can be torn apart. This doesn\u2019t happen with synthetic oil, and given the very tight tolerances of modern engine build, this strength factor is paramount for peak engine performance and protection.\nNo matter what kind of vehicle you own, it\u2019s very important for the engine to have an appropriate amount and variety of motor oil. Failure to have enough can result in engine lockage, meaning that you\u2019ll have a very expensive mess on your hands. Make sure to change your oil and oil filter regularly for top performance.",

        "title": "Motor Oil: What Do Grades Mean For Your Engine?",
        "content": "What Are the Numbers on an Oil Container?\n\nThe numbers indicate the oil grade, which is a measure of its viscosity. A layman can think of viscosity as a liquid\u2019s thickness. Consider the difference between pouring a glass of water versus waiting for the ketchup to slide out of the bottle. Ketchup has a high viscosity whereas water has very low viscosity.\nNow imagine trying to put a number on the difference between the thickness of ketchup and water. This was exactly the problem faced by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) with oil viscosity. The SAE\u2019s solution was the measure the rate at which oil traveled through a standardized opening at specific temperatures.\nThe grades you see on bottles represent the measurements based on flow time. It\u2019s not as simple as saying \u201chigher numbers are better\u201d because some oils perform better at different temperatures than others. The oil you want depends on your vehicle and the environment in which you drive.\n\nWhat Does the W Mean?\n\nWhile many drivers think it means weight, the W in the grade actually stands for winter. The first number can be thought of as the oil\u2019s cold-temperature performance. Oil thickens as it becomes colder, making it harder to pump through your engine. Pancake syrup is an excellent visualization here as it\u2019s fairly thick when cold but almost water-like when hot.\nThe difference in the viscosity is the reason you see multiple numbers on grades, such as 5W-30. The number preceding the W is a measurement of the oil\u2019s flow at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The lower the first number is, the better the oil flows at below freezing temperatures. So 0W-30 would be a better cold-weather lubricant than 5W-30.\nThis is important because if oil becomes too thick it becomes almost impossible for your system to pump. A sudden surge of cold, thick lubricant can put a hole in your filter, preventing it from cleaning your oil properly. If no oil is pumped at all, you experience a catastrophic engine failure. Always use the correct winter ratings when driving in a cold environment.\n\nWhat Does the Number After the Dash Mean?\n\nWhile engines are always hot when they run, hot weather puts even more stress on your oil. In the cold, having a thin oil prevents your car\u2019s lubricant from becoming too thick. High temperatures thin out your oil, necessitating a higher viscosity. If oil becomes too thin, it doesn\u2019t clean your engine well. The debris in your system causes poor performance and gas mileage. Even worse, thin oil doesn\u2019t absorb enough heat, which can cause your engine to overheat and fail.\nThink of the number after the dash as the oil\u2019s high-temperature rating. In this case, the SAE measures the time it takes for the oil to travel through an opening at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the second number of the grade is, the better the oil stands up to heat. Using 20W-50, for instance, would be an excellent choice if you lived in the tropics.\nThat\u2019s why 5W-30 is one of the most commonly used lubricants. In temperate regions, such as most of the United States and Europe, it works well whether you\u2019re driving in the summer or winter. This is why multi-grade oils have become so popular in recent years: they provide better overall protection than monograde lubricants.\n\nWhat Does It Mean When There\u2019s No Dash?\n\nIf you see a rating such as SAE 30, this is a monograde oil. Chances are this bottle is not designed as an automotive lubricant. All modern engines use oil whether they\u2019re on cars or not. Some don\u2019t need the advanced lubricants used by today\u2019s automobiles. Riding mowers, generators, and chainsaws can run just fine on monograde oil.\nYou may be wondering, \u201cCan you use SAE 30 motor oil in a car?\u201d The answer is that this type is generally suitable only for antique cars. Even if it rarely gets cold near you, it\u2019s best not to risk your engine during an early morning ignition. Multi-grade oils protect your vehicle and help it to work better as well.\n\nWhat Kind of Oil Should I Buy?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about the exact temperature of your driving environment every time you buy oil. Your car or truck has all the info you need about purchasing oil in its service manual. It should tell you the exact type and grade used by your engine. It may even have recommendations for cold- or hot-weather oils if you\u2019re doing some traveling.\nIf you live somewhere with wide temperature swings, don\u2019t fret about finding the perfect lubricant.\n5W-40 oil works well in freezing or sweltering conditions, so it\u2019s always a good choice provided it matches your engine. Even if it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t forget that you change your oil multiple times during the year. This gives you the opportunity to switch grades to match the next season\u2019s weather.\nWhile motor oil grades can be surprisingly complex, finding the right one is fairly easy. As long as you check your owner\u2019s manual you should get the right lubricant. If you\u2019re interested in saving money, do your own oil changes. Not only is it much cheaper, you get a better feel for the condition of your vehicle. Oil replacements are the most important kind of regular maintenance on your car, so it\u2019s a good idea to take charge of them yourself.

        "content": "How Vehicle Starting and Charging Works\n\n1. The battery supplies power to your vehicle\n\nThe starting battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The three essential parts for this conversion are the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte.\n\nThe anode is the negatively-charged side of the battery\nThe cathode is the positively-charged side\nThe electrolyte is a buffer that separates the anode and cathode\n\nChemical reactions inside of the battery cause electrons to build up in the anode. Like with magnets, the similarly charged particles repel one another, but in a battery the electrolyte blocks these particles from merely switching sides by moving over to the opposite side.\n\n2. Battery cables and terminals carry current from the battery\n\nBattery cables connect the battery\u2019s terminals to the vehicle. One end of each cable is connected to either the negative or positive terminal.\n\nThe other end of the negative cable is often connected to the engine or somewhere on the vehicle\u2019s frame\nThe positive cable\u2019s other end is typically connected to the starter or a fuse box\n\nBecause the electrolyte keeps the charged particles from crossing the battery, electrical current moves from the battery, through the cables, and into the vehicle.\nCorrosion and loose connections can keep your cables from working the way they should. Be sure to inspect your cables for looseness or corrosion from time to time. If you have a problem, it\u2019s easy to tighten the cables or to remove corrosion with a wire brush.\n\n3. Relays, fuses, and the starter receive electrical current\n\nThe moment you turn the key to start in your car (or push the button) a signal is sent to a relay, or series of relays. The main relay in this group is referred to as the starter solenoid. The signal, coming from the ignition, is low amperage. When it hits these relays, and the starter solenoid, this engages a high-amperage current which directly engages the starter.\nYour vehicle\u2019s relays and fuses regulate current in the electrical systems.\n\nA relay is basically a switch that allows small currents to control accessories that would require heavy switches and wiring. Relays reduce the amount of wiring needed by having larger contact areas that can handle large amounts of current. The starter solenoid is generally one of the largest relays in your car because it handles such a huge amperage amount.\nMany vehicles have fuses in-line in their ignition system as well or a main battery or system fuse. These are often seen mounted either directly on the battery cable, or nearby in the engine\u2019s fuse/relay compartment.\nFuses protect your vehicle\u2019s electronic devices and wiring. If something like, say, your radio tries to draw too much current, the radio\u2019s fuse will blow, cutting off the current\u2019s path to the radio. This prevents the excess current from damaging the radio or melting wires in the system.\n\nAfter reaching the relays and fuses, current continues to the vehicle\u2019s various electrical systems.\n\n4. The starter turns the engine\n\nWhen the starter solenoid engages, the starter\u2019s gear, or \u201cbendix\u201d moves out to engage the flywheel or flexplate of the engine, turning it over. The turning of the engine allows the fuel air-mixture to enter into the engine cylinders for combustion, starting the engine.\nA clicking noise when you turn the key is a good indicator of low battery voltage that is sufficient enough to engage the relays, but not enough to turn the motor. Often times, you will hear a buzzing sound. This sound is your starter solenoid not fully engaging because of low or insufficient voltage. Or, in some cases, a click indicates that your starter has gone bad. In these cases, a visual inspection and/or removal and bench testing is needed, which AutoZone provides. If the starter is soaked with oil contamination and requires replacement, be sure the oil leak is repaired to prevent damage to the replacement starter.\n\n5. The accessory belt or serpentine belt drives the alternator\n\nOnce the engine is turning, rotational force from the crankshaft turns the belt pulley. The belt transfers this rotational force to other systems, like the power steering pump, the water pump, and most importantly for this article: the alternator.\n\n6. The alternator recharges the battery\n\nThe alternator is responsible for 2 things at the same time. It supplies voltage power to everything your car uses while it is running. While doing this, it also sends charge to the battery to maintain its charge as well, and in doing so, the battery acts as a capacitor. An alternator works no different than a windmill or turbine, generating AC power, which is then converted to DC power inside the alternator. The 3 items responsible for this inside the alternator are the rotor, stator, and rectifier. The alternator works similarly, except it is turned by the belt rather than a hand or the wind. The two components responsible for generating electricity are the rotor and the stator:\n\nThe rotor features magnetized finger poles that rotate surrounding the wire field winding. Each finger pole is a different length to produce alternating north and south poles for the winding.\nThe stator is just enough larger that the rotor can spin without touching the stator walls.\nA rectifier is in a sense a valve. It converts AC power (Alternating Current) into DC power (direct current).\n\nThe spinning magnetized poles generate current in the winding, and this current provides the power that charges your battery. Inside your alternator, a voltage regulator makes sure that this voltage is maintained at a proper level for your car\u2019s electrical system. This is usually somewhere between 14-16 volts.\nTest your alternator using an alternator/battery tester or voltmeter (Learn how to test an alternator here). Ensure the drive belt is in good condition and does not slip on the alternator pulley. A dead battery, one that won\u2019t stay charged, or headlamps and interior lights that appear dim can indicate that your alternator is possibly bad. Visually inspect your alternator for signs of the problem. If the alternator is replaced, be sure the battery is fully charged before starting the engine. This will prevent overload and potential damage to the replacement alternator. If the drive belt shows signs of wear, replace it to ensure the alternator will perform properly. If equipped with an automatic belt tensioner, inspect it for wear and binding/sticking. If it does not move smoothly it should be replaced along with the belt.\n\nRemember that AutoZone can help with any of your Battery, Alternator, or charging system needs through replacement parts or testing.

        "title": "Do You Need Lead Substitute?",
        "content": "Why Was Leaded Fuel Used?\n\nIn the 1920\u2019s, car manufacturers began frantically looking for a substance that could stop engine pre-detonation (knock, or pinging) and finally settled on Tetraethyllead\u202f(commonly styled\u202ftetraethyl lead), and abbreviated\u202fTEL. This lead worked to do several important things and became the standard for gasoline for half a century. It worked well, and it was the cheapest solution at the time:\nLead helped reduce knocks or \u201cpinging\u201d. Lead massively raised the octane levels of gasoline, and it needed to be once engines in the late 1950\u2019s started to ramp up compression ratios in the never-ended horsepower race, while still operating on very primitive ignition systems.Lead minimized wear and tear on the car\u2019s valves and valve seats by reducing microwelds between the seat and the valve.\nWhat are microwelds? The combustion chamber area is the hottest place inside the engine, as is the area near the exhaust valve, where hot exhaust gases exit. As these valves open and close, fusion between the two can happen in the form of small micro-welds, that then rip apart the moment the valve is opened again. Over time, this deteriorates the valve and the valve seat, until it can no longer seal, and a valve job must be done. Lead stopped or slowed this process by providing a barrier between the seat and the valve.\n\nHow Long Has Leaded Fuel Been\u00a0Off the Market?\n\nPeople first began to understand just how toxic lead really was by the middle of the 1950\u2019s, but it wasn\u2019t until the 1970\u2019s and the creation of the EPA that were these dangers acted upon. In addition to the health and environmental hazards it posed, it was also found that lead didn\u2019t gel well at all with catalytic converters and could drastically affect their function. The state of California was the first to officially decide leaded fuel was a no-go back in 1992, and once that happened, it didn\u2019t take long at all for the rest of the country to follow in its footsteps.\nIt\u2019s important to note though, that by the mid-1970\u2019s, most vehicles were being manufactured to accommodate Unleaded fuel as the EPA phase-out of leaded gas began in the 1970\u2019s. The main change happened in the form of valve seats that were hardened, more durable, and better able to resist the effects of the high temperatures responsible for the formation of microwelds. Unleaded gasoline no longer posed a threat to engines at all once those standards became mainstream, but even throughout the 1980\u2019s, the common theme was which pump to use at the gas station \u2013 Regular or Unleaded?\n\nDo You Need Lead or Substitute in an Old Car Today?\n\nThe answer to this question is a bit of raging debate, and it has more to do with the presence of hardened valve seats in the heads of any engine built prior to 1980. See, many engines of old have been rebuilt at one point or another over the course of 40-80 years. During that time, having the cylinder heads rebuilt is very common, and one of the most common upgrades done at that time is to add hardened seats into the heads. Once this is done, the need for any lead substitute of any kind is moot.\nIf you are unsure about whether or not your car\u2019s engine, or heads have been rebuilt and hardened seats have been added, then decisions can be made, and even here, debate still rages. Many older classic cars are not driven much, and when they are, they aren\u2019t driven far, or worked hard, which is why many machinists and engine rebuilders will tell you that hardened seats aren\u2019t necessary, and simply running a lead substitute or even nothing at all but regular 93 octane will suffice just fine. Many other machinist and engine builders will insist that whether it\u2019s a weekend cruiser or a daily driver hauling things, to put hardened seats in when you rebuild the heads.\nIn the meantime though, in any of these cases, lead substitute is something that can help. Keep in mind this also does not mean that failure to run a lead substitute is going to lead to disaster. As stated before, many older classic cars are not run hard, nor on long road trips or grueling work where cylinder head temps even reach the point where micro-welds could occur. Because of that, there are tons of old cars still cruising the roads, without hardened seats, running on unleaded gasoline without issue. But, if you are concerned, remember that running lead substitute isn\u2019t going hurt \u2013 it will only help.\n\nIs It Still Possible To\u00a0Buy Leaded Fuel?\n\nOf course, you may simply be asking: \u201cWhere can I buy leaded gas?\u201d After all the real thing has got to be better for your classic car than a substitute, right? To answer that question: you\u2019re not going to be able to roll up to a gas station and buy leaded gas anymore. Technically speaking, it does still exist and is permitted in specific types of vehicles (like aircraft or farm vehicles, to name two examples). It\u2019s no longer legal to put leaded gas in your car though, whether it\u2019s a classic or not.\nDon\u2019t even think about trying to do it on the downlow either. If you\u2019re found to be driving a car with leaded gas in the tank, you could well wind up slapped with a hefty $10,000 fine for your ingenuity. In other words, lead substitute is really the only acceptable alternative.",

        "title": "How to Test Ignition Coils",
        "content": "Types of Ignition Coils\n\nIgnition coils come in various types of ignition systems, but all of them take energy from the battery (usually 12 volts) and convert it to a high enough voltage (50,000 volts or more) to create a spark. Depending on the type of coil you have, this voltage either travels from the single ignition coil into a distributor, from the coil itself into a spark plug wire, or in the case of Coil-On-Plug (COP) systems, the coil sits directly on top of the spark plug. Older vehicles with a distributor have a single coil which provides voltage to the distributor. DIS, or wasted spark systems, use what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccoil pack\u201d to send voltage to each spark plug wire, where other vehicles use a single coil for each spark plug wire. Most newer vehicles now incorporate COP.\nRegardless of how many coils your vehicle has, you\u2019ll need some basic tools to properly test a coil:\n\nA basic tool kit to remove coils\nA multimeter or an ohmmeter\nSpark plug or ignition tester\n\nIgnition coils fail in 2 ways \u2013 either complete failure and lack of output, or intermittently, meaning, the coil gets weak, output gets low, or the coil sometimes works and sometimes doesn\u2019t. Because of this, intermittent problems are more difficult to diagnose. You\u2019re going to want to do your initial diagnosis by looking for common bad ignition coil symptoms, because you need to remove the coils before testing them. That way you can save yourself some time if you find that the symptoms don\u2019t match up. These are the symptoms of a bad ignition coil:\n\nMisfires \u2013 Check Engine Light: Misfiring is usually the first and most common symptom, and in most vehicles today, this will appear as a Check Engine Light. The misfire will either be on a particular cylinder, or random. Most of the time, specific-cylinder misfires become easier to diagnose than the random-cylinder. If the car is running rough, stumbling, or lacking acceleration, and a check engine light code is revealing a misfire, an ignition coil or coils may be the culprit.\nRough Idling or Hesitation Under Load: As stated before, most ignition problems that are misfires also cause a rough or bad idle, but in cases where a vehicle (mostly older vehicles) does not have a Check Engine light or ability to detect a misfire, a rough idle or constant stalling of the vehicle may indicate a bad ignition coil, or a coil that is over-heating, whereas hesitation under load could also be a sign of a weak coil.\nNo-Start Situation: When a vehicle has a no-start situation, especially on older vehicles, the ignition coil is the first thing some people turn to. This often is not the culprit, as there are many other pieces of the ignition system, but even on modern vehicles, there are cases where a coil can fail between the last run cycle and the next start-up. In these cases, the vehicle may have ran fine, then on the next start, suddenly either won\u2019t start, or runs horribly. Either way, the ignition coil, or coils could be suspect.\n\nTesting Ignition Coils\n\nCommon Check Engine Light Causes: Ignition Coils\nThere are several key things to know first about testing ignition coils. For one, there are many different methods for testing them, some low-tech and others high-tech, and we will cover them all. \nIt\u2019s important again to remember that most coil failures are intermittent, which make them more difficult to diagnose. It\u2019s also important to note that many ignition systems, most notably DIS or \u201cwasted spark\u201d coil pack systems, and several COP systems use a processor, or \u201cIgnition Module\u201d to properly power and send signals to the ignition coils. While these issues may appear that the coil isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s actually the Ignition Module causing the problem. Below we will highlight several different methods for diagnosing coil issues.\n\nHow to Test Ignition Coils\n\n1. Swapping Coils\n\nSwapping the ignition coil with another known, good unit on the car is the easiest and simplest way to begin diagnosis and works extremely well on any vehicle with single coils, multi-packs, or Coil-on-Plug.\nAs mentioned before, in these cases, you will usually have a misfire on a particular cylinder. In this case, let\u2019s say you have a cylinder 3 misfire on a vehicle with Coil-on-Plug packs. Simply remove another coil \u2013 say \u2013 the coil from cylinder 6, and swap with the coil from cylinder 3. Now, if you have a code reader, you can clear your engine codes. If not, take note of which engine code you had. \nNow, start the vehicle and run for several minutes. If the ignition coil was indeed faulty, you will now see an engine code for \u201cMisfire \u2013 Cylinder 6,\u201d as the defective coil from #3 was moved to #6. Your next step is to pull the #6 coil you just moved and replace. \nIf you swap these coils and still have a misfire on cylinder 3 and it doesn\u2019t move, you know the coil is not the suspect. You either have an Ignition Module issue (some COP units use a module, some don\u2019t), an issue with the coil\u2019s connector or lead, you have a spark plug issue, a fuel injector issue, or mechanical internal engine issue with that cylinder.\n\n2. General Inspection\n\nOn any coil \u2013 look it over carefully for signs of cracks, burns, melting, or leakage in older canister coils. This often points to a problem on its own, so check carefully.\n\n3. Test the Windings with a Multimeter\n\nTesting coils with a multimeter for Ohm\u2019s resistance has been around for a long time. While it works to some degree, a major issue is that you are not able to simulate load, or measure the coil during operation, so weak coils that are not performing may still pass this test, but still be bad. \nNonetheless, testing the coil\u2019s windings for proper resistance can help you find potential problems. Each ignition coil consists of two separate coils wrapped around each other: the primary winding and the secondary winding.\n\nCheck your vehicle\u2019s specific repair manual, or online to find out what the correct resistance reading should be for both the primary and secondary windings. Both must be tested.\nConnect the multimeter\u2019s positive and negative leads to the corresponding terminals as instructed for testing Primary and Secondary windings. Different coils will have different touch-points depending on how the coil is designed. Your repair manual, or online information should tell you exactly where and which pins to touch off to.\nCheck the reading on the multimeter and compare it to the resistance specifications for both the primary and secondary windings.\n\nIf the reading falls outside the normal resistance range, you\u2019ll need to replace the ignition coil. A zero means the coil shorted internally. An excessively high reading means the coil is open. Double check the placement of your leads to be sure they are correct.\n\n4. Spark Test or Active Analysis\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that many times when a coil fails, it becomes weak. It still produces spark, and may still run the vehicle fine at times, but often under load, or acceleration, it can produce a misfire. Other times, the coil completely fails and stops working altogether. Doing an actual, on-vehicle spark test or output test is sometimes the only way to validate what is going on without simply replacing parts and hoping. It\u2019s worth noting, that with any Coil-on-Plug vehicle (COP), that the ignition coil swap highlighted in step #1 is usually the quickest and easiest way to determine you have a coil problem.\nA spark test or active analysis of the coil\u2019s operation while on the vehicle can be performed with a number of different tools or procedures. Keep in mind, with any of these, you are often going to be testing the coil\u2019s output while the vehicle is running, so review any spark test procedures either in a repair manual, or online tutorial. Simply yanking off coil wires while the vehicle is running can result in you getting shocked or seriously injured. You can also research a method known as the \u201cpower balance test\u201d to help isolate where you have a cylinder issue. We will highlight several different style coils and basic methods of how you can test those, along with the tools for doing so:\n\nAn inline ignition tester like OEM 25227 can be helpful. This unit runs inline with many spark plug wires and/or coils and gives you a window to see active spark.\nAn ignition spark tester like OEM 25069 takes the place of a spark plug \u2013 is grounded to the engine and can easily show you whether a particular wire or coil is providing spark.\nThere are several new technology items, like a COP or coil on plug testers, which use inductive technology to tell that a coil is firing properly without even removing the coil. There are also several small, affordable oscilloscopes, along with tutorials online and on youtube on how to use them, that show you how you can pinpoint bad coil output without even removing the coil or wires.\n\nNow, let\u2019s cover different types of coils, and diagnostic methods to pinpoint an issue.\n\nCoil-on-Plug (COP): You will recognize these coils immediately as they sit directly on top of the engine\u2019s valve or cam cover, are bolted down, and attach directly to the spark plug via a rubber boot. The easiest and best method to pinpoint a problem on these coils is to do the #1 method of swapping the coil with a neighboring coil to see if the misfire moves to a different cylinder. If you suspect the coil is dead, you can also remove the coil, plug it back in, and use an ignition spark tester like OEM 25069 to determine if the coil is firing. You can also use a multimeter to test resistance. Individual coils for each cylinder that attach with a spark plug wire, similar to the LS motors used on Chevy and GMC trucks, can also follow this method.\nDIS (Wasted Spark) Coil Packs: Coil packs were the norm of ignition systems for well over 2 decades. These units use either a single pack or series of packs that have tower terminals that spark plug wires hook to. They often have pairs of the terminals that fire in unison, where one cylinder fires on the compression stroke and one is wasted on the exhaust stroke of another cylinder, giving it the name \u201cWasted Spark\u201d ignition. They are usually powered and controlled by an Ignition Module, which can also fail. Sometimes, a pair of terminals can go out on the pack, and other times, just a single terminal running a single cylinder can fail. If your system is composed of several of the same packs (like a V6 engine with 3 packs, each having 2 terminals) you can also do the #1 \u201cswap\u201d method and move the coil pack to a neighboring position, and see if the misfire moves to those cylinders. You can also test with an ignition tester like OEM 25227. In this case, it\u2019s good to compare the intensity of the spark with a cylinder you know is good and working properly, with one that\u2019s suspected of being bad. If you notice the spark is considerably weaker, the chances are the coil is bad and needs to be replaced. There are also methods of testing the windings on these coils with a multimeter, but they can get complex as you have multiple terminals and towers to test.\nTraditional Single Coil: The single-terminal \u201ccanister\u201d coil has been around in one form or another since the 1920\u2019s. While they are not used on vehicles today, there are millions still on the road in vintage vehicles which use a distributor. Testing these coils for resistance via a multimeter is a good start, along with doing an inline spark test to be sure the coil is firing properly. Keep in mind, many of these coils can suffer intermittent problems, especially from overheating or vibration and your resistance test will not necessarily lead to a proper conclusion. Luckily, most of these coils are rather affordable, and often times if you are dealing with a pesky intermittent problem and all testing hasn\u2019t led to a conclusion, swapping the coil with a known good unit may be the best course of action.\n\nDiagnosing coils or the ignition system can sometimes be difficult. Simply swapping parts to diagnose the problem can sometimes be costly and ineffective. Professional shops often have a series of expensive, state-of-the-art equipment to help with these processes, and often giving them an opportunity to diagnose the problem ends up being more cost-effective and less time consuming.

        "content": "Understanding the Error\n\nThe first question you probably have is, \u201cWhat does the code P0017 mean?\u201d To start, you need to understand what the camshaft and crankshaft are. Both of these parts relate to the cylinders in the car. The camshaft opens and closes valves, which let an air/fuel mixture into the cylinders. Next, a spark causes this mixture to combust, which drives the cylinders. Finally, the crankshaft translates the force of the cylinders into a circular motion, which can be used to turn the wheels. The camshaft, crankshaft, and sparks all need to be working in perfect sync for the engine to function properly. The P0017 error code indicates that there is a problem with the synchronization of these parts.\nThe error code P0017 specifically refers to Bank 1 Sensor B. This information helps you understand the exact part that is not working properly. Many engines have multiple banks, each containing some of the cylinders. To know what Bank 1 Sensor B means for your vehicle, you will need to consult a diagram of your engine.\n\nThe Symptoms\n\nIf there is a problem with the synchronization of your crankshaft and camshaft, the vehicle will suffer from many obvious symptoms, including:\nVery poor performance Difficulty starting the vehicle A rattling noise while running \nKeep in mind that these symptoms will be in addition to the illuminated check engine light. If the error code was given by a faulty sensor, then you will not experience any of these symptoms.\n\nThe Potential Risk\n\nHaving the cylinders run out of sync may prevent you from operating your vehicle at all. If it does continue to run, its performance will deteriorate more and more until either the vehicle no longer runs or the problem is fixed. If you ignore the issue, it will likely cause even more damage, meaning you will have to spend more money to fix it. If you happen to be driving when the engine fully gives out, it may cause an accident.\nAgain, if the code is due to a faulty sensor, then you are not in any real danger. However, if something does go wrong with your crankshaft and camshaft, then you will not know due to the faulty sensor.\n\nThe Solutions",

        "content": "What is Zinc, anyway?\n\nZinc is the only element that starts with Z, and it\u2019s a vitamin listed on food packaging, which are the two things that make it the most famous. It\u2019s also used to fight corrosion, as a galvanizing agent, is critical to create brass, and shows up in thousands of compounds that affect your everyday life. Check out the Zinc wiki page with 270+ sources to read up on all that.\nWe\u2019re here to talk about motor oil. \n\nWhat does Zinc have to do with motor oil?\n\n\u201cZinc\u201d in motor oil usually is describing a compound called  Zinc Dialkyl Dithiophosphates or ZDDP. According to Valvoline, \u201cits primary role is to prevent metal-to-metal contact between engine parts by forming a protective film. Despite being referred to as zinc, ZDDP also contains phosphorus, which helps to perform the anti-wear function in the motor oil.\u201d\nZinc acts as a friction inhibitor, and research suggests that older engines using \u201cflat tappet\u201d lifters in the engine (pretty much any V6 or V8 older than 1988) need to have zinc present in the engine oil in order to keep the camshaft and lifters from wearing prematurely.  \n\nSo why isn\u2019t Zinc or ZDDP in modern motor oil?\n\nHerein lies the problem. About 10 years ago, it was also discovered that in general oil consumption, Zinc, especially the phosphorus present in ZDDP, is a primary cause of premature catalytic converter failure. With the government setting mandates on manufacturers covering the service life of catalytic converters over 100,000 miles, this caused nearly every oil manufacturer over the last 10 years to slowly remove zinc from the ingredients in their oil. Diesel oils soon followed suit, until today, no oil that is approved for on-road use contains Zinc. This of course doesn\u2019t affect newer engines with roller lifters or overhead cams at all \u2013 but for older engines \u2013 it limits the options for oils with ZDDP.  \nCurrently, very few oils on the market contain zinc \u2013 and all of these are designated as \u201coff-road\u201d oils, such as Valvoline racing oil. However, if you\u2019re looking to add Zinc, there are of Zinc additives, that, when coupled with your favorite oil, provide the protection you need.  \n\nZinc is not only critical for older flat-tappet engines, but many argue it\u2019s critical for new engine break-in. An engine\u2019s break in period is critical for its long-term success, as everything from main and rod bearings, to rings, cams and oil pump are getting adjusted to their new life.  Remember, if you have an older vehicle, whether it\u2019s a 1966 Mustang or a 1979 Ford pickup, it\u2019s a good idea to put zinc into the oil. \nMore on Synthetic and Conventional Oil\nNeed Zinc additive or oil advice?

It has one heated wire and one ambient temperature wire. The microprocessor inside the MAF sensor measures the air entering the engine by maintaining the temperature of the hot wire 200\u00b0F above the ambient incoming air. The energy required to maintain the sensor at the same temperature is calculated and sent to the powertrain control module (PCM).

YOUR CAR HESITATES OR SUDDENLY JERKS FORWARD WHILE ACCELERATING\n\nA bad MAF sensor can cause your vehicle to experience poor drivability issues such as engine stalling, jerking or hesitation during acceleration. This could happen while speeding up on the highway on-ramp or cruising down a city street. These issues can create dangerous situations causing accidents and injury. If you experience any of these symptoms you should examine your vehicle as soon as possible.\n\n2. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO RICH\n\nYour vehicle needs the proper ratio of fuel to air in each combustion cylinder. Running rich means there is too much fuel and not enough air. Signs that your vehicle is running rich include:\n\nBlack smoke exiting the tailpipe\nWorse fuel efficiency than usual\nRough idling\nCheck Engine Light\n\n3. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO LEAN\n\nRunning lean is the opposite of running rich. It means your vehicle has too little fuel and too much air. Similar to running rich, the MAF sensor is sending inaccurate information to the PCM. This time underestimating the amount of airflow instead of overestimating it.\nAlthough this will temporarily improve your fuel efficiency, running lean for too long can seriously damage your vehicle. You may experience:\n\nEngine hesitation and/or surging\nHard engine seizures\nHard starting\nCheck Engine Light\n\nAs with other MAF sensor problems, the solution may be as simple as cleaning the wires. However, it\u2019s also a good idea to have a mechanic check your vehicle for damage.\n\n4. YOUR OBD-II SCANNER GETS\u00a0CODE P0101\n\nIf your\u00a0Check Engine Light is on, use a code reader to see what diagnostic trouble codes the system puts your way. If you don\u2019t have a code reader, stop by AutoZone to use our free Fix Finder program.\nThis Code\u2019s full read out is: P0101 \u2013 Mass Air Flow Sensor Circuit Range/Performance.\nThe engine computer uses the MAF sensor signal to determine how much fuel needs to be injected to meet the proper air-fuel ratio. The MAF sensor signal is also used to calculate engine load, meaning it can cause trouble for the traction control system, or change the automatic shifting pattern in applicable vehicles. This code is most commonly caused by a dirty, obstructed, or faulty MAF sensor, but can also be caused by issues including:\n\nDamage to the intake boot\nVacuum leaks\nClogged or improperly installed engine air filter\nClogged-up cat converter or restricted exhaust\n\nBecause there are other potential causes besides the bad MAF sensor, it\u2019s worth looking into these other possibilities so you are positive this code is being caused by the sensor before you go about replacing it.\n\nA malfunctioning MAF sensor may cause your vehicle to jerk during acceleration, run too rich, or run too lean. Make sure to fix the problem right away so you can be safe, avoid costly repairs, save money at the pump, and avoid being stranded on the road. Be sure to take a look at the mass air flow sensor before replacing it, you may only need to clean your MAF.

        "title": "How to Replace a Serpentine Belt",
        "content": "What is a Serpentine Belt?\n\nThe serpentine belt is aptly named for the way it snakes around the pulleys inside the engine bay. This long, winding rubber belt powers many of the important systems of your vehicle by transferring power from the engine\u2019s crankshaft to the accessory pulleys. These pulleys rotate to power components like the alternator, power steering pump, and air conditioner. In some cars, it even powers the water pump in the cooling system.\n\nHow to Replace Your Serpentine Belt\n\n1. Note the placement of belt\n\nSerpentine belts have that name for a reason. They snake in and out of a series of pulleys and peripherals, and the path they weave through is unique to your model vehicle. To preserve the belt\u2019s position, take a few snapshots from different angles or sketch the way it winds through the engine. If the belt is already out of place, locate the driver\u2019s manual or the under-the-hood placard, where you\u2019ll find a sketch of the routing.\n\n2. Loosen and unthread the belt\n\nBefore removing the belt, you\u2019ll need to release the tensioner, which automatically keeps the belt taut while you\u2019re driving. Tensioners usually have one of two ways to release tension. Many have a \u00bd\u201d square cast into the tensioner arm, in which you insert a \u00bd\u201d breaker bar, or Belt Tensioner Tool to relieve the tension. Many others, you use a socket on the pulley itself to do this. Use a ratchet or breaker bar that fits into the bolt and release the tensioner. Then unroute the belt carefully, taking care not to disturb or damage the network of pulleys and peripherals.\n\n3. Check for damage\n\nAfter removing the belt, inspect it for signs of damage. Many belts wear out over time, but some wear down due to misalignment or other issues. Misalignment won\u2019t resolve itself when you replace the belt, so determine whether this is a problem. Look for disintegration along the edges and separated ribs, both of which are signs that you have misalignment on your hands. Use a straightedge to make sure the pulleys are aligned correctly, and then remove any old dirt and grime from the pulleys. This is a good time to look for oil leaks, too. Oil can increase wear on serpentine belts. Most importantly, take the tensioner pulley and any idler pulleys (these are pulleys that do not drive anything, like Power Steering) and give them a spin. Listen carefully. They should spin freely and make no noise. Grab each pulley and check for any side to side, or in and out movement. Any excessive movement of any of these pulleys, or noise, and they should be replaced. If these pulleys fail while on the vehicle, your belt will fall off, and you will be running without a water pump (in most cases), power steering, and an alternator, so check them carefully!\n\n4. Install the new belt\n\nWhy is My Engine Squealing?\n\nIn all likelihood, it\u2019s probably not your engine that\u2019s responsible for all the racket. Squealing from the engine bay probably comes from a worn out belt. It could be a drive belt or serpentine belt. When rubber belts start to wear out, they slip and slide. This makes a squeaking or squealing sound. Ever notice how your tires screech and squeal when they lose grip? It\u2019s the same thing with your car\u2019s belts. When you hear this sound, you\u2019ll want to get the belt replaced immediately. If the belt is worn enough to slip, it\u2019s going to start wearing out faster. If it breaks, the broken belt could flip around in the engine compartment and potentially cause major damage to your vehicle.\n\nWhat Happens When the Serpentine Belt Goes Bad?\n\nSerpentine belts don\u2019t need to be replaced particularly often. Most last for around 50,000 to 100,000 miles. Consult your owner\u2019s manual maintenance section for replacement intervals. When you notice one of these four signs, it\u2019s time for a new serpentine belt: Serpentine belt transfer power from the engine\u2019s crank shaft to the engines alternator, power steering pump, smog pump*, and air conditioner compressor. This one belt provides power to all the vehicles components. Some vehicles have a dedicated belt for the alternator just in case the serpentine belt should break. The vehicle can continue driving until it reaches a safe place to stop.\n\nSquealing from power steering or air conditioning:\u00a0The serpentine belt controls peripherals such as power steering and air conditioning, and these devices take a lot of torque from the belt to turn, so if you turn the wheel, or turn on the AC and hear squealing, the chances are, your belt has worn.\nWear and tear:\u00a0If a visual inspection of the serpentine belt reveals significant wear and tear, including cracks, separation, or damage, it\u2019s time for a new belt.\nSquealing noise under the hood:\u00a0This may signal that the belt is slipping. Sometimes a new belt is not needed. The belt is kept tight through the belt tensioner. The tensioner is a self-adjusting pulley that maintains pressure on the belt to reduce slipping. At times, the bearings in the tensioner pulley become worn. This causes the squealing noise. Check these bearings when performing a belt change.\n\n*if equipped\n\nHow Long Do Serpentine Belts Last?\n\nSerpentine belts can last for years and might only need to be changed once or twice over the life of the vehicle. The recommended industry standard is to inspect your belt at 60,000 miles for wear & tear and replace if necessary, and\u00a0replace every 90,000 miles\u00a0regardless of the appearance in order to reduce the chances of a breakdown.\nLike anything else in your vehicle, it is not indestructible and will eventually falter. If you keep your car long enough, or if it\u2019s an older model, be prepared to replace it as belts will succumb to heat and friction over time. The best way to determine when yours should be replaced is to check your owner\u2019s manual for the service interval.\n\nWhat Does a Worn Belt Look Like?\n\nWear and tear, as well as extreme temperatures, will take a toll on the serpentine belt at some point. Years of use could cause the belt to crack or wear unevenly. It\u2019s a good idea to periodically check the belt or have a mechanic inspect it for you during routine car maintenance. Keep in mind that serpentine belts don\u2019t show cracks like their predecessors. Newer belts wear more like tires, so you\u2019ll need to look for rib material deterioration. Other signs of problems are damaged ribs or rib separation. Your mechanic can let you know when to replace the serpentine belt or how many miles it has left.\n\nLook on the inside of the belt (the ribbed side that touches the pulleys on the alternator, water pumps, and other engine accessories). If you notice the ribs cracking, the ribs are worn away, or you notice any other substantial belt wear, it\u2019s time to change the belt.\nIf you have a recurring issue where your belt frequently breaks, or it breaks long before it should have, it is possible that an issue like pulley drag, obstruction or debris in the engine bay, or contamination of the belt and pulley from leaking oil or coolant.\n\nListen for Clues\n\nYou may not have to lift the hood and look for visible evidence of a worn-out serpentine belt. Sometimes, your ears can be your ally. Like many other parts and components on your vehicle, when the serpentine belt nears the end of its life, you may start to hear strange noises. Belt problems aren\u2019t limited to wearing out, breaking, or contamination of the pulleys and belt. Some may slip, causing significant problems with your vehicle. When this happens, you may hear a chirping or squealing sound. This could also indicate that the belt has stretched out and that there is a tension issue. The pulley system that operates the mechanism of the belt may also be failing.\n\nWhat Happens When the Belt Breaks?\n\nIf you\u2019re like many other drivers, you\u2019ve probably driven farther than you should when parts or systems are going out. With some components, you can get away with keeping your car on the road for a little while. However, if your serpentine belt breaks completely or falls off, you won\u2019t have any option but to replace it.\nWhen your belt fails, everything that it is driving stops functioning. In most cases, this is the alternator, water pump, and power steering pump. Usually the first one you feel is a lack of power steering. Your battery light will also illuminate, as your alternator has stopped working. Lastly, your engines temperature will very quickly rise, as your water pump has stopped working. It is extremely important to understand that the moment you have seen any of these symptoms, pull over immediately! Quickly get your vehicle into a parking space away from congestion if you are not on the highway. If you determine that your belt has broken, you cannot continue to drive the vehicle. The vehicle will overheat within a matter of minutes, and at that point, you risk the possibility of warped heads, blown head gaskets, and damage that is far, far worse than a tow bill.\n\nThe Cost of Replacing the Belt\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a bad serpentine belt, don\u2019t hesitate to get a new one. This will give you the peace of mind you need to get back on the road safely. Just think, the next time you purchase a belt may be the last time you\u2019ll ever have to do so on that vehicle. More good news: serpentine belts are inexpensive compared to other car parts and components. A professional mechanic will normally charge between $75 and $120 in labor to remove the old belt and replace it with a new one. If you\u2019re thinking about doing this work yourself, make sure you understand the process. You don\u2019t want to drive around with an incorrectly installed serpentine belt. If you need help changing the belt,\u00a0search through our list of local Preferred Shops in your area.\nWhen you\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat of your vehicle, you probably don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about the serpentine belt. As you understand more about how this rubber component powers your vehicle, you\u2019ll start to appreciate it more. Keep your eyes and ears out for the signs of a damaged belt so you\u2019ll know when you need to remove it and put on a new one. You can then continue driving safely, and your car\u2019s reliability will improve.

        "title": "What Are Head Gasket Sealants?",
        "content": "What Head Gasket Sealants Do\n\nThese sealants are designed to fix head gasket failures, but using a sealant isn\u2019t the only way to address a failure. You can use a torque wrench to tighten the cylinder head bolts or change the head gasket altogether. Because the the head gasket is between the cylinder head and the engine block, replacing it can be complicated and require disassembling major engine components. Using a head gasket sealant is the easiest fix. This liquid stop leak is made to track down the source of a leak and fix it quickly so you can get back behind the wheel in less than an hour.\n\nSigns of a Blown Head Gasket\n\nA mayonnaise- or milk-like mixture in the oil: An off-white creamy appearance on the dipstick signals that the coolant has probably mixed with the oil. This can also be caused by a leaking intake manifold gasket. If the intake gasket is OK, consider changing the oil and replacing the head gasket(s) altogether\nUnresponsive engine: One of the most common signs of a head gasket approaching failure is a slow or unresponsive engine\nWhite smoke coming from the exhaust pipe: White smoke can show water from the coolant is leaking into the combustion chamber\nBlue smoke coming from the exhaust pipe: Blue smoke often signals oil is leaking into the combustion chamber\n\nUsing head gasket sealant is relatively easy. Always read the instructions on the bottle. You may see some variety, but most sealants follow similar steps.\n\nHow To Use Head Gasket Sealant\n\n1. Mix the product\n\nShake the bottle to mix the sealant.\n\n2. Flush the radiator\n\nUse distilled water or a flushing agent until the draining fluid appears clear. This is especially important if the system is dirty, such as if coolant and oil have mixed.\n\n3. Determine how much sealant you need\n\nIt will vary depending on the number of cylinders.\n\n4. Prepare the radiator\n\nFill the radiator with water, but leave an appropriate amount of room for sealant.\n\n5. Warm up the vehicle\n\nLet the vehicle idle a few minutes and turn the heater on high to get the engine nice and warm.\n\n6. Pour in the head gasket sealant\n\nAdd the sealant slowly and replace the radiator cap. (Note: Some vehicles do not have radiator caps.  The fluid and sealant are added through the radiator over flow reservoir.)  Let the vehicle idle for about 45 minutes while monitoring the temperature gauge and ensuring that the temperature stays within the normal range.",

        "title": "Camshaft vs. Crankshaft: What They Are and What They Do",
        "content": "What Are The Crankshaft and Camshaft?\n\n1. Camshaft In Depth\n\nA camshaft is a long, metal rod with a series of external objects attached to it. The most notable are the egg-shaped lobes, which drives the opening and closing mechanisms for intake and exhaust valves. These lobes are precisely placed and specifically timed to make your engine function correctly and exactly as the pistons cycle through the combustion process.\nMany modern engines feature a dual overhead cam design, where two different camshafts sit on each side of the engine, with one camshaft controlling the opening of the intake valves, and the other camshaft controlling the timing of the opening of the exhaust valves. More cams doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better, it\u2019s just a different design. Many engines operate terrifically with a single camshaft, and there are a few quad-cam designs, or engines with four camshafts.\nHowever many are featured in your engine, they are controlled by a series of belts, gears or chains to ensure precise timing. Late model vehicles incorporate a Variable Valve Timing Solenoid that adjusts the camshaft lift and duration based on engine demands. \n\n2. Crankshaft In Depth \n\nWhile the camshaft helps your engine create power, the crankshaft takes that power and gives it to your vehicle. Another long, metal rod, your crank shaft looks a little bit like the middle of a Jenga game, with its webs, pins and connecting rod journals giving it an uneven appearance. Each of these components connects with its own connecting rod which attaches to the piston, taking the power generated from the piston\u2019s motion and transferring it to your transmission for your car to use.\nWith big words, it converts reciprocating motion (the up and down of the pistons) into rotational motion (the spinning of the camshaft into the transmission). Like the camshaft, the crankshaft\u2019s timing is managed by a belt, gears or chain. Keeping the timing components in good shape, is the best practice thing you can do to maintain proper engine timing.\nIf you have a major problem with either your crankshaft or camshaft, your engine probably won\u2019t run. But if you\u2019re hearing a squealing sound coming from under the hood, it\u2019s likely a timing issue related to one of the timing components that control these rotating elements.",

        "title": "Synthetic Oil vs. Conventional Oil -- Which Is Better?",
        "content": "What Should I Put In My Car?\n\nSynthetic and Conventional motor oil will both protect your engine, but synthetic oil will do it as much as 47% better* and resist breakdown under extreme temperature conditions. As with most maintenance, best practice is to follow the advice in your owner\u2019s manual. If your car does not absolutely require a certain type of oil, you can choose between the products based on performance and cost. While synthetic motor oils tend to be more expensive, they are shown to reduce buildup of sludge and operate more efficiently under extreme temperatures. For cars with over 75,000 miles, be sure to use a high mileage oil.\n\nBetter Protection For Longer\n\nJust like conventional oil, synthetic motor oils act as a barrier, protecting your engine components. When battling heat and friction, over time the additives in both oils will begin to break down, reducing their ability to protect your engine.\n\nReady to Go In, Hot or Cold\n\nSynthetics provide better cold weather protection through faster oil flow at start up. They also tend to resist breakdown better in high-heat situations, like summer or high-performance conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s Still About a Fit\n\nIf you\u2019re thorough and consistent about changing your oil on time, conventional motor oil will protect your engine. If you\u2019re looking for a product that is less likely to break down, or you\u2019re living and driving in a place with some major cold or extreme heat, synthetic oil can provide peace of mind along with superior protection. And if you\u2019re driving a performance vehicle, synthetic oil is almost always recommended.\n\nBetter for Turbo\n\nMany modern engines utilize a turbocharger for additional power, making heat resistance demands higher. Synthetic oil protects these components better.",

        "title": "What are Bad Spark Plug Symptoms?",
        "content": "Signs to Tell If Your Spark Plugs Need to Be Replaced\n\n1. Visual Inspection\n\nRemove and compare your old spark plugs to a new one. If the tip and/or electrode show excessive wear they should be replaced. Also, look for fuel and oil contamination. If contamination is found, the spark plugs should be replaced. However, additional inspection is needed to determine the cause of the contamination whether it is caused by oil, fuel, or coolant. Failing components within the engine itself can cause oil or coolant contamination. Fuel contamination can be caused by failing components within the fuel, ignition and/or emission systems.\nPro Tip: The following are symptoms that may occur with worn spark plugs. Keep in mind, there may be other issues causing the problem. Be sure and do a complete inspection before replacing any parts.\n\n2. Trouble Starting\n\nIf you are experiencing what seems to be longer cranking times, especially on a cold morning, you\u2019ll want to look at your spark plugs and related ignition and fuel system components. Over time, spark plugs develop residue from unburnt gases and oils, which reduces your car\u2019s performance and makes cold-starting more difficult. Tough cold starting is not only bad for your engine, but can also drain the battery and increase starter wear and tear.\n\n3. Rough Idling\n\nIf your vehicle\u2019s engine is running rough or noisy when idling, you likely have a problem in your ignition system. Heavy rumbling when waiting at a stoplight or in a drive-thru may indicate your car is overdue for maintenance. It may be a spark plug issue, but it could just as easily be another component like ignition coils causing the problem. Inspect the system and determine if the spark plugs or something like the ignition coils and wires need to be replaced. Make sure that you diagnose the issue before you go about replacing parts, otherwise you could end up wasting time and money.\n\n4. Misfiring\n\nMisfires are hard to miss, as the engine will shake so badly that you\u2019ll feel the vibration throughout the car. Misfiring results in poor performance, reduced fuel economy, increased emissions, and rough idling. Replacing spark plugs may help with this issue but, as above, inspect the system first.\n\n5. Decreased Fuel Mileage\n\nLow gas mileage is a subtler sign of worn spark plugs. Deteriorated spark plugs can account for as much as a 30-percent loss in fuel economy, which you\u2019ll definitely feel at the pump and your wallet. If you\u2019ve checked and determined the fuel mileage has dropped, check your spark plugs and related items for signs of wear.",

        "title": "How to Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "HOW TO CHANGE SPARK PLUGS\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and ensure the engine is cool. Clean the engine area of any dirt and debris to prevent anything from falling into the engine cylinder during spark plug replacement. Additionally, you may want to disconnect the battery (negative post only). Check the vehicle repair guide or other resources to ensure no damage will occur if the battery is disconnected for any length of time or if any modules or other items would need to be reprogrammed. Ensure the positive and negative terminals do not become crossed with a foreign object such a hand ratchet and cause a dangerous short circuit.\n\n2. REMOVE THE SPARK PLUG WIRE\n\nFirst, remove any interference items. If your vehicle requires removal of the upper intake plenum, a new gasket will be needed. After gaining access, you will likely find the rubber spark plug wire end and inside metal terminal somewhat difficult to remove from the spark plug. You must be careful to avoid damaging the rubber boot or tearing the wire terminal away from the plug wire end. If you discover the plug wire boot is \u2018stuck\u2019 to the spark plug try using spark plug wire pliers to aid in removal. The boot may need to be twisted back and forth to break the bond from the spark plug. Again, be careful. The metal terminal that connects to the spark plug inside the boot must be removed simultaneously with the boot to avoid damage. If damage to the boot or wire occurs, don\u2019t feel bad. In many instances, even a professional is unable to remove them without damage occurring. If damage does occur, the wire(s) must be replaced. Re-installing a damaged boot or wire will cause a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the spark plug wires are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. A new plug wireset will ensure the newly installed spark plugs will receive all the necessary firepower from the ignition coil(s).\n\n3. REMOVE THE COIL ON PLUG (COP)\n\nCOP designed coils attach directly to the spark plug end and use a long rubber insulator boot. Start the removal process by disconnecting the electrical connector from the ignition coil. Press down or pull up on the locking tab to make the connector release so it can be disconnected. A small screwdriver may be needed to help depress the locking tab. Once the connector is off, remove the hold down bolt and carefully twist the coil about a quarter turn or so back and forth until the \u2018bond\u2019 is broken. Then it should pull straight up and out. Use caution! There is always a risk of damage to the COP boot. COP coils and their insulator boots are made of plastic and rubber that protect and insulate the high voltage conducting materials inside. Damage will cause the high voltage to leak (short) to ground causing a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the boots are damaged they must be replaced. Just like spark plug wires, if they are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. Check the COP boots for signs of engine oil or engine anti-freeze contamination. Oil puddled in the spark plug well hole is usually caused by a valve cover tube seal and/or leaking O-ring. The appearance of coolant in the plug well can be caused by a leaking heater or by-pass hose or even the intake manifold gasket. These leaks should be repaired first, especially if severe, to prevent damage to the new components.\n\n4. UNSCREW THE SPARK PLUG\n\nBe sure the engine is cooled off. Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs. Avoid thread damage by following these suggested steps. On COP applications remove debris by blowing air down into the spark plug well hole. Even the tiniest of particles can build up in the threads of the spark plug during removal and cause damage to the cylinder head threads. If this occurs, sometimes a spark plug thread restorer tool may be used to do just that, restore damaged threads in the cylinder head. Next, loosen/turn the spark plug about a half a turn counter-clockwise and blast a small shot of penetrant fluid to the base/ thread area of the spark plug. Allow a few minutes to soak. On some engines, the manufacture may provide additional removal steps. Check the repair guide. Take note it you feel considerable resistance while turning the spark plug counter-clockwise. You may need an additional small amount of penetrant and soaking time. If you encounter resistance, turn the spark plug clockwise and carefully work it back and forth. If the plug just won\u2019t co-operate, you should probably stop and seek a professional\u2019s help. Damaged cylinder head threads can often be expensive to repair, depending on your vehicle.\n\n5. PUT IN THE NEW SPARK PLUGS\n\n6. RE-INSTALL THE SPARK PLUG WIRES OR IGNITION COILS (COP)\n\nApply a small amount of plug wire grease to the plug wire boot (or COP boot) and re-install each plug wire or ignition coil. Be sure and connect the plug wires to the appropriate spark plug for each engine cylinder (refer to a firing order diagram if necessary). Re-install the coil hold down bolt(s). Re-attach the electrical connector(s). Re-install all other components removed to gain access. Be sure and gather up all tools and the engine is free and clear to start. Remember to re-connect the battery if it was disconnected at the beginning.\n\n7. START UP THE ENGINE\n\nStarting the engine after the spark plug replacement is a good way to validate your work. Note: If your Check Engine Light is on, you can drive your vehicle to your local AutoZone store and have the code translated. If the Check Engine Light \u2018flashes\u2019 there is a cylinder miss-fire. Re-check your work. Do not drive the vehicle very far if the engine is missing as the\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0could be damaged.\nYou may need to\u00a0gap your spark plugs\u00a0before installing them. Some plugs come pre-gapped, and if this is the case it will say so on the box. Otherwise you\u2019ll need a gap tool to gap your new plugs according to the specifications in your owner\u2019s manual. Most modern cars use plugs made from long-lasting materials, so you might only need to do a spark plug replacement once or twice over the time you own a vehicle.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "content": "Check if your car has a Karman-Vortex air flow sensor. These are found in some Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Lexus vehicles and can\u2019t be cleaned with MAF Sensor Cleaner.\n\nHow to Clean a Mass Air Flow Sensor\n\n1. Unplug the Sensor\n\nTurn the engine off, remove the keys from the ignition, and let the engine cool. Locate the mass air flow sensor by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. Unplug the part from the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.\n\n2. Remove the Sensor\n\nWith the sensor unplugged, loosen the clamps and any brackets holding it in place. Slide the sensor assembly away from the tubing and carefully remove from the air intake boot(s).\n\n3. Clean the Sensor\n\nPlace the sensor on a towel for cleaning. Apply the cleaner \u2014 10-15 blasts around the inside of the sensor will do. Also clean the sides of the part, its housing, its connectors, and its terminals. If you have a hot wire mass air flow sensor, make sure the cleaner doesn\u2019t get onto the hot wires or plate.\n\n4. Reattach the Sensor\n\nAllow the sensor to dry. This should only take a few seconds. Once the part is ready, you can re-install it back into place, reattach and tighten the clamps/brackets.

        "title": "How to Change a Radiator Valve",
        "content": "How a Radiator Valve Works\nThe design of a car thermostat is simple yet effective. It typically consists of a cylinder made of metal or plastic that contains a temperature-sensitive element filled with wax, a spring, and a valve.\nThe temperature-sensitive element contains wax that expands when it gets hot and contracts when it cools down. This movement of the wax element is transferred to the valve through the spring. When the engine is cold, the spring holds the valve closed, preventing coolant from flowing to the radiator.\nAs the engine warms up, the wax element expands, pushing against the spring and eventually causing the valve to open. This allows the coolant to flow through the radiator and regulate the engine temperature. That\u2019s usually around 180 F, give or take. The thermostat also has a bypass that allows a small amount of coolant to circulate even when the valve is closed, helping to warm up the engine more quickly.\n\nWhat Goes Wrong with a Thermostat?\n\nSeveral things can go wrong with a thermostat or radiator valve, including:\u00a0\nThere are several things that can go wrong with a car thermostat:\n\nSticking open. Coolant will continually circulate through the radiator if the thermostat sticks open, causing the engine to run colder than it should. This can reduce fuel efficiency and performance and even cause you to fail a smog test.\nSticking closed.\u00a0 Coolant would not circulate through the radiator if the thermostat sticks closed, causing the engine to overheat and leading to engine damage or other components.\nWorn spring. Over time, the spring inside the thermostat can weaken. The thermostat can fail to open or close as needed.\nWax element failure. If the wax element inside the thermostat becomes damaged or leaks, it will not be able to expand and contract properly.\nBlocked passages.\u00a0 Dirt, rust, or other debris can accumulate in the passages and prevent proper coolant flow.\n\nSteps to Change a Radiator Valve (Thermostat)\nChanging a thermostat or radiator valve is usually a straightforward procedure that a novice DIYer will be comfortable taking on. Depending on the location of your engine, it can take 30 minutes or less, or it could take a few hours. You first need to locate where the thermostat is located, usually at the upper end of the engine block under the housing neck where the radiator hose connects to. Some thermostats are more complex and integrate the housing, a coolant sensor, and one or more water outlets.\n\nFrom there, collect your tools. You\u2019ll need the following:\n\nA flat screwdriver\nA ratchet and socket set\nRadiator hose clamp pliers\nA drain pan\nEngine coolant\nA new thermostat and gasket\nHand and eye protection\n\nBefore opening the cooling system, let the engine cool for 30 minutes to an hour. Otherwise, hot coolant or steam can escape and seriously burn you or others nearby.\n\n1. Drain the coolant\n\nPlace your drain pan or bucket under the petcock valve on the rad. If your radiator doesn\u2019t have a drain on it, position the bucket under the lower radiator hose. Open the valve or remove the hose from the radiator and drain the coolant.\n\n2. Remove the thermostat housing\n\nThere may be a  few parts, ducts, or engine covers that need to be moved or removed to get at the thermostat housing. Once you have access, remove the hoses with your hose clamp pliers or a screwdriver and pull the hoses free. You may need to use a flat screwdriver to work the hoses off of the outlets. Then, unbolt the thermostat housing from the engine block.\n\n3. Replace the thermostat\n\nWith the housing removed, you should be able to see the thermostat if it\u2019s a separate part. It\u2019s slightly UFO-shaped with a flat ring that has a gasket on either side. Some radiator valves are integrated into the housing and are replaced as an assembly. Clean the mounting surfaces for the engine block and the thermostat housing well with the thermostat removed. Install the new part, being sure the thermostat is oriented correctly for coolant flow.\n\n4. Re-install the thermostat housing\n\nInstall the housing with new gaskets in place, then tighten it according to the manufacturer\u2019s spec. Sources like ALLDATA can provide the correct specification.\n\n5. Add engine coolant\n\nAdd a 50-50 mix of distilled water and concentrated engine coolant into the radiator. Ensure the coolant you choose is the correct type for your car\u2019s make to prevent unintended reactions.\n\n6. Bleed the air from the cooling system\n\nStart the engine and let it run for a few minutes, checking for leaks. Then, turn off the engine and allow it to cool. Check the coolant level and add more if necessary.\n\nHow to Maintain a Radiator Valve and Identify Problems\n\nHow can you prevent thermostat issues? The most important thing you can do is change the engine coolant according to the maintenance schedule. If the coolant isn\u2019t strong enough or it\u2019s become acidic, it can lead to blockages or corrosion on the thermostatic radiator valve.\u00a0\nIt might be too late if you have these symptoms:\n\nA Check Engine light illuminated with temperature-related DTCs\nThe temperature gauge reads too high or too low during normal operating conditions\nYou\u2019ve noticed overheating symptoms regularly without signs of a head gasket leak or water pump problem\nYou aren\u2019t getting enough heat in the cabin on cold days\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Why is my car overheating?",
        "content": "What causes engines to overheat?\n\nCommon cooling problems\n\nHopefully, you will never be in a situation where you have to ask why is my car overheating, but if you do experience an overheated engine, it will probably be one of the following causes.\n\nImproper coolant/water mixture\n\nLow coolant\n\nLow coolant level can be caused by cracks in the radiator, loose hose clamps within the system, or a worn-out hose. You can look for small or large puddles of coolant under your vehicle after it\u2019s been parked for several hours if you are attempting to diagnose this issue.\nCheck out this resource on how to check your coolant level.\n\nBad Thermostat\n\nYour vehicle has a thermostat in the cooling system that allows water to pass through when engine temperatures rise. If the thermostat is faulty, it won\u2019t allow coolant to flow through and you can experience overheating. Some vehicles even have two thermostats, so check your vehicle documentation if you suspect this issue.\n\nFailed water pump\n\nThe water pump on your car pushes water through the engine and cooling system to create the cooling cycle. Water pumps do wear out eventually, so this is a repair that is common with vehicles over 100,000 miles.\u00a0\n\nBroken radiator fan\n\nMany older vehicles have belt-driven radiator fans, but almost all newer vehicles use small electric motors to drive the radiator fan. The fan will cycle on and off during driving, depending on the requirements of the cooling system, but if the vehicle is parked and running, the fan should be running if the engine is hot or overheating.\n\nBroken Belt\n\nMany modern vehicles use either the serpentine belt or another belt to drive the water pump. If the water pump belt fails, you will experience overheating quickly.\n\nLow engine oil level\n\nIf your engine does not have enough oil to lubricate its parts, then there will be a massive increase in friction and a corresponding increase in heat production. Check your oil level and ensure that it is not black and that it\u2019s full. Extremely black oil is a symptom of oil that needs to be changed.\n\nSymptoms of an overheating car\n\nThe first and most obvious symptom of an overheating car will be the engine temperature warning light on the dash. This is a red warning light that looks like a thermometer floating in wavy water. If you see this light, you should pull over immediately and shut off the engine to allow it to cool off.\nIf you miss the warning light, you may end up with a few of these other symptoms:\n\nSteam emanating from under the hood\nA hot engine hood\nThumping sounds coming from the engine\nReduced engine power\nCoolant on the ground underneath the car\u00a0\n\nWhat to do when your car overheats\n\nThe first step with you suspect that your engine is overheating is to pull over safely and shut off the engine. If there isn\u2019t a safe space to pull over immediately, shut off the air conditioning and turn the heating up to maximum to draw heat from the engine. Pull over as soon as it is safe to do so, as you could do serious damage to the engine if you continue to drive when it\u2019s overheating.\nOnce you\u2019ve pulled over, allow the engine to cool with the hood down for a period of time, just in case the engine is very hot or steam is coming out, which could burn you.\nOnce you\u2019ve allowed the engine to cool and you have opened the hood, find the engine coolant reservoir and if it is a see-through material, check to see what the level is. If you notice that it is low, you may have to add coolant before continuing. Be careful not to take off any radiator caps or open coolant reservoirs when the car is still hot, because this could lead to serious burns.\n\nHow Can I Prevent an Overheated Engine?\n\nYou\u2019ve learned what causes a car to overheat, but how can you prevent this in the first place? Start by checking your coolant levels regularly and use an antifreeze/coolant tester to ensure that your coolant has the proper concentration. It\u2019s also a great idea to do a visual inspection of your hoses and clamps every few months and perform a coolant flush according to your manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\nGet all your antifreeze and coolant at Autozone.

        "title": "Your Antifreeze/Coolant Questions Answered",
        "content": "What Kind of Engine Coolant\u00a0Should I Use?\n\nAntifreeze is really divided into 2 different types \u2013 IAT and OAT antifreeze. IAT (inorganic acid technology) antifreeze is the green antifreeze of old, and the universal standard for over 70 years. During the late 80\u2019s, cars began using more and more aluminum parts in engines, and the need to come up with a better, longer lasting antifreeze led to OAT (organic acid technology) antifreeze. While any IAT green antifreeze can be mixed with other green, mixing OAT antifreeze with other types is not recommended. Many manufacturers developed their own blend of OAT antifreeze, with less of more silicates and phosphates, and in doing so, developed a specific color of antifreeze to identify it. You should check your owner\u2019s manual, to check on what type or color of antifreeze your car takes. One of the most common, and longstanding coolants of this type is DEX COOL\u00ae, which was developed by GM in the late 1980\u2019s and has been used ever since. You can find out more about the\u00a0history and details of different types of antifreeze here!\nOf course, there are specialty formulas available, and understanding the options there could make your car ownership experience a lot better. Some examples of special variants you might find useful under the right circumstances include:\nCold weather protection to -34 degrees is available from many manufacturersAntifreeze that is non-toxic to animals is also very popularSome coolant manufacturers offer extreme heat formulas similar to their cold weather options\nIn the end, as long as you are choosing a formula that is compatible with your vehicle, what\u00a0antifreeze\u00a0to use is largely dependent on your needs.\n\nWhat Kind of Coolant\u00a0Does My Car Need?\n\nAre Basic Antifreeze Formulas\u00a0the Same?\n\nPrestine and BlueDevil Antifreeze\nAlmost every antifreeze chosen by OE designers is 95 percent ethylene glycol, but the additives vary a lot from manufacturer to manufacturer and provide each brand and variant with its unique characteristics. The practice of following the recommendations is one of using the antifreeze that tested best under controlled conditions.\n\nHow Often Do I Need To\u00a0Change My Coolant?\n\nA full coolant replacement is generally recommended every three to five years or 100,000 \u2013 150,000 miles by manufacturers, depending on the model, but sometimes these intervals are shorter for older automobiles. OAT antifreeze was formulated to have a much longer life than IAT antifreeze. You can check the specific gravity and color of your coolant to see if it is time. You\u2019ll need a\u202ftest kit\u202fto do it yourself. Most of the time, coolant is good longer than the estimate in the owner\u2019s manual, but sometimes it breaks down early and you lose performance. That\u2019s why regular checks on the coolant will serve you better than an estimate in time or miles. You can get a longer lifespan out of extended life varieties, with some formulas boasting life expectancies as high as five years. If you are curious about extended life varieties, check out whether your manufacturer has made any recommendations about a maximum life formula in addition to the OEM one.\n\nDo I Need To\u00a0Add Coolant Regularly?\n\nHow to flush and fill your coolant\nIn an ideal world, no. Theoretically your coolant system should be self-contained, reusing the same fluid until it breaks down enough you need to change it. The way things usually work, though is that the system has an\u202foverflow tank\u202ffor a reason, and sometimes it overflows. If the level is slightly too high at a a normal temperature you should be fine. If you\u2019re in extreme heat and temperatures get slightly above optimal, you could also lose coolant you normally depend on due to volume changes.\nChecking the coolant on a regular basis will tell you whether you need to add it, as well as how well it is working. Most people will find they only rarely have to add coolant when a vehicle is new, but as cars age many start to have lower efficiency cooling systems. Preventive maintenance and good upkeep in general can both help slow down this process, and a full vehicle restoration can turn back the clock if you are dedicated to preserving a vehicle.\n\nDoes Antifreeze\u00a0Do Anything Else?\n\nYes! Besides cooling your car\u2019s engine and keeping it from freezing, antifreeze acts as a liquid that resists corrosion, whereas pure water would corrode engine parts and not properly lubricate the moving water pump. That\u2019s why you should always use the mixture recommended in your manual, and why it\u2019s important to keep the coolant at optimal levels.\n\nThe Car Is Losing Antifreeze?\u00a0Is There a Leak?\n\nThere are many reasons a vehicle could lose antifreeze, including overflow and evaporation if a cap is loose. If you continue to lose a steady amount of coolant, check carefully around the engine compartment for drips and leaks, and find the front of the water pump to check if the water pump itself is leaking. If you want to find where you\u2019re leaking from, a drop cloth under the vehicle can help pinpoint the leak because it will show a stain where the antifreeze drips. If no leak is found, this is normally a sign of a\u00a0head gasket leak\u00a0that could be leaking coolant into either the combustion chamber or into the oil itself. Either way, the system should be properly pressure-tested and checked for leaks, and a head gasket / internal leak.\nConsulting a professional for hard to pinpoint leaks can save you time, but coolant system diagnostic guides are out there for the dedicated do-it-yourself enthusiast. Remember to follow all the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for replacement, including the replacement of\u202fhoses\u202fand valves at the recommended times. This will help prevent leaks from developing, and it\u2019s much easier than troubleshooting the system for a bad seal or a leaky hose. The best part is, refreshing the system will help it hold on to that efficiency new cars have, so it\u2019s easier to ask your engine to perform at a higher level for longer.

        "title": "Understanding Different Types of Antifreeze",
        "content": "Types of Antifreeze\n\nThe first thing to understand is the different basis for certain types of antifreeze.\nTraditional antifreeze (the old green stuff) is known as IAT antifreeze, which refers to Inorganic Acid Technology. It was fortified with silicates and phosphates, which were used primarily to keep corrosion down within the system. This was especially important when the primary item that coolant was protecting from was rust in cast iron in engine blocks, heads, and other engine components in the cooling system made from iron.\nDuring the 1980\u2019s \u2013 as more and more vehicles began to use aluminum parts and rubber seals in the system, more problems began to occur. For example, silicates caused massive amounts of scale in the system when in contact with aluminum, further causing cooling issues. Phosphates on the other hand, over time, dried and corroded anything rubber \u2013 like water pump seals. The life of IAT antifreeze breaks down heavily around 36,000 miles in the system, causing massive corrosive issues once the coolant begins to break down. It breaks down so bad, that it can even begin to conduct electricity through electrolysis and begin eating your system from the inside! Because of this, European and Japanese manufacturers began working on OAT, or Organic Acid Technology Antifreeze.\nOAT antifreeze has a replacement interval of 150,000 miles or generally 5-7 years, and depending on the make, is either silicate free, phosphate free, or both. OAT antifreeze began in the American market with GM\u2019s introduction to Dexcool Orange in 1994. Other manufacturers began tweaking and making OAT coolant better through technology \u2013 providing coolant that was either safer for the environment, had even better anti-corrosion capability, or even had change intervals as long as 10 years.\nThese coolants, either Subaru Blue, Toyota Red, or VW / Audi G12, which is Purple, are the reasons why sticking with the factory-spec\u2019d coolant intended for the vehicle is highly recommended over going with an \u201call makes\u201d coolant \u2013 it is far superior. These colors added by the manufacturer are more-or-less markers to tell you first and foremost, what is in your system currently, and second, an easy identifier to tell you what the right coolant is, and that you are adding the right stuff to the system. For instance, if the reservoir of your VW you see purple, and you\u2019re adding a VW specific purple coolant, it makes it very easy to see that everything is good! All coolant of this variety is either silicate free, phosphate free, or both, and is designed specifically to meet the needs of that particular manufacturers\u2019 testing.\n\nWhat Are \u201cAll Makes\u201d Coolants?\n\nSo what exactly are the \u201call makes\u201d coolants? They are HOAT \u2013 Hybrid Organic Acid Technology. This is an Antifreeze where manufacturers use Nitrates to literally make a \u201ctweener\u201d antifreeze \u2013 that\u2019s something in between IAT and OAT \u2013 meaning, it\u2019s a jack of all trades, and a master of none. It works, and is a great alternative in a pinch, but there are better methods and options for the customer if their vehicle requires a specific antifreeze \u2013 like the Pentosin and Peak manufacturer-specific antifreezes on the market. Mixing traditional IAT (green) antifreeze with an OAT antifreeze can also cause a world of problems. In the late 90\u2019s, Dexcool, GM\u2019s new OAT Antifreeze suffered this wrath and for a while, garnered a horrible reputation because unknowing customers were mixing traditional green IAT antifreeze into their Dexcool systems, eventually creating a brown nasty sludge over time that many consumers faulted Dexcool for. Dexcool was not the problem.\nBesides the type of antifreeze you decide to use, there are some very important points that are worth educating yourself on:\nAll antifreeze breaks down \u2013 whether it\u2019s 36,000 miles with IAT, or 5, 7, 10 years or 150,000 miles \u2013 it must be changed and flushed at some point. If you are unsure whether it\u2019s been flushed, it probably hasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a good idea to change.\nYour heater core is the most neglected item in the flush. Heater cores fail from one thing \u2013 corrosion from within. During the summer months, your heater circuit is shut off from regular circulation in the car\u2019s cooling system, and the bottom of the heater core becomes a sediment pool and the source of corrosion. Your heater core can be flushed directly by simply running your hose-flush through the heater hose and into the heater core. Many customers who do this report nasty, brown sludge coming out of the heater core, or sometimes, complete blockage from debris and sediment. Remember, affording a $50.00 flush isn\u2019t bad. A $1,200.00 heater core job really hurts.\nThe only universal part of coolant is water \u2013 different coolant types should never be mixed. Some studies show that mixing IAT and OAT antifreeze actually caused more corrosion than water alone (remember the GM Dexcool issue above!). If you are unsure what antifreeze is in your system, the antifreeze is brown, an off-color from what is recommended, or what has been put in is an HOAT \u201call makes\u201d antifreeze, the best option is to plan a flush as soon as possible.",

        "title": "How To Find and Fix Coolant Leaks",
        "content": "Understanding Coolant Leaks\n\nCoolant is an essential fluid. That is, if you do not have the right amount of fluid, you are asking for serious trouble that may include substantial engine damage. As such, you should routinely check your car\u2019s coolant levels. If you regularly find that you are adding new fluid to your system, there is a good chance you have a coolant leak.\n\nHow to Detect Coolant Leaks\n\nCOMMON SOURCES OF COOLANT LEAKS\n\n1. A BLOWN HEAD GASKET\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s head gasket seals the space between its\u00a0cylinder head\u00a0and engine block. If the head gasket fails, coolant, and engine oil may mix. You may also notice that coolant is leaking from the bottom of the engine and dripping onto the ground. Either way, a blown head gasket can be disastrous for your engine.\n\n2. A DAMAGED HEATER CORE\n\nYour\u00a0heater core\u00a0is essentially a small radiator that disperses heat into your vehicle\u2019s passenger cabin. While you cannot see the heater core, it may develop a coolant leak. If it does, fluid may accumulate in the plastic housing on the bottom of the heater core.\n\n3. A CRACKED OR DAMAGED HOSE\n\nCoolant may move through many\u00a0different hoses\u00a0under your vehicle\u2019s hood. If one of these hoses develops a crack or hole, coolant may leak.\n\n4. LOOSE OR WORN-OUT HOSE CONNECTIONS\n\nHoses in your vehicle\u2019s cooling system must connect to different components. Some connections may have\u00a0hose clamps, while others may attach on their own. Any place a hose connects, though, is prone to springing a coolant leak.\n\n5. A BROKEN RADIATOR\n\nModern coolant has anti-corrosive agents that help protect your radiator from damage. Still, sometimes radiators develop holes. If your vehicle\u2019s radiator has one, you may notice a leak in front of your engine.\n\nCoolant leaks are serious business any time of the year. That is, even though coolant is commonly called antifreeze, it is essential year-round. Therefore, if you have a car leaking coolant, you must take the leak seriously. Fortunately, finding a coolant leak may not be as difficult as you may think.\n\nFinding Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nOften, finding a coolant leak is simple, as you can see fluid dripping from beneath your vehicle\u2019s hood. You may also notice bubbles in the\u00a0coolant reservoir\u00a0or at a hose connection. You must be careful when checking fluid levels, though. If the engine is not completely cool before you remove the radiator cap, you may suffer a serious burn from escaping steam or hot coolant. Therefore, you should never open the radiator cap or the coolant reservoir when your car\u2019s engine is hot.\nTypically, a coolant leak presents itself in just a few ways. For example, your vehicle\u2019s engine may overheat. If this happens, the\u00a0temperature gauge\u00a0on your instrument panel is likely to move upward, perhaps into the red zone. You may also notice steam coming from under your hood. Or, your vehicle may stall. If your car has a low-coolant indicator light, it may also illuminate.\nTo locate a coolant leak, first look for puddles of coolant beneath your vehicle. If you see any, you probably have fluid dripping from somewhere in the system. With the car\u2019s engine running, look under the hood to see if you notice any fluid flowing out. If you do, trace the fluid to its source. Do not forget to check hose connections and components for leaks. Allowing your vehicle to climb to normal operating temperature and turning on the air conditioner increases pressure in your coolant system. This procedure may allow you to more easily detect a coolant leak.\nIf you cannot see a leak but you are losing coolant, you may need to perform a\u00a0coolant pressure test. A pressure tester is a hand-held tool that allows you to gauge the pressure inside your cooling system. If you have low pressure, you probably have a leak somewhere.\n\nFixing Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nThe best way to fix a coolant leak is to track down the location of the leak and repair the old, damaged, or ineffective part. For example, if you have a cracked hose, replacing it is the most effective way to\u00a0stop your leak. Some components naturally wear out over time. As such, replacing hoses, the\u00a0radiator cap, or the reservoir tank may eventually become necessary on older vehicles.\nYou certainly should keep an eye on hose clamps. With ordinary engine movement, clamps can work their way loose. Checking to see that clamps are always sufficiently tight may prevent a leak from forming in the first place.\nIf your leak is because of something more serious, such as a\u00a0blown head gasket, your fix is not so simple. While replacing a bad head gasket is the best way to go in the longterm, such a replacement is very labor intensive and expensive, and you may be able to use a\u00a0sealant\u00a0for less serious cracks or breaks. Sealant products may also work for holes in the radiator. If you are looking at a costly repair or replacing, trying a sealant first may be the way to go.\n\nFinishing Your\u00a0Project\n\nEven though you may never want to have to deal with a car leaking coolant, the problem is more common than you may think. You cannot ignore coolant leaks or any other issue with your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. Now that you understand how to find and fix coolant leaks, you are ready to tackle your project. To finish it successfully, always choose\u00a0high-quality replacement parts\u00a0and the right coolant for your vehicle. With some planning and a bit of effort, you can stop your vehicle\u2019s coolant leak and extend the life of its engine. \nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How to Check Your Coolant Level",
        "content": "Dangers of\u00a0Low or Contaminated Coolant\n\nThe radiator uses a series of tubes and hoses to transport coolant, or antifreeze, and cool down your engine.\nWithout enough coolant, your engine may overheat.\u00a0Engine cooling system problems\u00a0could arise if you don\u2019t have the right mixture of coolant, which is typically a 50/50 mix of antifreeze and water. Finally, a leak in the system could contaminate your coolant and prevent it from working properly.\nDon\u2019t wait for your engine to overheat, keep an eye out for any signs of a coolant issue. Just like your oil, you should be inspecting your coolant level to prevent any dangerous situation before it occurs. A few minutes of simple inspection and maintenance can prevent a wide range of issues with your engine.\n\nCheck Your Coolant\u00a0Level and Color\n\nNow that you know some of the warning signs to check for, it\u2019s time to inspect your\u00a0radiator\u00a0and coolant reservoir. Make sure your vehicle is on level ground for accurate readings. You\u2019ll also want to wait for it to completely cool down, as your radiator and coolant can become extremely hot.\nOpen your hood and locate your radiator and\u00a0coolant reservoir. Some older vehicles don\u2019t include a reservoir, but most modern vehicles have a small tank for filling and checking the coolant level. The reservoir should be clear plastic, so you can easily see the level of coolant and the maximum fill line.\nBefore you top off your coolant, inspect your current coolant for any unusual coloring or contaminants. Coolant comes in a range of colors, so it\u2019s normal for it to be red, blue, yellow or green. However, if your coolant is colorless, rust-colored, has particles or is oily or sludgy, you\u2019ll want to have it inspected by your local mechanic. These are all signs of contamination that may indicate more severe issues like a\u00a0leak in your head gasket.\nOther warning signs to look out for include cracked radiator hoses and an extremely low coolant level. These need to be repaired, or your new coolant may leak out.\n\nHow to\u00a0Fill Your Coolant\n\nIf your coolant looks great and is just a little low, top it off with premium engine coolant. While IAT formula coolant is the most popular option for most vehicles, be sure to use the same coolant that\u2019s already in your vehicle.\nYour owner\u2019s manual will have more information about the correct type of coolant. Check to see if your brand of coolant needs to be mixed with water or comes pre-mixed. Adding pure coolant with no water can damage your radiator, while too much water mixture can prevent your coolant from working effectively at extreme temperatures.\nSimply top off your coolant to the top of the maximum fill line and close the cap. Make sure that no debris enters your radiator or coolant reservoir. Be sure both the reservoir and radiator caps are secured and start your vehicle.\n\nWhen to\u00a0Drain and Replace Your Coolant\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed any serious signs of damage to your radiator, or any unusual coloring to your coolant, it may be time to drain and replace it. It\u2019s a good idea to have a mechanic to perform these steps, as there could also be an issue with your head gasket or radiator.\nFirst, locate the plug on the bottom of your radiator. Place a\u00a0drain pan\u00a0underneath and completely drain your old coolant. Inspect your drain pan for any signs of particles or contaminants, as these are most likely caused by a cracked radiator or compromised hose. You\u2019ll need to perform additional repairs, or your new coolant will quickly become contaminated as well.\nRefill your coolant, making sure to bleed any air out of the system, replace the plug and top off your coolant reservoir. Start your engine and drive carefully to test whether there\u2019s any air caught in your system. Continue to inspect your coolant reservoir for any signs of a leak.\nNever refill your coolant when your engine is hot. Always wait for it to cool down. If you open a\u00a0radiator cap\u00a0when the engine is still hot, you could be burnt by escaping steam or hot coolant. Even after opening the cap, pouring cold or room-temperature coolant into your hot system could crack a hot engine block.\nCracked, bulging, and leaking hoses need to be replaced before you refill your coolant. When you inspect the radiator, you should take a look at all the hoses. You\u2019ll find them on the top and bottom of your radiator. Because of the extreme temperatures these hoses face, it\u2019s normal for them to begin to wear out and crack over time. After you\u2019ve drained your radiator, replace any damaged hose section for a sealed, secure system.\n\nShop for\u00a0Quality Coolant and Repair Parts\n\nNow that you know how to check antifreeze, it\u2019s time to pick up quality antifreeze.

        "title": "What Is Antifreeze and What Does It Do?",
        "content": "Understanding\u00a0Antifreeze\n\nThe most common types of antifreeze are a combination of water and either ethylene glycol or polyproline glycol. Unless you are a chemist, the chemical makeup of antifreeze may not interest you much. Instead, you need to know the purpose of antifreeze. So, what does antifreeze do?\nIn simple terms, antifreeze circulates through your vehicle\u2019s engine to maintain the temperature of important components. Most importantly, antifreeze keeps the temperature of your vehicle\u2019s engine from dropping to a level that makes it difficult for the engine to do its job. That is, antifreeze prevents the engine from cooling off to a point where it may sustain significant damage. It also stops your car\u2019s engine from overheating. Because an overheated engine can crack, having a steady supply of high-quality antifreeze coursing through the engine is vital for the overall health of your car, truck or SUV.\nAntifreeze comes in a variety of colors, as manufacturers dye their products different shades. There is no distinguishable difference between neon green, pink, or orange coolant. Still, some recipes may use organic compounds that may appeal to you. Regardless of the color of antifreeze you choose, you should realize that coolant can be toxic to humans and pets. Therefore, you should not allow children, dogs or cats to drink spilled antifreeze.\n\nUsing\u00a0Antifreeze\n\nYour car has a\u00a0radiator\u00a0that is likely located in front of its engine. Antifreeze fills the radiator to facilitate cooling. Of course, because the radiator can reach temperatures that can easily burn human skin, the radiator also has an antifreeze or coolant reservoir. When antifreeze levels are low, you can pour coolant into the reservoir without worrying about hot liquid or steam burning you.\nAntifreeze travels through your vehicle\u2019s radiator and engine in a circular fashion, powered by the water pump. Coolant starts in the radiator before moving into the engine. There, it takes on heat that your car\u2019s internal combustion engine naturally creates. After leaving the engine, antifreeze moves past your vehicle\u2019s heating core. The heating core is responsible for keeping your car\u2019s passenger cabin warm when temperatures drop. After picking up heat from the engine and heating the core, antifreeze moves back into the radiator. There, heat disperses before the cycle begins again.\n\nDifferentiating Between\u00a0Water and Antifreeze\n\nAs mentioned, your vehicle\u2019s water pump circulates coolant throughout its\u00a0engine cooling system. While you know that the pump moves antifreeze, you may also wonder if water would work equally as well. The simple answer is no.\nWhen temperatures are moderate, water is probably sufficient to cool your vehicle\u2019s engine. Still, water may corrode sensitive parts of your vehicle. Adding anti-corrosive elements to water does the trick on ordinary days. Nonetheless, when temperatures climb or drop significantly, water does not have the ability to keep your vehicle\u2019s engine at the appropriate temperature. As such, while water may work in a pinch, antifreeze is necessary for the long-term survival of your vehicle\u2019s essential systems.\nWhy does antifreeze do a better job than ordinary water? The chemical formula of antifreeze both lowers its freezing temperature and raises its boiling temperature. As such, when ambient temperatures drop below freezing, antifreeze prevents cold weather from damaging your vehicle\u2019s engine. Further, when your vehicle warms up due to either normal functionality or high outside temperatures, antifreeze keeps internal engine temperatures under control.\n\nReplacing\u00a0Degraded antifreeze\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s engine uses motor oil for lubrication. Still, engine oil does not last forever. In fact, your vehicle\u2019s operator\u2019s manual probably recommends\u00a0changing motor oil\u00a0every few hundred miles, as oil degrades over time. The same is true for antifreeze.\nThe ethylene glycol or polyproline glycol in most antifreeze blends does not degrade over time. Still, antifreeze has anti-corrosion compounds that break down with ordinary usage. These compounds protect the metallic components in your vehicle\u2019s radiator, engine, and other systems from rusting. If you do not occasionally replace antifreeze, sensitive parts of your vehicle may corrode.\nKnowing\u00a0when to replace coolant\u00a0is not difficult. Unlike brake fluid and even engine oil, which may retain its appearance over time, coolant changes color as it breaks down. If your antifreeze takes on a rust-colored or brownish hue, it is likely time to flush it out of your radiator and replace it with a fresh supply.\n\nAdding\u00a0New Antifreeze\n\nIf you need to replace your vehicle\u2019s supply of antifreeze or top off the reservoir, you should first read through your owner\u2019s manual. As usual, following manufacturer recommendation is an effective way to achieve success when replacing or adding antifreeze. You should remember a few things about this fluid, though.\nFirst, you should note that antifreeze usually comes undiluted. With most vehicles, undiluted antifreeze is not compatible. Instead, you must mix the antifreeze with distilled water before adding it to the radiator. A 50-50 mixture of antifreeze and distilled water is typically correct. Still, it is possible to buy premixed antifreeze. If you go this route, you do not want to dilute antifreeze before adding it.\nWhen mixing antifreeze and distilled water, you also must think about where you drive your vehicle. If you keep your car in a place that has temperatures that consistently fall below 34 degrees, you likely want to have a higher percentage of antifreeze than distilled water in your radiator. Generally, a 60-40 or even 70-30 ratio is appropriate.\n\nStaying Ahead of\u00a0Vehicle Maintenance",

        "title": "How the Cooling System Works and How to Maintain It",
        "content": "Take Care of Your Cooling System\n\n8 Cooling System Parts You Should Check Regularly\n\n1. Accessory Belts Drive the Cooling System\n\nWhether your car has V-belts or a serpentine belt, the belt transfers power from the engine\u2019s crankshaft to the water pump to power the cooling system. Inspect belts to make sure they are not loose. Also, look closely for cracking, fraying or excessive rib-wear.\n\n2. The Water Pump Pushes Coolant Through the System\n\nIn order for the system to work, the coolant needs to move throughout the system. The water pump uses power from the crankshaft and serpentine belt to force coolant into the engine and through the rest of the cooling system. Allow your engine to run for a few minutes before inspecting your water pump. Visually check for leaks around the unit. Failure of your passenger compartment to heat properly can also indicate a faulty water pump.\n\n3. The Heater Core Helps Adjust Cabin Air Temperatures\n\nThe heater core is where the engine cooling system meets the cabin AC system. The core is where heat from the engine warms up cabin air, which also helps the coolant lose some heat before returning to the radiator to be cooled again. Inspect for signs of leakage indicated by fluid around the heater core or wet spots on your carpet. Constant presence of fog on the inside of your windshield can also mean that your heater core needs replacing.\n\n4. Heater and Radiator Hoses Carry Coolant Through the System\n\nCoolant hoses direct coolant between the other parts of this system. Make sure all hose connections are secure. Inspect for swelling, cracking and fraying. Also, make sure there are no collapsed or soft sections. Always check hoses while engine is cool.\n\n5. Cooling Fans Move Air Past the Radiator to Prevent Overheating\n\nRadiator fans increase airflow to help the system cool more efficiently. Make sure all blades on your cooling fan are in good condition and not damaged. A noisy fan blade is a good indicator of damage.\n\n6. Coolant Temperatures are Measured by the Thermostat Before Returning to the Radiator\n\nThe thermostat measures the temperature of coolant before it comes back to the radiator. This lets your car\u2019s engine computer keep track on how well the vehicle is cooling the engine, and ensure that the cooling system is operating correctly.\n\n7. The Radiator Exchanges Coolant Heat with Outside Air\n\nAs coolant flows through the radiator, cool air blows past the radiator, cooling the coolant before it is recirculated through the engine. Check your radiator fluid for the proper concentration in the coolant reservoir. Consult your owner\u2019s manual for the location of your reservoir. Most manufacturers recommend 50% antifreeze and 50% water mixture. Make sure the fluid reaches the \u201cFull\u201d line. If not, pour in enough antifreeze to reach the line. An AutoZone store associate can help you find the right antifreeze for your vehicle.\n\n8. The Radiator Cap Allows for Easy Filling\n\nThe radiator often acts as a reservoir for coolant, and this cap seals the system while providing easy access for when more coolant needs to be added. Make sure your radiator cap is always tight and secure so that it seals properly. Never remove it when the engine is hot. Here are some guidelines on when you should replace your radiator cap:\n\nRadiator caps can deteriorate after 40,000-50,000 miles\nAs a general rule, radiator caps should be changed when a thermostat, water pump or radiator is replaced. This will ensure the system is operating at the proper pressure\n\nFlushing and Filling is Easy as 1-2-3!\n\nRemember to flush and fill your radiator every 24 months or 24,000 miles.\n\nDrain your cooling system\nFlush with water and a quality flush product\nFill with 50%-50% or 70%-30% antifreeze water mixture. Use more antifreeze if you drive in extreme temperatures\n\nStop by your local AutoZone store for more helpful advice and everything you need to do the job right. Find an auto parts store near you.",

        "title": "What's Causing My Coolant Reservoir to Overflow?",
        "content": "WHAT\u2019S CAUSING MY COOLANT RESERVOIR TO OVERFLOW?\n\n1. COOLANT\u00a0LEVEL\n\nBe sure you have the proper level of coolant in your vehicle. Overfilling may cause overflowing.\n\n2. RADIATOR CAP\n\nCheap and easy to replace, this is the first thing to check. Your problem may simply be a loose or damaged cap not keeping coolant where it needs to be. The radiator cap is designed to allow access to fluids in a \u2018closed\u2019 system. The coolant used to cool the engine does so at maximum efficiency when kept at specific pressure. Check your owner\u2019s manual for proper cap replacement. The radiator cap comes in different pressures.\n\n3. THERMOSTAT\n\nMost of the rest of these problems will cause a check engine light to turn on, but they could have an issue and not be noticed by your vehicle\u2019s computer. A bad thermostat can improperly regulate fluid, and can lead to overflow.\n\n4. WATER PUMP\n\nHow to tell if your over heating problem is caused by the water pump. Faulty water pumps slow or stop the flow of fluid through the cooling system. The result is overheating of the engine. You will see coolant fluid on the ground and around the water pump when the water pump has gone bad. Water pumps either work properly or go bad in a hurry. There is no \u201ckeeping an eye on it\u201d for validation.\n\n5. RADIATOR\n\nIf the cap, thermostat and water pump are all fine, the reservoir is overflowing most likely because of a radiator problem. In older automobiles, the radiator was made of copper and aluminum. In more modern automobiles, the radiator contains a lot of plastic. The plastic radiator are light weight, but tend to ware out faster. Replacing the radiator is recommended over applying a patch if the leak is found.\n\n6. CRACKED HEAD OR BLOCK, OR HEAD GASKET LEAK\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing gas bubbles or some boiling in the liquid when you remove the radiator cap, a cracked head or block may be to blame. Do not remove a radiator cap from a hot engine to check. You can experience a shot of boiling water exploding under pressure. Your local repair shop can perform test to identify cylinder head or engine block cracks.",

        "title": "How to Flush a Radiator",
        "content": "Choosing the Right Coolant\n\nPrioritize Safety\n\nYour first priority when learning how to flush a coolant system, or completing any vehicle maintenance project, is your personal safety. Start by parking your car on a surface that is both dry and flat. You can then use\u202fwheel chocks\u202fso that your vehicle will not move while you\u2019re working.\nWait for at least an hour after you turn off your engine before attempting to flush your radiator. Place your hand near the car radiator to get an idea of the car\u2019s heat level. If you feel no heat, place your hand near the radiator cap. Again, if you feel no heat you can proceed with the job. Finally, safety gloves and goggles should be worn while doing this job.\n\nTools and Equipment\n\nFlushing your car\u2019s coolant system is more than just emptying the radiator and refilling, as the car\u2019s engine block, heater core, and other items all contain antifreeze. DIY flush kits are available at AutoZone that hook into your heater hoses and flush garden hose water through the entire system, and through your heater core. \nIt is highly recommended that when doing a flush, you are flushing the entire system out with water in this fashion. Once you\u2019ve determined whether you are going to do a complete flush or just a radiator drain/full, proceed by opening your hood and secure it so that you can inspect your radiator along with all the attached hoses. Keep an eye out for any leaks, cracks, or stressed-looking rubber. A worn and damaged hose may need to be replaced. At this time, install your flush kit into the heater hose if you plan on flushing the system.\n\nHow to Flush Your Radiator / Cooling System\n\n1. Safety First\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and install\u202fwheel chocks. Make sure the vehicle has not been running for at least an hour and that the engine and radiator are cool. Be sure to wear\u202fsafety goggles\u202fand\u202fprotective gloves. Keep coolant away from pets or small children. Clean up any spills immediately. Do not pour coolant down a drain or toilet.\n\n2. Setting Up The Job\n\nOpen and secure the hood. Inspect the\u202fradiator and hoses for any cracks or signs of leaks. Once you\u2019ve determined whether you are going to do a complete flush or just a radiator drain/full, proceed by opening your hood and secure it so that you can inspect your radiator along with all the attached hoses.\nKeep an eye out for any leaks, cracks, or stressed-looking rubber. A worn and damaged hose may need to be replaced. At this time, install your flush kit into the heater hose if you plan on flushing the system. If you notice a worn or damaged hose, it may need to be replaced.\n\n3. Press Down and Remove the Radiator Cap\n\nCarefully press down on the radiator cap and remove it. Make sure the vehicle has not been running for at least an hour and that the engine and radiator are cool. Opening the cap on a hot radiator is extremely dangerous.\n\n4. Locate the Drain Plug and Loosen\n\nLocate the drain plug. This is found on the bottom of the radiator. Place a pan under the drain plug to catch old coolant. Loosen the drain plug and allow coolant to flow. Tighten the drain\u202fplug when coolant has stopped flowing.\n\n5. Fill the Cooling System with Distilled Water\n\nCheck instructions on flush bottle for specific steps. Steps vary according to flush product. Fill the system with both water and flush product. Using a flush product is good to break up any sediment or corrosion and get it out of the system.\n\n6. Install the Radiator Cap and Run the Engine\n\nInstall the radiator cap and run the engine for 10 minutes with the heater on maximum. Only run the engine outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Turn off engine and allow radiator to cool. Repeat drain procedure.\n\n7. Loosen Lower Radiator Hose\n\nOnce you\u2019ve ran flush through and drained the radiator again, it\u2019s a good idea to get any sediment out of the bottom of the radiator that the drain cannot remove. Once the hose is loose and can be removed. Fill the radiator up with garden hose or bottled water, then pull the hose and drain any sediment / dirty water out. At this point, very little of the water will contain antifreeze, but a good deal of sediment that has settled in the bottom of the radiator will come out. Next, hook up your hose to your flush valve you installed and follow the flushing instructions.\n\n8. Drain Out Final Dirty Water\n\nOnce the system has been completely flushed, you will need to drain the system of the remaining dirty flush water in both the radiator, and as much out of the block as you can. Remember, all of this water contains antifreeze, so make sure you follow local ordinances on capturing antifreeze.\n\n9. Fill with New Antifreeze\n\nFill the system with new antifreeze. If using concentrated antifreeze, be sure to use distilled water. Located any bleeder screws in the system that need to be opened to remove excess air. It is vitally important that these are located, or an air bubble can cause the car to overheat.\n\nThe Cleanup\n\nClean the area around your pan and make sure no spilled fluids are on the ground. Next, you need to dispose of the old coolant and other fluids in your pan. There are many laws governing the disposal of these fluids and they vary in different jurisdictions, so make sure you are following the regulations where you live. Whatever you do, never pour these fluids down your toilet or into a drain. Finally, give yourself a hand. You now know how to flush your radiator and cooling system!\n\nGet the Help You Need\n\nBoth draining and replacing the coolant in your engine are repair jobs that will present a moderate level of difficulty.

        "title": "Why Does My Engine Sound Loud When Accelerating",
        "content": "Understanding Engine Noise during Acceleration\n\nWhen you push the pedal and your engine responds with a rising note, it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s creating the sound you hear. Acceleration requires your engine to burn more fuel and air, generating higher energy levels. When you demand this power increase, the internal components of your engine can produce various sounds, often becoming more pronounced. Additionally, factors like the type of engine such as inline, V-shaped, boxer, and so on, the number of cylinders, and the design of the exhaust system can influence the nature of these sounds.\nEngine noises can vary dramatically. Some might be high-pitched whining, while others can be low rumbles. A motorcycle-like sound often means your engine is working hard and that the exhaust system might not be properly sealed. Common types of engine noise you might encounter during acceleration include:\n\nKnocking or pinging \u2013 This is a high-frequency rattling noise that often signals the fuel in your engine isn\u2019t burning evenly or at the right time, potentially damaging critical components.\nRoaring \u2013 These can be symptomatic of exhaust issues, like leaks or problems with the resonator, a part of the muffler designed to reduce noise.\nTapping, clicking, or ticking \u2013 This noise, which tends to be more rhythmic, can result from lack of oil, issues with the valvetrain, or even problems in the engine\u2019s rotating parts.\n\nCommon Causes of Loud Engine Sounds\n\nThere are several common culprits when it comes to a noisy engine during acceleration. And within each category, there can be multiple causes.\n\nExhaust System Issues\n\nThe exhaust system manages gases from the combustion cycle and muffles the noise your engine makes. When this system is compromised, you get loud engine sounds. It could be from:\n\nExhaust leaks \u2013 A hole in the exhaust system such as a muffler or exhaust pipe or a leak in places like the exhaust manifold can cause a significant increase in noise.\nCatalytic Converter Failure \u2013\u00a0 One of the components for treating exhaust gases, a failing catalytic converter can lead to a louder engine.\n\nEngine Misfires\n\nThese are instances when the air-fuel mixture fails to burn as it should, creating imbalances and vibrations:\n\nFuel injection system issues \u2013 A fuel injector that\u2019s clogged or malfunctioning can lead to too little or too much fuel being delivered to the cylinder, causing misfires.\nIgnition problems \u2013 A weak spark, malfunctioning spark plug, or ignition coil can result in the fuel not being ignited properly.\n\nWorn or Faulty Components\n\nOver time, the wear and tear on engine components can lead to increased noise levels:\n\nPiston slap \u2013 This occurs when the piston rocks back and forth in the cylinder, causing a metallic sound as it contacts the cylinder wall.\nWorn bearings \u2013 Bearings support the rotating shafts in your engine and can produce a knocking noise when they\u2019re worn out.\n\nImpact of Acceleration on Engine Performance\n\nUnderstanding the effects of acceleration on your engine\u2019s health is essential to long-term vehicle maintenance. Sudden acceleration can place a considerable strain on several internal components. The faster your engine operates, the more valves, pistons, and other moving metal parts move, which can lead to increased wear. Turbochargers can further exacerbate the issue, as the turbo spools up to provide more power, increasing pressure and heat.\nAggressive driving can severely hamper your fuel economy. The faster you accelerate, the more fuel your engine will consume. But there are ways to balance power and efficiency, even during acceleration. Gradually increasing your speed puts less strain on your engine and can save fuel, and keeping your engine in good shape can ensure that no harm is done, even during acceleration.\n\nDiagnosing and Resolving Engine Noise\n\nNow that you understand the factors at play, it\u2019s time to get to the bottom of the issue, starting with some do-it-yourself methods.\nIf your engine is causing noise, these simple checks can often reveal the source:\n\nPerform a visual inspection of your exhaust system, looking for holes, rust, or other indicators of damage.\nEnsure that your spark plugs are clean and not worn, and that the ignition cables and connections are secure.\nA stethoscope can be a handy tool to isolate the source of the noise, whether it\u2019s a pulley, water pump, or another accessory.\n\nIf the issue isn\u2019t readily apparent or you\u2019re uncomfortable diagnosing the problem yourself, don\u2019t hesitate to seek help from a professional. A qualified mechanic can provide a more thorough inspection, using diagnostic tools and methods that might be beyond your scope.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What is a Muffler and How Does it Work?",
        "content": "The Role of Mufflers in a Vehicle\n\nA muffler, also referred to as a silencer, reduces the noise generated by the engine during the exhaust process. Without a muffler, your vehicle would roar with a deafening cacophony, making for an unpleasant and noisy driving experience.\nBut the role of mufflers extends beyond just noise reduction. They also play a crucial part in enhancing engine performance and improving fuel efficiency. Mufflers help regulate exhaust flow which can impact the engine\u2019s power output and overall efficiency. Additionally, they help safely remove harmful gases from the engine, ensuring that the vehicle complies with emission standards.\n\nInner Workings: How Mufflers Reduce Noise\n\nTo understand how mufflers reduce noise, it\u2019s essential to grasp how they\u2019re designed inside. Mufflers are typically constructed with a series of chambers and tubes, often filled with sound-absorbing materials like fiberglass batting. When exhaust gases exit the engine, they do so at high pressure and velocity, producing a loud, popping noise.\nMufflers work by allowing these high-pressure exhaust gases to expand and slow down. This process reduces the velocity and pressure of the gases before they exit the tailpipe. The sound-absorbing materials inside the muffler further dampen or \u201cmuffle\u201d the noise, which is where its name comes from.\nDifferent mufflers use various design elements to reduce noise including perforated tubes, baffles, and resonators. These components work in harmony to minimize noise while allowing exhaust gases to flow smoothly. At the most basic level, sound waves bounce around inside, collide, and cancel each other out to reduce the volume level.\n\nMufflers and Emissions. Environmental Impact\n\nBeyond noise reduction, mufflers also have a significant impact on the environment. Modern vehicles are equipped with catalytic converters that reduce harmful emissions, but mufflers play a supporting role in this process. They help ensure that exhaust gases are evenly distributed and flow through the catalytic converter efficiently.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad EGR Valve",
        "content": "Purpose of an EGR Valve\n\nThe air you breathe is made up of approximately 78 percent nitrogen, and that\u2019s the same air that your engine consumes for combustion. The nitrogen doesn\u2019t burn in the process, but the extreme heat that it experiences makes it much more reactive than it normally is. It forms nitrogen oxides, or NOx gases, and they\u2019re responsible in part for greenhouse gases and environmental pollution, and they\u2019re harmful to breathe.\nAn EGR valve performs a unique job that most people aren\u2019t aware of. It meters a portion of exhaust gases back into the engine\u2019s intake. The purpose is to make the air less combustible so it doesn\u2019t burn as fast and as hot in the combustion chamber. Essentially, it dilutes the oxygen in the air-fuel ratio, reducing the temperature and, thus, reducing the formation of NOx gases. As a bonus, it helps to improve fuel efficiency and promotes healthier running conditions.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad EGR Valve\n\nOver several years and many miles of driving, your EGR valve could start to act up. When it does, it could be stuck open or closed, or it could operate sporadically. Because it\u2019s so intrinsic to your engine\u2019s operation, you\u2019ll notice symptoms of a bad EGR valve such as:\n\nPoor engine performance. A malfunctioning EGR valve can lead to a noticeable decline in engine performance. You may experience a rough idle, hesitation, or stalling when starting your vehicle. Acceleration may feel sluggish, or you may notice a lack of power when driving uphill.\nIncreased fuel consumption. If the EGR valve is stuck open, it will allow exhaust gases to enter the combustion chamber at improper times. This can result in incomplete combustion, leading to reduced fuel efficiency.\nCheck Engine Light. A bad EGR valve can trigger the check engine light on your dashboard due to the engine control module detecting an issue with the EGR system.\nPinging or knocking sounds. When the EGR valve fails to open, the combustion temperature within the engine increases. This can cause pinging or knocking sounds, particularly during acceleration or when driving under load.\nFailed emissions test. AnEGR valve helps reduce harmful NOx emissions, and a bad EGR valve can\u2019t effectively control NOx levels.\nRough or uneven idle. A stuck-open EGR valve allows exhaust gases to enter the intake manifold when the engine is not under load. This can lead to poor combustion and cause the engine to idle roughly or even stall.\n\nCauses of a Bad EGR Valve\n\nBad Fuel\n\nLow-quality or contaminated fuel can contribute to the deterioration of the EGR valve. Impurities in the fuel can cause deposits to build up within the valve, hindering its ability to open and close correctly. This can lead to reduced engine performance, increased emissions, and potential damage to the EGR valve itself.\n\nLack of Maintenance\n\nNeglecting regular maintenance of your vehicle can contribute to EGR valve failure. Over time, carbon deposits can accumulate within the valve and its associated components, restricting the flow of exhaust gases and negatively impacting the valve\u2019s functionality.\n\nFaulty Parts\n\nA bad EGR valve may also be caused by issues with the surrounding components, such as the EGR solenoid, vacuum hoses, or electrical connections. A bad EGR solenoid can prevent the valve from opening or closing properly, while damaged vacuum hoses or electrical connections can disrupt the communication between the valve and the ECM.\n\nManufacturing Defects\n\nThough rare, manufacturing defects can also cause EGR valve issues. In such cases, the valve may be faulty from the start, leading to poor performance or premature failure.\n\nExtreme Operating Conditions\n\nExposure to extreme operating conditions, such as high temperatures, excessive dust, or prolonged periods of heavy load, can hasten the wear and tear on an EGR valve. These conditions can lead to accelerated carbon buildup and increased stress on the valve components, potentially causing premature failure.\n\nPreventive Maintenance\n\nTo minimize the risk of bad fuel causing issues with your EGR valve, ensure you use reputable fuel sources and follow your vehicle manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for fuel type. Routine maintenance, such as regular oil changes and cleaning or replacing the EGR valve as per the maintenance schedule, can help prevent issues and extend the life of the valve.",

        "title": "What Is an EGR Valve?",
        "content": "What is an EGR Valve?\n\nThe primary function of the EGR valve in a car is to help reduce harmful NOx emissions, which result in air pollution and can contribute to various respiratory illnesses. By recirculating some of the exhaust gases back into the engine, the EGR valve can lower the amount of oxygen that reaches the combustion chamber. This reduction in oxygen levels leads to a decrease in combustion temperatures, which, in turn, reduces NOx formation, and it can actually boost fuel efficiency as a side benefit.\n\nHow an EGR Valve Works\n\nThe valve is typically mounted on the engine\u2019s intake manifold and is either electrically or vacuum operated, depending on the specific vehicle model. When the valve is activated, a portion of the exhaust gases is drawn back into the engine\u2019s intake manifold, where it mixes with the air-fuel mixture before it\u2019s delivered into the combustion chamber to be burned.\nThe recirculation of exhaust gases into the engine\u2019s intake manifold lowers the amount of oxygen available for combustion. The burn rate is slowed down once it ignites, ultimately reducing the temperature inside the engine\u2019s combustion chamber. This lower temperature leads to a decrease in NOx formation, since high temperatures are one of the primary contributors to why NOx emissions develop.\nMoreover, the EGR valve\u2019s design is aimed at enhancing the engine\u2019s fuel efficiency. By reducing the amount of oxygen available for combustion, the engine does less work, leading to more mileage per gallon.\n\nPreventing EGR Valve Issues\n\nEGR valves are meant to be extremely durable, but they can encounter issues that require a replacement. Common problems can include:\n\nCarbon buildup in the EBG valve passages. It\u2019s due to high-temperature exhaust gases mixing with oil vapor that can gum up the valve, leading to misfires, stalling, and performance issues.\nA bad solenoid or vacuum modulator valve. If this happens, the valve may not open and close properly, appearing like a leak to the onboard computers. It\u2019s highly likely to trigger a Check Engine Light.\nA faulty temperature sensor. Since the EGR valve opens when the engine is at operating temperature, a bad reading can prevent the EGR valve from opening and closing as it should.\n\nFortunately, most exhaust gas recirculation valve problems can be prevented before they start. One of the key methods is by performing your routine maintenance on time, all the time. Dirty engine oil can cause higher rates of buildup in the EGR valve as the exhaust gases carry the fumes through it.\n\nOther ways to keep the EGR from failing include:\n\nUsing an engine additive occasionally to help break down any buildup that has formed.\nAccessing and cleaning the EGR valve with intake valve cleaner to break down carbon formation at the first sign of symptoms.\nIf you drive a diesel-powered vehicle, use an EGR/DPF fuel additive occasionally.\nDrive your vehicle on the highway at full operating temperature. A weekly drive of 30 minutes or more should do the trick.",

        "title": "How to Replace a PCV Valve",
        "content": "When to Replace a PCV Valve\n\nRegular replacement intervals are often dictated in your maintenance guide or service manual, and those should be followed carefully for all components, including the PCV valve replacement. The interval ranges greatly between makes and models, with many being as low as 20,000 miles and others as high as 50,000 miles. Others yet will simply say to check the valve to confirm operation and replace it as necessary.\nAside from changing it according to mileage, the PCV valve should be replaced if symptoms are present. They can include:\n\nHigher than normal fuel consumption.\nA Check Engine Light with misfire codes.\nStumbling, low idle speed, or stalling at idle.\nOil consumption or oily smoke from the tailpipe.\nMajor oil leaks from the engine.\nMilky, moisture-contaminated engine oil.\n\nAll of these symptoms can be caused by other factors too, so it\u2019s important to check the PCV valve to ensure it\u2019s working. In many instances, you can remove the valve and shake it \u2013 if it rattles, that usually means it\u2019s in good shape. Or, you can blow through it both ways. Since it\u2019s a one-way valve, air should only pass through it in one direction.\n\nHow To Replace a PCV Valve\n\nWhether you\u2019re checking or changing the PCV valve, removing it is the same process. Follow these steps to take it out. Since it\u2019s a small cost, if you suspect the PCV valve as being bad, it\u2019s a good plan to install a new one.\n\n1. Locate the PCV valve \n\nCheck a service manual or online resource if you\u2019re unable to locate it. Typically, it\u2019s a small cylindrical canister that\u2019s fastened onto or pushed into a valve cover and has a hose attached to it.\n\n2. Remove the valve\n\nUsing a pair of pliers, gently wiggle the hose off of the end of the valve. Then, remove the valve with pliers, a wrench, or a socket, depending on how yours is mounted.\u00a0\n\n3. Check the valve\u2019s condition\n\nEven if you\u2019re replacing it, inspect that the valve is working so you know whether the valve is your problem or if there\u2019s something else causing your symptoms. Shake it or blow air through it to verify its operation.\n\n4. Install the new valve\n\nYour new PCV valve is installed in exactly the reverse order as the removal. Make sure any hose barbs are positioned the same way as the old one, then tighten any fasteners to secure the part.\n\n5. Verify the repair\n\nAfter installing your new PCV valve, clear any DTCs and check that your previous symptoms have been remedied. If not, there\u2019s likely a different cause you need to track down.\n\nPCV Valve Maintenance\n\nIf you have a unique PCV valve or you\u2019d like to save money on the job, it\u2019s often possible to clean the PCV valve rather than replace it. Once it\u2019s removed, place it in carb cleaner, solvent, or brake cleaner to dissolve any sticky, oily, or sludgy residue inside.\nYou can help prevent PCV valve issues by following routine maintenance. Clean engine oil is important to avert symptoms that require a replacement PCV valve, and extended oil change intervals can put your car at risk unnecessarily.",

        "title": "What Is a PCV Valve?",
        "content": "What Is a PCV Valve?\n\nSo, what is a PCV valve exactly? It\u2019s a small, spring-loaded valve that\u2019s usually located on the top of the engine valve cover. It\u2019s responsible for routing crankcase fumes back into the engine\u2019s intake manifold where they\u2019re burned off.\nThis process helps to maintain the engine\u2019s health and performance and prevent problems related to too much pressure inside the crankcase. This prevents oil leaks that can cause clogs or corrosion in your engine as well as reduce its efficiency and performance.\n\nWhat Does a PCV Valve Do?\u00a0\n\nWhen the engine is running, pressure is created in the crankcase and, without letting that pressure out, it can lead to oil leaks from oil seals blown out, as well as other issues. The PCV valve helps to regulate this pressure by controlling the flow of air into and out of the crankcase. It uses engine vacuum to pull crankcase fumes through the valve and into the intake manifold, where they\u2019re burned during combustion.\n\nWhen to Replace a PCV Valve\n\nFor some vehicles, the PCV valve is considered a maintenance item that should be changed at regular intervals according to the service schedule. For others, the valve is integrated into the valve cover, for example, and only gets changed when there\u2019s a problem. If yours is easily accessible, it\u2019s likely the interval to change it is between 20,000 and 50,000 miles.\nBut other indications that you need to change the PCV valve include symptoms like:\n\nIncreased oil consumption. This can mean your PCV valve is stuck closed and oil is getting pushed past the piston rings and burned in the cylinders.\nFouled spark plugs or a misfire. Also due to oil entering the combustion chamber, the spark plugs can\u2019t fire properly when they\u2019re coated in oil.\nPoor fuel economy. Since the engine isn\u2019t running efficiently, it compensates by adjusting the air-fuel mixture.\nRunning issues. Your car could run very rough at idle or have low RPM.\nOil leaks. High crankcase pressure can force an oil seal to unseat or tear, creating a potentially major oil leak.",

        "title": "The Difference Between Muffler and Exhaust",
        "content": "Introducing the Muffler and Exhaust System\n\nA muffler is a part of a vehicle\u2019s exhaust system that muffles, or reduces, engine noise through soundproofing techniques. Exhaust systems are parts of an engine\u2019s ventilation that transfer exhaust gases from within an engine\u2019s cylinder to the outside atmosphere.\nThe muffler\u2019s primary purpose is to muffle or reduce sounds coming from the engine, while the exhaust pipe\u2018s primary purpose is to eject exhaust gases away from the car\u00b4s occupant compartment. Both mufflers and the exhaust system as a whole are important in keeping your vehicle safe on the road as they improve emissions performance, reduce noise, reduce backpressure against the pistons, provide durability and reliability, and ensure good fuel economy and performance.\n\nLocation of the Muffler and Exhaust System\n\nKnowing the location of your muffler and exhaust system is important in understanding how they function for your car.\nA muffler is located within the exhaust system, usually right behind the rear axle and before the tailpipe. It\u2019s typically made of stainless steel or aluminum and looks like a barrel-shaped canister that reduces sound created by exhaust gases while they pass through.\nThe rest of the exhaust system includes the catalytic converter which reduces emissions, resonators and pipes to route gases from the engine to the muffler, as well as a tailpipe which vents gases out to the atmosphere. All these parts come together to make up an efficient, powerful, and sometimes visually appealing exhaust system.\n\nFunction of the Muffler and Exhaust System\n\nA muffler and the greater exhaust system work to increase power efficiency, reduce emissions, and keep your vehicle running smoothly.\nThe muffler\u2019s primary function is reducing noise inside the cabin as well as outside on the streets. Baffles inside deflect sound waves that collide, essentially canceling each other out. It can contain materials like fiberglass batting to help disrupt and nullify sounds too.\nThe exhaust system helps move toxic gases away from the engine and out of your car while doing so with improved performance. It routes exhaust gases through a tubing system as they travel along its path. As these high-temperature gases blast through various components, such as catalytic converters and resonators, they are deflected in order to create a controlled airflow resistance called backpressure that helps reduce levels of noise pollution emitted by your car and help the engine run efficiently.\nBy maintaining the muffler and exhaust system, all of these benefits will be maximized, allowing for a better driving experience all-round.\n\nThe Importance of Maintaining the Muffler and Exhaust System\n\nProper maintenance of your vehicle\u2019s muffler and exhaust system can save you time, money, and frustration. Mufflers should be regularly inspected for rusted parts or detached hangers and the exhaust pipe should be checked for corrosion or leaking. A common symptom is a crack or jagged rust hole with flaky edges on the muffler\u2019s body.\nExhaust clamps should be replaced if they\u2019re broken or loose to ensure a tight seal that prevents leaks.\nExhaust gases have corrosive properties so it is critical to check your muffler and exhaust system once a year to keep them at their best. This ensures your car keeps performing as it should while you drive, and it helps to minimize any potential issues ranging from bad catalytic converters or other permanently damaged components.\n\nSigns of Problems with Your Muffler or Exhaust System\n\nWhile a car\u2019s muffler and exhaust system symptoms are often confused with one another, there are ways to tell them apart.\nCommon symptoms of a bad muffler may include:\n\nAn overly noisy exhaust that sounds too loud, especially under acceleration\nA rattling noise coming from the rear of the car\nPoor engine performance when accelerating\nVisible holes in the muffler\n\nIf it\u2019s a component in your exhaust system instead of the muffler, you might notice:\n\nA Check Engine Light on due to catalytic converter codes\nIncreased fuel consumption\nRough idle or shaking on acceleration\nRaw fuel smells under your car, or even entering the cabin\nPopping or knocking noises from under your car that vary with RPMs\n\nKnowing the difference between a muffler and exhaust, as well as their location and function, important for any driver. Being aware of general maintenance tips and symptoms of an issue can help you protect your vehicle from larger repair bills in the future. All of this information is necessary for maintaining a safe, efficient, and comfortable experience in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\u00a0Although cars may not always feel like the first priority, it is important to remember that it serves as the way to get between places that matter most. Taking the time out of your day to properly maintain your vehicle \u2013 including the exhaust system will pay dividends in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Common Signs of a Bad Muffler\n\nWith some vehicle problems, you might not notice symptoms immediately. A bad muffler is not one of them. Once there\u2019s damage, it becomes evident quickly. Common symptoms of a bad muffler include:\n\nExcessive noise coming from the exhaust. A hole in the muffler is the main cause here, and the exhaust gases escape the muffler without being dampened.\nRattling or vibrations. Baffles can come loose or rust away inside, and the material that\u2019s used for insulation can come out. It acts like a pebble in a tin can, rattling or vibrating enough to annoy you quickly.\nFumes from the exhaust. While the muffler doesn\u2019t treat or minimize fumes, you might detect an abnormal exhaust odor inside the car if they escape under your car and get into the cabin.\nDecreased fuel efficiency. \u00a0A restriction in the muffler or exhaust system can force the engine to work harder to push past it, and it can consequently burn more fuel.\nBackfiring or other engine issues can also occur from too much or too little back pressure.\n\nIf you notice any of these symptoms, it is important to have your muffler inspected and replaced if necessary.\n\nCauses of Muffler Problems\n\nThe main causes of muffler problems include corrosion, exhaust leaks, improper installation, and regular wear and tear.\nCorrosion is caused by exposure to water or other corrosive elements that can cause the muffler to rust and eventually fail. While external corrosion is possible, it\u2019s mostly caused by water trapped in the muffler due to a plugged drain hole.\nExhaust leaks can be caused by a crack in the muffler due to vibration or from an impact with road debris. An impact can also collapse the structure of the muffler, creating a restriction.\nImproper installation can also lead to reduced performance or failure of the muffler. That includes poor welds or clamps, or if the muffler is contacting the chassis or other parts that can wear through the metal.\nFinally, regular wear and tear over time can lead to the deterioration of the muffler\u2019s internal components.\n\nThe Importance of Regular Muffler Maintenance\n\nTucked under the back of your car, the muffler is often forgotten about unless there\u2019s a problem. A little bit of maintenance can help prevent it from corroding prematurely, and it involves ensuring the drain holes in the muffler body aren\u2019t blocked. A toothpick or short section of wire can help push crud out of the way so water can drip out, but you don\u2019t want to be doing that often.\nOtherwise, muffler maintenance involves keeping the undercarriage clean. When you wash your car, thoroughly rinse any dirt off of the muffler. As it collects, dirt retains water against the muffler body and, even though it\u2019s meant to be corrosion-resistant, it can eventually rust through.\nYou might be able to prolong your muffler with these tips, but you\u2019ll likely have a rotten or damaged muffler eventually. Replacing a broken muffler is often the best option, as this involves unbolting or cutting off the old one and fitting a new part that matches its specifications. For more customized solutions, you can look into aftermarket performance mufflers, however, you should always check with your local regulations first to make sure such an upgrade complies.\nIf damage isn\u2019t too extensive on both the muffler and chamber area, repairs may be possible with welding or patching techniques, although it usually carries short-term results.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Does Muffler Replacement Cost?",
        "content": "Factors Affecting the Cost of Muffler Replacement\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the market for a muffler replacement, there are a variety of factors that can affect the cost such as:\n\nThe make and model of your vehicle. Some luxury, high-performance, or exotic models have a higher price point for parts in most cases, as is the case with less popular models.\nAny additional parts that may be required during its installation. If you need a section of exhaust pipe, a catalytic converter, a tailpipe, or exhaust hangers, the price of parts will be significantly higher.\nThe cost of labor to install it. Unless you install the muffler yourself, you\u2019ll need to pay a mechanic to remove the old one and install the new part.\nThe availability of parts. If you\u2019re in a tight time constraint, there might be fewer options available on short notice.\n\nAlso, more high-performance exhaust systems tend to require more labor for fitment and the parts are often more expensive than their direct replacement counterparts. It\u2019s important to take these elements into consideration when budgeting for a muffler replacement project.\n\nAverage Cost of Muffler Replacement\n\nAutomotive maintenance and repairs can be expensive, but replacing a muffler does not have to break the bank. So, how much to replace a muffler? The amount you pay for a new muffler will vary widely depending on the type of vehicle you drive, labor costs at the shop where you have it installed, and other factors such as shop supplies and incidental parts.\nGenerally, an aftermarket muffler may cost between $50 and $400, although there are plenty of instances where the muffler can be much higher in price. Original equipment (OE) replacement mufflers may cost significantly more \u2013 up to $1,000 or more. You\u2019ll also need exhaust bands or clamps to fasten it in place, and you may need gaskets, a tailpipe, and exhaust hangers or straps to finish the installation.\nIf you\u2019re installing the muffler yourself, there are no labor costs. But if you don\u2019t know how to install it or have the equipment and tools necessary, you\u2019ll need to hire a mechanic to do it. That can range from around $50 to $200, perhaps more, depending on how complex the job is on your particular vehicle.\n\nTips for Finding the Best Deal\n\nAlso, if possible, consider buying the parts yourself and having a local mechanic install them. You may be able to save considerably in labor costs this way rather than paying for marked-up parts at your mechanic.\nFinally, take the time to talk to multiple mechanics or shops and get estimates before making your final decision. While there are general guidelines for muffler replacement times, each shop can and does set its own labor rate and fees for working on your car.\nWith that extra effort and comparison shopping, you can be sure to find the best deal and get your car sounding safe again.\n\nWhat to Expect When Replacing a Muffler\n\nIf you\u2019re a DIYer, muffler replacement isn\u2019t the most complicated job you\u2019ll ever encounter. Still, there are parts of the process you might not be prepared for if it\u2019s your first time working on the exhaust system.\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to make space for yourself under the car. Secure the car up on blocks before you crawl underneath. And of course, let the car cool down before attempting to handle a hot exhaust.\nAlso, to protect yourself, wear gloves and safety glasses. Metal burrs and sharp edges can leave cuts and abrasions, while rust particles and dirt can fall into your eyes while you\u2019re working underneath.\nNext, all that heat tends to seize and corrode fasteners.

        "title": "What is Muffler Delete?",
        "content": "What is Muffler Delete and How Does It Work?\n\nA muffler delete is a custom modification made to a vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. It removes the muffler, which can improve both the performance and sound of the vehicle since it allows for the exhaust gases to freely escape, increasing airflow and boosting power output.\nThe absence of a muffler also produces a louder, sportier note from the exhaust. However, there still needs to be an exhaust system on the vehicle, so a straight exhaust pipe is installed in the muffler\u2019s place. Without it, exhaust gases would be released directly under your car, creating a racket that would drive you insane and fumes could seep into the cabin, making you sick.\n\nBenefits of a Muffler Delete\n\nA muffler delete can provide a variety of benefits, depending on how it is implemented. It has the potential to improve the performance of a vehicle due to the absence of a restrictive exhaust system, allowing more power to be obtained from the car. Additionally, you may enjoy an exhaust sound you\u2019d like better as a result of removing the muffler and allowing for a higher range of exhaust notes, both high and low, produced by your engine.\nInstalling a muffler delete can also be relatively cost-effective compared to other modifications with prices typically ranging from around $100 to $500. However, you should be aware that there can be downsides associated with this modification.\n\nPotential Risks of a Muffler Delete\n\nMuffler delete mods come with certain risks that must be understood before deciding to take the plunge.\n\nThe most significant risk associated with a muffler delete is an increase in noise pollution. Without the muffler, exhaust noises typically increase significantly and can disturb neighbors or other drivers on the road.\nIt can put you at risk for citations from law enforcement for excessive noise levels.\nThere\u2019s long been theories that removing your muffler or other exhaust components completely can lead to too low of back-pressure, which can cause either performance issues, or burned exhaust valves. Although there are contrasting opinions on this, we recommend proceeding with caution!\n\nUnderstanding the risks associated with a muffler delete should be carefully considered before attempting this modification.\n\nThe Legality of Muffler Deletes\n\nInstalling a muffler delete kit may seem like a great way to improve the performance of your vehicle but it\u2019s important to understand any potential legal implications first. In some states, operating a vehicle with no exhaust system can be illegal and you could be subject to fines or other charges. More than 20 states prohibit driving a vehicle that emits what they consider to be \u201cexcessive or unusual noise\u201d, while another 15 states or so prohibit modifying your muffler so that it creates more noise than the factory exhaust.\nEven in states where this modification is allowed, modifications must be made in accordance with emission control regulations. If you\u2019re subject to smog checks, there\u2019s a high likelihood your vehicle would fail. As such, it\u2019s important to do your research first and check if installing this type of system is legal in your state and county before purchasing and installing a muffler delete kit.\n\nWhat Type of Vehicle is Best Suited for a Muffler Delete?\n\nFor those looking to add a bit of extra power and sound to their vehicle, a muffler delete is an excellent choice. Generally, large capacity engines are best suited for a muffler delete. The general rule of thumb is that the larger the engine size is, the better it\u2019ll perform with this mod. This is due to the fact that these types of vehicles already have higher levels of air intake as well as exhaust output. As such, they benefit more from a muffler delete than smaller engine sizes.\nTo summarize, muffler delete is a modification to enhance its performance and sound. The key benefits it offers are increased horsepower, better sound quality, and reduced backpressure. However, the adverse side effects of these modifications need to be taken into consideration since they may have negative results.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "How to replace a muffler\n\nThe muffler replacement process starts with understanding the warning signs of when it might be time to switch out mufflers. Knowing the signs of a bad muffler, a muffler replacement cost estimate, and the steps to change a muffler can help you move further in the process.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere\u2019s the information you need to get started.\n\nSigns of a bad muffler\n\nCar exhaust pipe smoke\nThere are ways you can tell if a muffler needs replacement. Here are a few signs you can look out for:\n\nAmplified noise \u2013 Mufflers help keep your engine from making too much noise. If this isn\u2019t happening, it may mean that your muffler isn\u2019t working properly and needs to be looked at or replaced.\nPhysical damage \u2013 Have you noticed any rust or holes in your muffler? If so, your muffler may have experienced damage from water or debris and needs a change.\nBad odor \u2013 If you notice a strong smell coming from your ventilation system, it could be that the exhaust is leaking. This could be a sign of your muffler wearing down.\n\nHaving to make more trips to the gas station \u2013 Mufflers support your exhaust system, which helps to support your gas efficiency. A decreased fuel efficiency points to a potential muffler issue.\n\nThese are just some of the issues that could point to a potential muffler problem. Identifying these can help you decide whether to take your muffler to be replaced professionally or handle it yourself.\n\nHow much does it cost to replace a muffler?\n\nSo, how much does it cost to replace a muffler? The total expenses will depend on whether you try to do it yourself, the type of muffler you need for your car\u2019s make and model, and any additional equipment required. For example, suppose you want to take care of replacing a muffler yourself, and you already have the necessary tools. In that case, you may only have to pay for the muffler\u2019s cost (which can vary between $15 and or in the hundreds, depending on the type of muffler you need).\nBut, if you decide to take it in to have a professional replace your muffler, you could have to pay an additional $100 or more for labor and parts. Without taxes and any fees, you could be facing costs between $150 and $800 depending on the parts needed and the type of vehicle you have.\n\nHow to replace a muffler on your car\n\nMuffler under vehicle\nIf you\u2019re interested in tacking muffler replacement yourself, here are the steps to get started:\n\nFirst, you need to have the right tools. Here is a list of supplies you\u2019ll need to replace your muffler:\n\nThe muffler\nFloor jack\nLifting points\nSilicone lubricant\nSocket wrench\nWheel chocks\nSafety goggles\nWork gloves\nExhaust cutter\nPipe sealant\n\nSteps to Replace a Muffler\n\n1.

Disconnect the car battery\n\nTo ensure your car doesn\u2019t turn on while you\u2019re working, disconnect the car battery.\n\n3. Park and station your vehicle\n\nIt\u2019s important to park your vehicle on a flat surface. Then, secure it with wheel chocks to ensure your wheels are stationary and stay in place as you begin the next step.\n\n4. Lift the car and apply lift points\n\n You\u2019ll then carefully place a lift jack beneath your vehicle. Once you lift it to a sufficient height, you can then install lifting points under the car to keep it suspended while you work. \n\n5. Remove the old muffler\n\n Disconnect the bolts around the muffler clamps (use lubrication if needed to ease the bolts) using a socket wrench, cut it out of any existing piping, and remove the muffler hangers from the rubber muffler hanging mounts. While cutting away any connected piping, only cut the muffler\u2019s pipes.\n\n6. Measure the new muffler\n\nSee if the new muffler fits by measuring it against the current piping. If so, start installing the new muffler. You\u2019ll add the hangers to the rubber hanger mounts and connect the muffler to the new piping. Finally, spray exhaust sealant to connect the piping. Note that it may take a little while for it to take effect.\u00a0\n\n7. Reconnect the battery and check for leaks\n\nOnce the sealant has taken hold, reconnect the battery to your car and then run your vehicle to check for a muffler leak. If everything works properly, you\u2019re good to go!",

        "title": "Why Do People Steal Catalytic Converters?",
        "content": "Why Would Someone Steal a Cat Converter?\n\nCrooks love catalytic converters because they contain precious metals they can sell. Scrap yards offer around $200 for catalytic converters\u00a0and more for bigger, heavier ones.\u00a0How, then, does a thief remove a catalytic converter?\nCriminals usually use a\u00a0portable reciprocating saw\u00a0to remove it, aiming to take the converter off in less than\u00a0a few minutes.\nYou might not be able to know that your catalytic converter was taken by looking at your vehicle, but once you start it, the sound of gargling open exhaust (think massive muffler leak) will immediately make it apparent. It will be loud \u2013 very loud, and louder when you accelerate and get on the road.\n\nHow Much is a Stolen Catalytic Converter Worth?\n\nDepending on the precious metal, thieves could sell a converter to a metal recycler for around $200. The recycler then removes the metal and resells it for over $5,000 per ounce. While there is no official record of catalytic converter thefts nationwide, crime is rising dramatically, increasing metal costs.\nThe unlucky auto owner will need to shell out $1,000 or more for a converter installation. If the\u00a0thief\u00a0breaks\u00a0any additional exhaust components, such as cutting the oxygen sensors or destroying other exhaust work, expect the cat converter replacement cost to go up.\n\nHow to Prevent Catalytic Converter Theft\n\nPreventing converter theft can be difficult. One thing to keep in mind is that the process of\u00a0sawing\u00a0a converter off is not quiet. Most thieves\u00a0choose to do these in open parking lots at night, away from close detection. Fleet vehicles or trucks parked in open lots are often prime targets. Some thieves\u00a0have become bolden though and\u00a0have\u00a0begun attacking neighborhoods. Use these tips to help prevent converter\u00a0theft:\n\nPark close to entrances and in well-lit areas.\u00a0If you need to park your car in an open lot, choose an area\u00a0close\u00a0to the main road where\u00a0passers-by might see thieves trying to steal it. If you notice cameras in the lot, park near them\nPark your vehicle inside your garage, making sure to shut and lock the garage doors.\u00a0If this cannot be done, avoid parking your truck or\u00a0SUV\u00a0especially farther away from the house \u2013 keep it close\nInstall an aftermarket alarm that can sense vibration\nInstall one of many\u00a0available outdoor and night-vision security cameras and aim the camera at your parking area. While this may not prevent a thief from trying (no different than package thieves) it will give\u00a0authorities\u00a0video evidence\u00a0that could help them find the perpetrator\nUse your landscaping and other lower-riding vehicles to your advantage. Remember, a thief\u00a0has to\u00a0be able to easy get under more-desireable\u00a0vehicles like SUV\u2019s and Trucks. These thieves do not have time to jack a car up. For instance, if you have Truck and a lower car, and\u00a0one side of your driveway has a retaining way, or hedge bushes, park your truck as close to that side as possible, and the car as close to the truck at the side. While they may not prevent theft,\u00a0generally thieves\u00a0are going to\u00a0choose\u00a0easy targets.\u00a0You\u00a0have to\u00a0out-strategize the thief!",

        "title": "What Black, Blue, or White Smoke from a Car's Exhaust Means",
        "content": "The Workings of Your Exhaust System\n\nSeveral problems with your engine can cause excessive or abnormal smoke production.\nThe fuel that burns in each of your car\u2019s engine cylinders produces exhaust gases. The gases leave your engine through valves before flowing through the exhaust manifold, the catalytic converter, and out the muffler / tailpipe.\u00a0When all parts of the exhaust system work as they should, the gases that leave your tailpipe will have no color. But a problem with the process will result in a visible cloud of smoke behind your car.\nExhaust smoke from vehicles that use gasoline as a fuel source can appear in multiple colors. The most common colors for this smoke are black, white, or a\u00a0grey/blue color.\u00a0Diesel, because it has a\u00a0higher oil base, can generally be black and sooty, especially when accelerating under\u00a0high-load.\n\nWhat Different Colors of Exhaust Smoke Mean\n\n1. White Smoke\n\nWhite smoke is water vapor or another chemical vapor. Because all exhaust systems produce some amount of water vapor, this will be more evident on a cold day, where you see cars all streaming a small amount of water vapor in the exhaust behind them. All exhaust has some level of water vapor, and this is especially true when you first start your car for the day. If the white smoke coming from your exhaust system becomes excessive and persists in all temperatures, coolant may be leaking into the engine\u2019s combustion chambers.\nIn these cases, a head gasket failure or cracked block is normally the cause. There are other times that gaskets on a part like an intake manifold can cause a leak of coolant into the combustion chamber, but this is less likely. The function of a head gasket is to seal combustion chambers, but also act as a seal between the water passages of the block, and the head. Any problem with a head gasket will and can allow coolant into the combustion chamber or an oil passage. Once this happens, a sweet-smelling, white smoke is likely to exit your tailpipe in the form of coolant being burned. At the same time, your coolant level will fall with no visible leaks anywhere, which is a dead giveaway of a head gasket issue. To fix a head gasket is a major repair, and is outlined further in our article about head gasket repair. A cracked cylinder head is another possible cause of the white smoke coming through your tailpipe, which is similar to a head gasket in that a crack in a coolant passage will and can also leak coolant into the combustion chamber. In turbocharged vehicles, some turbos anyway, lack of coolant in the system can also cause overheating, which causes further damage and issues.\nFor DIY diagnosis, the next step would be to pressure-test the coolant system and determine where the coolant is going or coming from. This will determine if further engine tear-down is needed, and where.\n\n2. Black Smoke\n\nBlack smoke from the exhaust appears when the air/fuel ratio entering the engine is too rich with fuel. This can be caused by too much fuel entering the combustion chamber, or not enough air. Usually, the issue revolves around fuel. This can be anything from a faulty fuel pressure regulator letting too high of fuel pressure pass through the system, to a leaking fuel injector. This could also be a faulty engine sensor, such as an O2 sensor. In most of these cases, a check engine light will follow, telling you that the system is running rich, and will tell you if a sensor isn\u2019t functioning properly.\nIn older, carbureted vehicles, this same rich condition is caused from a carburetor not being properly adjusted, or defective parts within the carburetor.\nIn Diesel engines, fast acceleration and engine load is often met by the engine\u2019s system over-fueling, which can lead to black smoke appearing on acceleration. In diesel engines, this is very normal, even to the point where high-performance turbo diesel engines can produce a ton of black smoke on acceleration, which led to the industry moniker of \u201crolling coal\u201d. \nIn a gas engine though, a rich condition inside the combustion chamber will eventually foul out spark plugs, ruin the catalytic converter, and leave massive carbon deposits in the combustion chamber. Ultimately, engine performance will suffer, and eventually, more serious damage can and will follow. The good news with most modern engines is that chasing down the problem will be done with partial clues in the form of Check Engine Lights. Everything going on in the engine, the various engine sensors will know, and will report. At that point, it is a matter of pinpointing the problem and fixing it.  \n\n3. Blue, Gray, or Other Colors of Smoke\n\nIn addition to the black and white smoke from exhaust systems that can signal problems with your car, a mix of other smoke colors can exit through your tailpipe. Bluish gray or grayish-white smoke is an indicator that your engine is burning oil. This produces a foul burnt oil smell to all the cars behind you, and if you\u2019re one of those cars following someone who\u2019s burning oil, you\u2019re quickly reaching for the A/C recirculation button in your car to stave off the horrible smell.\nBurning oil can be caused by a few different problems. All engines consume a small amount of oil no matter what, but excessive consumption of oil is usually seen in the exhaust as bluish-tinted smoke. Bad valve seals are one of the biggest culprits, but worn-out piston rings, valve guides, a plugged PVC valve or crankcase ventilation system, and even over-filling the crankcase with oil can all lead to oil consumption. The easiest thing to check, of course, is the oil level. Over-filling your oil can be just as bad as under-filling, so be sure your oil is at the correct level. With all the other variants of oil consumption, you will need to take a deeper dive into the engine to determine what\u2019s causing the problem.\nFor DIY diagnosis, the next step would be a compression and leakdown test to determine whether the piston rings, or valve guides are causing an issue. Inspection of the crankcase ventilation system, and the PCV valve must be done to determine that the system is properly ventilating between the crankcase and the intake. Valve seals can be visually inspected for wear, and if necessary, replaced even if the head/s remain on the engine.\n\nGet Professional Help\n\nWith engine diagnosis, sometimes a professional hand is needed.

        "title": "Why Is My Check Engine Light On?",
        "content": "Understanding the Check Engine Light\n\nThe Check Engine Light, often abbreviated as CEL, is a critical part of your vehicle\u2019s onboard diagnostics system. It\u2019s essentially your car\u2019s way of communicating with you. When this light illuminates on your dashboard, it\u2019s indicating that the Engine Control Unit (ECU) has detected a problem or irregularity in one or more of the many systems it monitors.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that the Check Engine Light doesn\u2019t pinpoint the exact issue. Instead, it serves as a general warning sign that something is amiss. To get to the root of the problem, you\u2019ll need to perform a diagnostic scan using a code reader to retrieve specific trouble codes. It generally indicates the direction you need to take to get to the bottom of your symptoms.\u00a0\n\nVisit Your Local AutoZone Store for Free Fix Finder Service\n\nVisit an AutoZone Near You!\n\nCommon Reasons for Check Engine Light Activation\n\nThe causes behind a Check Engine Light activation can vary widely, but some common culprits include:\n\n1. Loose or Faulty Gas Cap\n\nYour\u00a0gas cap\u00a0is part of a sealed evaporative emissions system that recirculates gasoline vapors from your gas tank and keeps them from escaping into the air. Because of this, this system of lines and valves is closely monitored, and one of the key sealing pieces of this is the gas cap.\nIf you leave your gas cap off accidentally, it won\u2019t take long before the diagnostic system sets Check Engine Light codes. These leaks in the EVAP emission control system are often grouped as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d leaks. Its important to note that the problem is not always the gas cap, but could be one of the plastic recirculation lines, fittings, or connectors causing the leak, but more often than not, the gas cap is the culprit.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou can lose fuel through evaporation.\nYour recirculation system will not function properly.\nYou will have to stare at the CEL until it\u2019s fixed.\n\n2. Oxygen Sensor Issues\n\nYour\u00a0oxygen sensor\u00a0measures the amount of unburned oxygen in your vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. It indicates how thoroughly the air-fuel mixture burned during the combustion process.Oxygen sensors also live a hard life in +800-degree exhaust temps and are prone to fail over 80,000 miles or more. It\u2019s important to note here that there are a multitude of engine codes where the oxygen sensor indicates something is wrong, not necessarily that the oxygen sensor is bad. Be careful determining that a sensor is truly at fault, as opposed to determining something else is happening. This cannot be more apparent than in the ever-popular\u00a0PO420 / PO421 engine code, which is detailed HERE.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour engine will burn more fuel than needed.\nYou will lose fuel economy, and get fewer miles per gallon.\nFaulty sensor(s) can cause damage to your spark plugs and catalytic converter.\n\n3. Engine Misfires\n\nIf your car is misfiring, you probably aren\u2019t wondering to yourself \u201cWhy is my check engine light on?\u201d Your\u00a0spark plugs\u00a0ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of your vehicle, but if the timing of that spark, the mixture of the fuel and compression of the mixture isn\u2019t perfect, you will get a misfire. Multiple issues can cause a misfire, either on one cylinder or a multiple cylinder misfire.\n\nDefective ignition coil:(either DIS or coil-on-plug). A quick trick to determine if a coil is causing a misfire is to simply move the coil and swap with another on the engine. If you have a #2 misfire and move the #2 coil to cylinder #4, for example, then the misfire moves to #4, you know the coil is suspect.\nDefective fuel injector: If a fuel injector fails to deliver the proper amount of fuel to a cylinder, you will have a misfire. Unlike swapping the ignition coil with a neighboring coil, a fuel injector is more difficult to move.\nVacuum leak:\u00a0Vacuum leaks often cause multiple cylinder misfires, or lean running conditions. They also can be very difficult to diagnose.\nWorn spark plugs and/or wires: Sometimes, spark plugs can go far past their life cycle and fail, causing a misfire. On vehicles with\u00a0spark plug wires, a defective wire or wires can also cause this. For many drivers with older cars, it\u2019s a likely reason the Check Engine Light came on.\nBad compression:\u00a0A burnt or bent valve, worn piston rings, or valve timing that is off will cause a misfire as well. These issues are more serious and will all become apparent during an engine compression test.\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou will experience poor performance (reduced power, engine missing) and reduced fuel economy.\nThe misfire will only get worse, and will lead to mechanical failure in the engine.\n\n4. Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) Troubles\n\nYour\u00a0mass airflow sensor\u00a0(MAF) measures the amount of air entering the engine to determine how much fuel is needed to run your engine properly. If there are any leaks before or after the mass airflow sensor in the intake tract, a light can trigger. Mass airflow sensors are sensitive to oil, dirt, and water vapor, and any contamination on them can trigger a light. Sometimes, cleaning the sensor with intake or mass airflow sensor cleaner can fix the issue. Other times, the sensor needs to simply be replaced. Be sure to check the intake ducting carefully for leaks, rips, or damage.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nA faulty MAF sensor can cause rich or lean conditions, which can lead to further failures of other parts.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\n\n5. Catalytic Converter Issues\n\nYour\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0helps protect our environment by superheating hydrocarbons and other harmful tailpipe emissions into compounds like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Your downstream oxygen sensors carefully monitor the converter\u2019s performance, and if something goes awry, a number of trouble codes based on \u201cCatalyst efficiency\u201d will appear.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a catalytic converter will more than likely not fail on its own. Generally, something causes it to fail or not perform properly. Because of this, simply replacing the converter or the oxygen sensors around it will often not fix the problem, and often leads to yet another failed converter. Things as serious as a blown head gasket can force burned coolant vapor into the exhaust, triggering a catalyst engine code.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour vehicle will not pass an emissions test.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\nWhatever caused the converter to fail initially will continue to get worse, possibly causing engine failure.\n\nInterpreting Check Engine Light Codes\n\nWhen the Check Engine Light comes on, it\u2019s time to connect an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner to your vehicle. This scanner retrieves diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that provide clues about the issue. These codes consist of a letter followed by numbers, such as P0420. The letter indicates the affected system, while the numbers provide further details.\nUnderstanding these codes is crucial to pinpointing the problem accurately. You can consult your vehicle\u2019s service manual or use online resources to interpret the codes. While a specific code might suggest a particular issue, further diagnosis may be needed to confirm the exact problem.\n\nDiagnosing and Addressing Minor Issues\n\nFor minor issues like a loose gas cap or a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, you may be able to address them yourself. In the case of a loose gas cap, simply tightening it can make the light disappear after a few driving cycles.\nReplacing an oxygen sensor or spark plugs can be a DIY project for those with some mechanical know-how. Just be sure to use the right parts and tools and follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nSerious Problems and Check Engine Light\n\nIn some instances, the Check Engine Light can indicate more severe problems. Issues like a failing catalytic converter or a malfunctioning transmission can trigger the light, and diagnosing what\u2019s the root cause isn\u2019t always clear. Attempting to tackle these complex repairs without the necessary skills and equipment can lead to costly mistakes, so you might want to get a professional to weigh in on it.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring the Check Engine Light\n\nIgnoring the Check Engine Light is not a wise choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDecreased fuel efficiency. Many issues that trigger the Check Engine Light can reduce your vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency, costing you more at the pump.\nIncreased emissions. A poorly performing engine can produce higher emissions, contributing to environmental pollution.\nEscalation of problems. What might start as a minor issue can escalate into a major, more expensive problem if left unaddressed.\nSafety concerns. In some cases, the Check Engine Light can illuminate due to safety-related issues, such as a faulty airbag system or braking system. Ignoring these warnings can compromise your safety on the road.\n\nDIY Troubleshooting vs. Professional Assistance\n\nKnowing when to DIY and when to seek professional help is crucial. If you\u2019re comfortable with basic maintenance tasks and the issue seems minor (like a loose gas cap), DIY troubleshooting may be appropriate.\u00a0\nHowever, for more complex issues or if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to consult a qualified mechanic or technician who can accurately diagnose and repair the problem. If you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\n\nTips for Preventing Unnecessary Check Engine Light Activation\n\nWhile not all Check Engine Light activations can be prevented, you can take steps to reduce the likelihood:\n\nRegular maintenance. Follow your vehicle\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule, which includes oil changes, air filter replacements, and spark plug checks.\nTighten the gas cap. After refueling, make sure to tighten the gas cap securely to prevent evaporation of fuel vapors.\nDrive responsibly. Avoid aggressive driving, which can strain your engine and lead to premature wear and tear.\nUse quality fuel. Choose reputable gas stations and use quality fuel to maintain your engine\u2019s health.\n\nThe Check Engine Light is your car\u2019s way of alerting you to potential issues. Understanding its significance, interpreting the codes it generates, and taking appropriate action can save you time, money, and stress in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "The Role of Exhaust Systems\n\nBefore you can diagnose exhaust leak symptoms, you need to know how the system works. Your car\u2019s exhaust system plays a simple function, which sometimes can seem complicated. The primary role of the exhaust system is to direct the gases from the combustion chamber to a safe place. In your vehicle, the safest place is outside the car, and out the back. When directed inside your car, gases from the combustion chamber can be harmful\u00a0because they carbon monoxide, which is very dangerous to breath in. It is the main reason why\u00a0exhaust typically exits the rear of the car, as far away from the passengers as possible.\nThe secondary purpose of the exhaust system is to muffle sounds from the engine and keep the driving experience quiet \u2013 which is what most consumers want. The\u00a0route that the exhaust takes\u00a0can be complicated, and it gets extremely hot\u00a0during operating temperature.\u00a0The temperatures of the system can get up to 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit\u00a0the closer to the engine you get. The high\u00a0and constantly changing\u00a0temperatures\u00a0(called thermo-cycling)\u00a0cause\u00a0massive stress\u00a0on the components. Water is also\u00a0byproduct of combustion in your car\u2019s engine.\u00a0You may never see it, except on a cold day, but\u00a0water exits the system as vapor. During cold days or long times between start up, water vapor can condense within the exhaust system, which ultimately leads to corrosion. Couple this with outside elements (water, snow, salt) and you have an exhaust system that is slowly deteriorating.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo accomplish its goals, the exhaust system requires some parts. Heat shields, pipes, mufflers, flexible joints, and unions are some compulsory features of an exhaust system. The exhaust system of your vehicle has a tough life. Thus, over time,\u00a0components of it will\u00a0need to be replaced or repaired. Some of the repairs are easy, while others need professional expertise.\n\nHow to Find Exhaust Leaks\n\nUse this as a guide on how to find exhaust leak issues. The first step in repairing an exhaust leak is identifying the source of the problem. Since the exhaust pipes get\u00a0very hot, a best practice if trying to isolate a leak is to do it while the vehicle is cold. Never touch the exhaust system if you have been driving the car\u00a0under operating temperature. A visual inspection is the first step. Pop the hood and inspect the exhaust manifold, if you can see it.\u00a0Many times, it is covered with a heat shield, but an exhaust manifold can leak in 3 areas \u2013 the mounting surface (gasket) where it joins the engine, the gasket where the downpipe, or catalytic converter attach,\u00a0or the manifold itself can crack and cause a leak. Listen carefully near the top of the manifold. An exhaust leak typically sounds like a sharp in-rhythm \u201ctick\u201d sound.\u00a0Many people confuse an exhaust leak at the manifold with an engine knock, or lifter noise, but\u00a0often times, it\u2019s an exhaust leak. If the ticking sound appears to be lower down on the engine, it\u2019s likely the flange gasket connecting the manifold to the down pipe, or catalytic converter.\u00a0It\u2019s best here to put the vehicle on ramps and remember \u2013 check only with the vehicle cold! Listen and inspect where the exhaust pipe has connections. Since the vehicle is cold, you can carefully take your hand and feel the air around the pipe connection. Remember, don\u2019t touch! If there\u2019s an exhaust leak, you will feel the air pulsing out of the leak.\nUnder the car, there are several common exhaust components that can fail.\u00a0Many vehicles have what is referred to as a flex-pipe in the exhaust system. This pipe has a flexible\u00a0metal\u00a0interior,\u00a0similar to\u00a0an accordion,\u00a0with a woven, stainless steel fabric around out. Over time, these flex-pipes fail and can leak. A failed flex-pipe\u00a0is easy to spot and creates a good deal of exhaust noise. Another common failure is flexible flange joints. Flange joints where were 2 pieces of exhaust pipe\u00a0are\u00a0joined together. A non-flexible joint uses a gasket between the\u00a0two flat flanges\u00a0to bolt\u00a0together\u00a0and make a seal. While these can fail, they are not as common as flexible joints for failure.\u00a0The majority of\u00a0flexible exhaust joints use a spring flange with a large \u201cdonut\u201d gasket, which allows for flexing as the car moves. Many times, these flexible joints fail, and\u00a0often times, it\u2019s the donut gasket that deteriorates.\u00a0Other common failure points are the muffler and catalytic converter.\u00a0Check for any holes or sections where the\u00a0muffler has rusted\u00a0through, or\u00a0has come apart.\u00a0Often times, a catalytic converter will fail because the honeycomb element inside of it breaks\u00a0apart, and\u00a0begins to rattle.\u00a0Resonators, which are essentially a secondary muffler farther down than the initial muffler, can also fail, rust, and break open.\u00a0\u00a0As you carry out the inspection, pay close attention to the\u00a0exhaust pipe and look for any broken rubber hangers, or pipe that has a considerable amount of rust. Most OEM exhaust systems in the last 15 years are made from stainless steel now, but some are not. If you see heavy rust\u00a0in particular areas\u00a0on the pipe,\u00a0these areas may be suspect for failure soon. You can\u00a0take a pair of large pliers and gently squeeze those areas \u2013 if the pipe flexes or compresses \u2013 it is very thin and needs attention.\u00a0On any areas, a common sign of an exhaust leak is black soot. If you see it on any connection, or any areas of the pipe, muffler, or other components, there is a leak.\n\nSymptoms of an Exhaust Leak\n\nThe exhaust system works for you and your car\u2019s safety. If damaged, the dangerous fumes from your car\u2019s exhaust system can leak into the passenger cabin. You could be at risk of inhaling poisonous gases. If you suspect a leak in your car\u2019s exhaust system, don\u2019t hesitate to visit an auto repair shop. When you know what to look for, you can manage the exhaust leak repair. Here are common exhaust leak symptoms:\nWhen the exhaust of your car is leaking near the manifold, the efficiency of your vehicle could decrease by 3-4 mpg. This can happen because the leak\u00a0bypasses\u00a0the sensors that read incoming and outgoing oxygen. Thus, an excessive amount of fuel is burned.\u00a0To maximize your fuel\u00a0economy, fix any exhaust system leaks immediately.\u00a0If you\u00a0a tapping, ticking, or raspy noise under car or in front of you in the engine compartment\u00a0as you accelerate, your exhaust pipe could be leaking. Since the fumes escape at high velocity, even minor leaks will cause a\u00a0noise, or worse yet, vibration. More significant leaks will cause worse vibrations. The vibrations can be felt on the floorboards and the steering wheel\u00a0and will be more pronounced as you accelerate harder.\u00a0\nHow to Fix Exhaust Leaks\n\nIf you discover an exhaust leak from the manifold or the joints, you can seal the leaks by changing\u00a0out\u00a0the\u00a0failed\u00a0gasket. Every joint\u00a0that is made to be\u00a0separated\u00a0on the exhaust system has\u00a0some form of a\u00a0replaceable gasket.\u00a0Keep in mind,\u00a0the\u00a0nuts/bolts\u00a0that hold these joints together\u00a0can be\u00a0extremely\u00a0rusty, making it a hard task to remove them. It\u2019s a good idea to pre-soak any bolts in penetrating oil \u2013 usually a day before you plan on working.\u00a0Keep in mind that exhaust bolts can\u00a0have a tendency to\u00a0break, so when loosening, if you begin to feel heavy resistance, switch to tightening\u00a0the bolt by \u00bc turn, spray a bit of penetrating oil, and loosen again. Continue this process slowly back and forth if you encounter any resistance.\nWhen fixing any leak at a joint \u2013 especially a flexible joint with a donut gasket \u2013 make sure that the area and sealing surfaces are completely clean.\u00a0Often times, old gasket material is difficult to remove, and will need a\u00a0good scraper or wire brush to completely remove. When removing gasket\u00a0material\u00a0in a ball/cup style flex flange, using a wire brush that attaches to a drill works well to clean and smooth this area.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEpoxy bonds and tapes can also be used to\u00a0temporarily fix\u00a0exhaust leaks. However, before applying them, clean and smooth the leaking surfaces. An aluminum patch will toughen the epoxy bonds. Once you are\u00a0through, wrap the area with exhaust tape.\u00a0Keep in mind, many of these repairs may last some time, but they are all meant to be emergency repairs. Replacement of the component will be\u00a0necessary.\nIf you suspect a leak in your exhaust system, have it checked right away for your car\u2019s safety and your health. Exhaust fumes are dangerous when they get into the passengers\u2019 cabin. They can result in significant health risks.

        "title": "How Much Does a Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost?",
        "content": "What it Does\nIn simplest terms, a\u00a0catalytic\u00a0converter shares a similar size and shape to a small muffler in your exhaust\u00a0and lives in the exhaust system just like a muffler. In some ways, it also helps to mute exhaust sounds, but that\u2019s not its purpose. Catalytic\u00a0converters were first introduced in the mid-1970\u2019s\u00a0as a way to\u00a0contain and help fully combust and convert items within the exhaust that prior to those times, were simply exiting into the atmosphere.\nA converter is composed of a metal can, much like a muffler. Inside that can\u00a0is a metallic honeycomb element that works to convert these hot exhaust gases into items that are less harmful to the environment as they move through the exhaust and out into the air. In cars built after 1995, a downstream\u00a0oxygen\u00a0sensor helps to monitor and make sure the\u00a0converter is performing properly.\nOver time, a catalytic converter can lead a rough life to failure. In Northern climates, salt spray and rust can lead to a complete corrosion of the body of the converter, and because of that, many now are made from stainless steel. This failure causes a massive exhaust leak, where many times one of the connecting flanges fails, giving you a complete exhaust leak and waking up every neighbor in your neighborhood when you start your car in the morning! On the inside, the honeycomb material can break down and fracture, causing a knocking or rattling sound from within the exhaust. This material can also become clogged and contaminated with soot, burned oil or antifreeze, and eventually cause a massive exhaust restriction or complete blockage. In\u00a0all of\u00a0these cases, a new catalytic converter will be needed, and\u00a0often times, a Check Engine Light will accompany this.\nTypes of Cat Converters\nThere are a few fitment options when it comes to catalytic converters:\nDirect-Fit Catalytic Converters:\u202fThese are built for your specific year, make, and model of vehicle for easy installation.\u00a0Universal Catalytic Converters:\u202fThese are not built for a specific vehicle, so they\u2019re a little more work to install.\u00a0\nThere are also a few options as far as performance goes:\nFederal:\u202fThese devices function according to the specifications laid out by the Federal\u00a0Government and\u00a0meet emissions standards in most states.\u00a0California or CARB:\u202fThese devices are built to meet the more stringent emissions standards laid out by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). These are needed in California and a few other states including New York, Colorado, and Maine.\u00a0\nMake sure to get a catalytic converter that meets your state\u2019s emissions guidelines, otherwise you won\u2019t pass emissions.\nHow Much Does a Catalytic Converter Replacement Cost?\nPart of the\u00a0scare and\u00a0frustration of\u00a0catalytic\u00a0converters\u00a0is the fact that prices for replacement vary wildly. The main difference in\u00a0lies within\u00a0direct-fit vs a universal fit unit. For many vehicles, a muffler shop can easily weld in a universal replacement converter for\u00a0$2-300.00. This is accomplished by cutting out the old converter from the exhaust section and welding or clamping in a new one. On many newer vehicles, the converter is often incorporated into either an elaborate down-pipe section from the engine, or incorporated into the exhaust manifold itself, and in these cases, a direct-fit converter is the only option.\nDirect-fit converters are generally bolt-on items, that are replaced by unbolting the flanges that attach\u00a0it and\u00a0bolting in a new unit. Because they are more complex, they are often very costly compared to their universal counterparts. For direct-fit options, a replacement can cost anywhere from\u00a0$300.00 to\u00a0$2,500.00, depending on the model, for just the cost of the part.\u00a0You should also think about labor costs, which could cost between $70 and $130 an hour\u00a0to install the converter. The time it takes to finish the job will vary depending on the specific vehicle involved.\nIf you do this job yourself, you\u00a0will save the labor costs, but many times, the actual cost of the catalytic converter is the expensive portion.\u00a0While the job can take some time, it\u2019s\u00a0often\u00a0not too difficult, especially if you buy a direct replacement catalytic converter.\nBad Catalytic Converter Symptoms\nLike any part, component, or accessory on a car, the catalytic converter won\u2019t last forever. It\u2019s important to recognize the warning signs that this part is dying and no longer doing its job effectively. If you need a new one, you can start researching the catalytic converter replacement cost, and explore different manufacturer\u2019s options.\u00a0\nSome signs it is time for replacement include:\nExhaust leak directly under the cabin of the vehicle or near the firewall.\u00a0You hear a rattling sound\u00a0directly under the cabin\u00a0when your car is\u00a0idling.\u00a0The check engine light is on.\u00a0You smell a foul rotten egg odor coming from the\u00a0exhaust. You may notice this as you drive, while you\u2019re in idle or when you\u2019re standing outside of your vehicle while it\u2019s running.\u00a0Loss of power or acceleration in the vehicle.\u00a0A mechanic diagnosing these issues may notice that the catalytic converter is hot or even glowing red.\nWhat Happens if You Ignore Problems\nAnytime you realize the catalytic converter\u00a0may be suspect, you need to take your vehicle to a mechanic right away. Don\u2019t let the catalytic converter repair cost scare you. This is not an issue you can put off for\u00a0a long period of time.\u00a0Other signs may come in other forms. For example, you may notice a big drop in your vehicle\u2019s fuel\u00a0economy.\nContinued problems can lead to a sluggish engine, engine damage, and engine failure.\u00a0Many times,\u00a0engine codes like\u00a0PO420\u00a0show\u00a0that the Catalytic Converter isn\u2019t functioning properly, but issues with engine performance could be causing this.\u00a0Addressing the concerns right away could save you a lot of stress and money. Even if you\u2019re lucky enough to avoid major engine problems, you can\u2019t legally drive a vehicle with a bad catalytic converter in many states.\u00a0In order to\u00a0register your car, most states require an emissions or smog test. Your car will fail this test if the catalytic converter is not in good shape.",

        "title": "Bad Oxygen Sensor (O2) Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Purpose of Oxygen Sensors\n\nMost vehicles on the road today have internal combustion engines. To generate the power necessary to move the vehicle, the engine burns a precise mixture of fuel and air. This process, of course, creates certain emissions. Both to improve engine efficiency and minimize emissions, vehicles manufactured after 1980 have at least one O2 sensor.\nWith few exceptions, automotive internal-combustion engines require a oxygen-to-gasoline ratio of 14.7:1. If there is not enough oxygen in the mixture, excess fuel sticks around after combustion. Mechanics call this a rich mixture. If the reverse happens, the phenomenon is known as a lean mixture. Both can wreak havoc on your vehicle\u2019s performance and gas mileage. Even worse, the wrong fuel mixture can result in serious engine damage.\nCar manufacturers place oxygen sensors in specific areas to ensure the fuel mixture is neither rich nor lean. The number of sensors in a vehicle, though, differs. Those with V6 and V8 engines typically have three. A car with a four-cylinder engine, on the other hand, may more commonly only have two.\nOperationally, O2 sensors are basic. If the fuel-to-oxygen ratio is off-balance, a chemical reaction creates voltage. This voltage sends information to the vehicle\u2019s\u00a0electronic control module. Thus, if the sensor is not working properly, the computer must guess the amount of fuel that is necessary. If the guess is incorrect, pollution and poor performance may be the result.\n\nSigns of a Faulty or Failing Oxygen Sensor\n\nCommon Check Engine Light Causes: Oxygen Sensor\nAn oxygen sensor does not have to fail completely to give you problems. On the contrary, even a failing O2 sensor (sometimes called a \u201clazy\u201d O2 sensor) may cause your car to have a few issues. If you notice any of the following signs, you may have a bad O2 sensor or one that is about to go bad:\n\nAn illuminated check-engine light\nA rough engine idle\nA misfiring engine\nWorsening fuel economy\nFailed emissions inspection\n\nEven if your car\u2019s engine is not exhibiting any of the above oxygen sensor symptoms, it may still be time to replace your existing ones. In simple terms, O2 sensors are designed to wear out over time. As such, if your vehicle has driven 60,000 to 100,000 miles on with its existing sensors, depending on make and model, you may want to consider replacing its O2 sensors before they fail. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual may specify a service interval you better understand when to preventatively install new sensors.\nThe following parameters may be helpful guideline for when to replace your oxygen sensors:\n\nModel years from the mid-1990s to present day, replace O2 sensors every 100,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s with heated three- and four-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 60,000 to 70,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1970s to early 1990s with unheated one- and two-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 40,000 to 50,000 miles\n\nDiagnostic Procedures\n\nIf you suspect your car has an old, damaged or ineffective oxygen sensor, you can likely either confirm or dispel your suspicions with an OBD-II scanner.\u00a0These scanners plug into your vehicle\u2019s computer and display diagnostic trouble codes. The exact error code for identifying a potentially faulty oxygen sensor, though, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Still, you should be able to glean enough information from the scanner\u2019s readout to determine if you have a sensor-related problem.\nNonetheless, you should realize that other problems may register the same diagnostic code as a faulty oxygen sensor. For example, you may have trouble with your vacuum system. As such, before replacing your O2 sensors, you likely want to inspect your vehicle\u2019s engine for other problems.\n\nReplacement Options\n\nIf you are unable to determine if you have a bad O2 sensor from your OBD-II scanner or a visual inspection, you likely want to take your vehicle to a reliable mechanic. You want to visit someone who has a diagnostic scan tool. This mechanic can tell you with virtual certainty whether you need to replace your O2 sensor. He or she also can likely pinpoint which oxygen sensor has failed.\nWhen it comes to replacing a faulty O2 sensor, you have a couple options. Because sensors are plug-and-play, you may be able to do the replacement yourself. That said, sensors are not always easy to access. Even worse, sometimes the old sensors can seize in place, making them very difficult to remove.\n\nTotal Cost\n\nThe total O2 sensor replacement cost depends on whether you do your job yourself. If you do, you only need to budget for the price replacement sensors, but you will need to clear the codes with an OBD tool (Rent through Loan-A-Tool\u00ae). This price, of course, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Many sensors, nonetheless, cost between $20 and $100. Your mechanic\u2019s labor costs also likely vary based on a few factors, including how difficult it is to access your sensors. Typically, labor costs for a sensor replacement are around $150.\n\nYour Next Step\n\nKeeping your vehicle\u2019s oxygen sensors in tip-top shape is critical. After all, if you have a bad or failing O2 sensor, you could get reduced gas mileage or even fail an emissions inspection.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "What Is the Catalytic Converter and What Does It Do?",
        "content": "What is a Catalytic Converter?\n\nYour catalytic converter, sometimes called the cat, uses a catalyst to convert the more harmful compounds of your engine\u2019s emissions. Typically, a combustion engine emits numerous harmful compounds. In order to protect the environment and prevent you and your family from being exposed to poisonous gases, every vehicle is required to have a catalytic converter in the emissions system.\nThe catalyst in your converter is typically made of palladium, rhodium, and platinum. These rare metals coat a ceramic interior, which is typically in a honeycomb or bead shape, and converts harmful gases into less harmful emissions.\nTypically, your catalytic converter converts approximately 90% of emissions, but there are a number of factors that can increase or decrease the efficiency. Converters are less efficient at converting cooler temperature emissions, so a diesel fuel or short driving distances may reduce the efficiency of your converter.\nA particulate filter can be added to catalytic converters to increase the efficiency to 99% by catching ultra-fine particles. Some OEM converters use a particulate filter, and many aftermarket options include this additional component.\n\nWhere is the Catalytic Converter?\n\nYour converter is part of your exhaust system. It\u2019s located between the intake manifold and your muffler. The exact configuration depends on the make and model of your vehicle and the exhaust system setup. Many vehicles today have multiple catalytic converts, as do any vehicles with dual exhaust, or partial dual exhaust as most V6 and V8 engines are.\n\nHarmful Emissions It Converts\n\nAs your internal combustion engine propels your car forward, it emits three main gases as a byproduct. Each of these gases are harmful either to your health, the environment or both. These are the three main compounds typically emitted by your engine:\n\nNitrogen oxides\nCarbon monoxide\nHydrocarbons\n\nSo, what does a catalytic converter do? Your catalytic converter converts carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide, and water and nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and oxygen.\nNitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons are both causes of smog in the environment. A buildup of nitrogen oxides can create acid rain. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that can be harmful or even fatal if breathed in.\n\nWhat are the Signs of a Failing Converter\n\nUnder normal operations, you can expect your converter to last up to 10 years or more. However, as your vehicle ages, engine symptoms can occur that can cause your converter to fail, or the outside elements can finally cause failure. Here are some common signs of a damaged or inefficient converter:\n\nExcessive heat under your vehicle\nFoul, sulfuric smells from your exhaust\nRattling noises from the exhaust, or exhaust leaks\nReduced engine performance and acceleration\n\nThese signs may point to a clog or damage to the internal structure. Over time, the honeycomb catalyst in your converter can become clogged or break up. This will not only reduce the efficiency of your catalyst but can completely stop exhaust gases from exiting your exhaust system. Once the catalyst is completely clogged, your engine may stall or extremely poorly as the exhaust has no way to exit the system.\nAlso, the elements of salt and corrosion can wear away at the outside of a converter, no different than a muffler. In many cases, the converter\u2019s protective heat shield is the first thing to go, which can cause a rattling in and of itself, while the entire casing of the converter can rust \u2013 no different than a muffler, and cause a bad exhaust leak.\n\nCleaning Your Catalytic Converter\n\nWhile there is a handful of methods, theories, and materials out there to physically clean your catalytic converter \u2013 from running items through your fuel system, ingested into the intake, or physically removing your catalytic converter from the vehicle and cleaning it in a solution bath, it\u2019s noted that none of these methods are proven to work 100%.\n\nDo I Even Need a Catalytic Converter?\n\nSince 1975, a catalytic converter has been required in all US vehicles. If you need to replace your catalytic converter be sure you choose a converter certified by the EPA. Operating your vehicle without a converter or with a faulty converter can be dangerous and illegal for on-road use.\n\nCan I Upgrade My Converter?\n\nA damaged catalytic converter needs to be replaced promptly. However, there are also some benefits of replacing your existing converter, even if it\u2019s functioning properly. An aftermarket catalytic converter provides you with a number of performance benefits in connection with other aftermarket tune-ups.\nHowever, don\u2019t expect a high-flow catalytic converter to provide exceptional performance benefits alone. An aftermarket converter is a great investment if your high-performance vehicle has other aftermarket components that have increased your horsepower 20% or more above OEM levels.\nWhile some aftermarket options may have a longer warranty, many options may not be as cost-effective as an OEM replacement. Ask a knowledgeable AutoZone associate to determine whether your car needs a new converter and whether to upgrade to an aftermarket option or stick with a reliable OEM option.\n\nFind Out More and Shop for a New Catalytic Converter Today\n\nIf you have more questions about this essential exhaust system component, or you need assistance in selecting the best replacement converter for your vehicle, don\u2019t hesitate to talk with an associate at your local AutoZone, or check out one of our preferred shops in your area that can help with the repair and diagnosis.",

        "title": "Why Your Car Could Fail an Emissions Test",
        "content": "How the Tests Work\n\nWhile some may question the integrity of emissions testing, the EPA and other regulatory bodies stand by the accuracy of this type of testing to manage the pollutants stemming from the exhaust system of your vehicle. There are two essential emissions tests: (1) the OBD or on-board diagnostic check and (2) the I/M240 dynamometer test. The OBD check is performed on vehicles from 1996 to current models. It essentially connects to the OBD system of newer cars and measures to see if all emissions equipment is working correctly. The I/M240 test is performed on vehicles manufactured between 1981 and 1995, and its tests are more involved. Utilizing a dynamometer that simulates driving on road conditions, the vehicles exhaust gases are captured and analyzed to determine a pass or fail.\n\nWhy Do Cars Fail Emissions Tests?\n\nWhen people buy a used car and are required by state law to take it in for testing, they can become anxious. After all, no one wants to purchase something and then be told they can\u2019t use it, or that it will cost them additional money to bring it up to code. However, while an emissions test may make you nervous, there are at least seven reasons that a failure may occur, and not all of these reasons are costly.\n\nTop Seven Reasons Why Cars Fail\n\n1. Loose or leaking gas cap\n\nAs failures go, a leaking gas cap is probably one of the least expensive problems to fix. Especially in older vehicles, the seals on gas caps can wear away, which can potentially lead to excessive fumes being released from the tank. However, you probably don\u2019t even need a mechanic to fix this issue, just purchase a new cap made for your make and model and install it.\n\n2. Dirty air filter\n\nHow long has it been since you replaced or even thought about cleaning your air filter? Honestly, cleaning or replacing the air filter should probably be one of the first things you do after purchasing a used vehicle. When these items are too dirty, they can lead to the production of high-levels of carbon monoxide, which can cause a failed emissions test.\n\n3. Worn spark plugs\n\nWhile small, spark plugs are among the most critical parts in your engine, unfortunately, they can also lead to a failed car emissions test. You should replace the spark plugs if they exceed their mileage interval. This will help restore performance and potentially better your gas mileage while lowering emission pollutants.\n\n4. Damage to the catalytic converter\n\nThe catalytic converter might be the most crucial piece of equipment in your engine when it comes to controlled emissions. The job of this device is to convert toxic gases into nontoxic emissions, thereby protecting the environment and public health. A damaged catalytic converter will most definitely cause a failed emissions test. Therefore, you\u2019d be better off getting it checked out before the test.\n\n5. EVAP defects\n\nA cars evaporative emission control or EVAP system ensures that gasoline vapors remain contained inside of the cars fuel tank. If this system is damaged, then harmful gases are released into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, since there are multiple hoses and vents that make up this system, the problem can be hard to track down, which can lead to costly repairs.\n\n6. Rich-running system\n\nA rich air-fuel mixture can also lead to an emissions test failure. The cause of such a rich-running system can be anything from a faulty oxygen sensor to malfunctioning injectors. However, it is essential to sort this issue out sooner rather than later to avoid damaging the catalytic converter. A rich-running system can dump excessive amounts of raw fuel through the system and damage or clog the catalytic converter.\n\n7. Defective check engine light\n\nUnfortunately, as accurate as the emissions test can be, there are times where a failure occurs in a system that is actually working correctly. There are times where a car will have a faulty or defective check engine light, which might cause a failed emissions test. Thankfully, these lights are often cheap fixes, but if you are unaware of the defect, you may spend a lot of time rooting out the problem.\n\nAvoiding\u00a0Failures\n\nThe only way to prevent an emissions test failure is to take care of your vehicle. Sticking to a proper maintenance and inspection schedule goes a long way. However, it is also essential to know your limitations. Many car owners think they can DIY their way through everything, and in many circumstances that is true; however, don\u2019t avoid professional inspections to ensure that any work or repairs you performed are up to par.",

        "content": "How to Upgrade to a High Performance\n\n1. Upgrade the Engine\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to look at your engine as a big air pump. The faster and better the air flows through the engine, the faster your car will move. One great upgrade that can help achieve this is a cold air intake system. Brands like Specter and K&N offer high-performance systems that replace the factory air filter and intake housing. This design reduces intake restrictions and allows for a larger amount of air to flow into the engine, resulting in more usable power and better acceleration.\n\n2. Upgrade the Exhaust System\n\nAnother way to increase horsepower is to improve the performance and sound of your exhaust system. Replacing the factory mufflers with high-flow performance mufflers from Flow Master or Magna Flow can make a significant difference. If you\u2019re not comfortable with cutting and welding, a local muffler shop can help with the installation. Another option is a cat-back exhaust system that replaces the factory system from the catalytic converters to the rear of the car. This upgrade can be done with simple hand tools and provides real performance gains.\nA full performance exhaust system can also free up some horsepower. There are two options to choose from \u2013 a bolt-on kit designed to fit your car or a universal kit from Flow Master that you can customize to fit your vehicle. The full system includes mandrel bends to reduce resistance and an option for a crossover pipe or an X pipe for scavenging. You can also choose the performance muffler that best suits your performance goals or desired sound. This is a heavy DIY project that requires cutting and welding, so a local exhaust shop can help if you\u2019re not comfortable with your skills.\n\n3. Upgrade the brakes\n\nIf you want a car that goes fast, then you better make sure it can stop fast, and upgrading your brakes is something that most of us can do. For performance, you want to look at your pads, calipers, and your rotors. And if you want a little extra flare, you can use some custom caliper covers, or go on to the full brake kit.\n\n4. Upgrade Tires & Handling\n\nYou have got to be able to control your car, especially when it\u2019s screaming at the top of its RPM range. You can really improve the handling with some performance tires, and you can get better feedback with a performance steering wheel. Most stock steering wheels are typically a larger diameter; they\u2019re made from molded plastic, and they can be hard to hang on to in extreme conditions. A smaller diameter wheel, covered in leather or suede give you better feedback, a better grip, and better car control.\n\n5. Upgrade fluids and chemicals\n\nHigh performance means high heat, and if you\u2019re dealing with high heat, you\u2019ve got to go with synthetic. One of the best benefits of synthetic oil is that the oil itself doesn\u2019t break down as fast. The viscosity stays the same for a longer period of time, and especially under extreme conditions. But it\u2019s not just your engine oil. Synthetic and performance fluids throughout your vehicle can free up horsepower with less friction, and better protect your parts under stress, all at the same time. \n\n6. Reprogram the system\n\nPower programmers are a simple and proven way to really wake up your car, providing power gains up to 30 horsepower or even more in some diesel applications. They use a data cable that connects the programmer to your car\u2019s computer by plugging into the car\u2019s diagnostic port of a \u201996 and newer vehicle. A programmer can access and change tuning data that controls air and fuel into your engine, timing events, even transmission shift points, and line pressures to give you more power and a better performance feel, better towing, and even better fuel economy, depending on how the programmer is set.",

        "title": "Is My Exhaust Manifold Leaking?",
        "content": "How an Exhaust Manifold Can Fail\n\n1. Gaskets\n\nAn exhaust manifold is bolted to the engine via a series of bolts or studs / nuts. This is sealed by a gasket made of high temperature material and metal. At the other end, an exhaust pipe or catalytic converter attaches to the manifold via a flange or donut gasket. On a turbocharged engine, the turbo is normally mounted directly to the exhaust manifold. Any of these gaskets can fail, creating a large exhaust leak right at the manifold. The good news here is that usually the manifold is OK \u2013 a gasket replacement will remedy the exhaust leak.\n\n2. Broken Mounting Studs\n\nMost exhaust manifolds are attached with mounting studs. Many of these studs also hold down other accessory brackets in and around the engine and are secured on the exhaust manifold with nuts. When removing these nuts, many times, the studs can break. Because it can be a vary labor intensive job to remove and replace broken studs, these missing fasteners are often left broken, which can then lead to a weak point in the gasket, and gasket failure. Broken mounting studs can also force the exhaust manifold\u2019s surface to warp, leading to cracks.\n\n3. Cracked Manifold\n\nMost exhaust manifolds are made out of cast iron, which is an excellent material to handle the constant heat expansion of getting hot and cold. Over time, however, cast iron is prone to crack, leading to an exhaust leak. Flanges can also crack or completely break off, specially at weld joints. In both cases, a manifold replacement is usually needed.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the ways an exhaust manifold can fail, and more importantly, address it immediately. If you need help with this job, search any one of our\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0in your area to help you complete the job.",

        "title": "Signs of a Bad Cabin Air Filter",
        "content": "What is a cabin air filter and is it important?\n\nThe cabin air filter is responsible for ensuring that the driver and passengers can breathe healthy cabin air. Developed to be effective against pollen, dust particles and other common allergens, cabin air filters are designed in such a way as to protect the cabin and the occupants from any potential contamination.\nThe filter itself typically fibers woven tightly together like paper, cotton, and synthetic fibers. The filter is folded so there are pleats, adding surface area to filter for a longer time, and at a higher degree. Many cabin air filters contain a layer of activated charcoal to neutralize odors.\nAs such, these filter systems need regular maintenance and occasional replacement in order to maintain efficiency. Neglecting this maintenance task can lead to numerous consequences including reduced visibility, odors, and HVAC issues.\n\nSymptoms of a clogged cabin air filter\n\nWhen a vehicle\u2019s cabin air filter becomes clogged or dirty, signs will begin to appear that will definitely affect how you can use your car:\n\nBad smells are common. An acrid smell coming from the vents, musty smells that linger in the cabin, and sour odors especially when the heat is on can be due to a bad cabin air filter.\nWindows don\u2019t clear properly. Windows and windshields fog up due to temperature and humidity differences between inside and outside air. The airflow needs to be strong enough that the blower motor can clear the fog, but a restricted cabin filter will cause it to struggle.\nThe interior is dirtier. Increased dust or debris coming from air vents when turned on can settle on your interior, making it look dirtier.\nThere\u2019s more fan noise. Debris can get caught in the blower motor, and it will operate louder anytime the fan is on.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you recognize these signs and replace your cabin air filter as soon as possible in order to prevent further consequences.\n\nThe consequences of not changing your cabin air filter\n\nNot changing your cabin air filter can have serious consequences for the health and safety of you and your passengers. Most importantly, a dirty cabin air filter allows more harmful particles like odors, soot, smoke and even exhaust fumes to enter the cabin \u2013 this can lead to negative health consequences for anyone travelling in your car.\nAlso, there\u2019s more strain on the HVAC system. When that happens, parts like the heater fan and the blower motor resistor are susceptible to overheating from excessive use, and they can fail.\nYou could get into an accident from poor visibility if your windshield is fogged up and won\u2019t clear. These types of collisions are completely avoidable with a minor maintenance item.\nSurprisingly, if the cabin air filter is dirty, it can also decrease your fuel efficiency. Since the HVAC system needs more energy to push air into the cabin, it demands more power from the engine, and the engine needs to burn fuel to accommodate. While the effect is minor, it is present.\nRegularly changing your cabin air filter can help prevent these serious issues from happening in the first place.\n\nHow to check if you need to replace your cabin air filter\n\nReplacing your cabin air filter is a simple yet important task that should be regularly performed. To check if you need to replace your cabin air filter, start by inspecting the airflow from the vents in your vehicle as well as for strange smells.\nYou can also physically examine the cabin air filter itself. Look for dust buildup, debris, bugs, or mold on the filter, or cracking around the edges. If any of these symptoms are present, replacing it is recommended as soon as possible. And if you haven\u2019t changed the cabin filter in 12 months, it\u2019s time to do so.\nYou should be aware of the importance of a cabin air filter, and how it can affect your car\u2019s performance. By understanding the symptoms a clogged cabin air filter can cause, it will be much easier to identify when you need a replacement. Clogged filters can lead to damage to the heating and cooling system, as well as other issues. Checking your filter regularly and knowing when you need to replace it is key to keeping your vehicle well functioning.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Engine Air Filter vs. Cabin Air Filter: What\u2019s the Difference?",
        "content": "What\u2019s the Difference Between a Cabin Air Filter and an Engine Air Filter?\n\nThe main similarity between the cabin air filter and engine air filter is their purpose. Both are designed to protect your vehicle from dust, dirt, pollen, and other potentially harmful contaminants that can enter through the air intake system. The key difference with these two types of filters lies in where they are located within your car: the engine air filter can be found near the front of your vehicle under the hood, while the cabin air filter is usually found inside the passenger compartment near either side or behind glove box.\nAnother difference between these two filters is their size. While the engine air filters are usually considerably larger than cabin air filters due to the higher airflow they need to handle, they also have a much more complicated design which allows them to trap particles effectively. Cabin air filters on the other hand tend to be much smaller in size and simpler in design as they need to neatly fit within a tight space in the dash. Although they\u2019re smaller, they\u2019re often designed to filter out tinier particles like pollen and other allergens, plus cabin air filters commonly contain odor-neutralizing carbon within its layers.\nFinally, one last difference is that engine air filters can often be cleaned or replaced relatively easily in the engine bay. Cabin air filters sometimes require professional replacement because of where they\u2019re situated, like behind the glove box compartment.\n\nHow Often Should Air Filters Be Changed?\n\nWhen it comes to engine air filters, the general recommendation is to replace them after every 15,000 miles or approximately once a year. This will ensure that there\u2019s enough clean air passing through your vehicle\u2019s engine to prevent decreased performance due to restricted airflow. It\u2019s also important to inspect the filter regularly and replace it if it appears dirty or damaged.\nAs for cabin air filters, they usually need replacing less often, depending on your climate and driving conditions. They help keep the passenger compartment free from pollutants by filtering out any contaminants, bad smells, or odors. While these filters don\u2019t have an exact mileage limit, they should still be inspected regularly so you\u2019ll know when they need replacing. And many carmakers have a replacement interval in the maintenance schedule of around once every two years.\n\nThe Effects of a Dirty Air Filter or Cabin Air Filter\n\nAn air filter that\u2019s beginning to get dirty will continue to operate normally. But as it gets very dirty, it gets more restricted and symptoms can appear.\nSigns of a dirty engine air filter include:\n\nReduced fuel economy. The dirty filter restricts airflow and lowers the amount of oxygen reaching the engine, and more fuel is used to compensate for it.\nReduced power and acceleration. Less airflow into the engine will hinder the combustion process, and you won\u2019t get the same performance and power you\u2019re used to.\nPopping noises or stumbling. If the air filter is badly clogged, the engine could struggle to run, causing a misfire.\nCheck Engine Light on. An engine starved of air will eventually cause trouble codes as the engine isn\u2019t operating as it should.\n\nFor a dirty cabin air filter, on the other hand, symptoms could be:\n\nPoor A/C and heating performance. Noticeably weaker airflow through the vents is due to a plugged filter, and the hot or cold air you want can\u2019t pass through as easily.\nA bad smell. Contaminants trapped in the filter can be breeding grounds for bacteria or mildew, and repulsive odors can flow through the vents.\nDecreased defrosting capacity. Like the heater performance, poor airflow can struggle to keep your windows clear of moisture.\nFan noises. The blower motor might have debris caught up in it from a packed cabin air filter.\n\nOf course, for either the cabin air filter vs engine air filter, a bunch of dirt, leaves, bugs, and other debris in the filter\u2019s pleats would be an indication that it should be changed.\n\nCan I Replace Air Filters Myself?\n\nIf you\u2019re a DIYer, you can definitely change both the cabin air filter and the engine air filter on your own. Under the hood, you\u2019ll find the air cleaner housing where the engine air filter resides. It\u2019s often held closed with clips or a few screws, and when it\u2019s open, the filter can be swapped in seconds.\nFor the cabin air filter, you\u2019ll need to locate it first. Most often, it\u2019s behind the glove box. With the compartment door lowered or removed, identify the hatch or door that keeps the filter in place. Remove it, pull the old filter out, and slide a new filter in before buttoning it all back up.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process. Spark plugs, ignition cables, and fluid flushes may be due. It\u2019s best to follow the maintenance schedule provided by the manufacturer for major services.\nIf you complete the items on this spring car checklist, you\u2019ll help minimize the overall cost of repairs and prevent untimely issues from occurring.

        "title": "Signs You Need a New Air Filter\u00a0",
        "content": "Signs you need a new air filter\u00a0\n\nThe engine needs approximately two and a half times its displacement in air to run efficiently every minute. At idle, a 2.0-liter gas engine needs around 25 cubic feet of clean air per minute, and that goes up commensurately when the RPMs do. To get that much clean air into the engine, the air filter needs to allow plenty of air to flow through it.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf it\u2019s restricted by contaminants, you\u2019ll begin to notice these symptoms of a dirty air filter.\u00a0\n\n1. Dirty filter\n\nWhen you inspect the air filter \u2013 which should be done at least every time the engine oil is changed \u2013 you might notice there\u2019s debris stuck between the filter pleats or there\u2019s dirt collecting on the material. Although some dirt and debris can be knocked loose or blown out with compressed air, the engine air filter should be replaced if you can\u2019t see a light source through the pleated material.\n\n2. Weird noises\n\nAn engine that\u2019s starving for clean air will begin to make strange noises at times. It could be a sputtering sound, coughing, or popping from the engine area. The limited air supply flowing into the engine throws the air-fuel mixture out of whack and the engine runs inefficiently, which can cause the noises you hear. There isn\u2019t enough air in the engine to thoroughly burn the fuel that\u2019s been injected.\n\n3. Check Engine Light\n\nThere isn\u2019t a sensor on the air filter itself to indicate that it\u2019s dirty, but there are other monitors that can insinuate decreased air intake. The mass air flow sensor, for example, could read lower levels of air entering the intake than normal, signalling potential air filter issues. The oxygen sensors in the exhaust can also determine that the combustion process isn\u2019t on par, which is often caused by a plugged air filter. When these parameters are outside the normal range, it can trigger a Check Engine Light to come on.\n\n4. Black smoke from exhaust\n\nBlack smoke from the tailpipe indicates an air-fuel mixture that\u2019s too rich; that is, the proportion of fuel to air is too high. When that happens, the fuel doesn\u2019t burn thoroughly before the exhaust stroke pushes it out of the combustion chamber, and the exhaust appears black, laden with unburned fuel.\n\n5. Unburned fuel smell from exhaust\n\nSimilarly, a raw fuel smell from the exhaust is one of the common clogged air filter symptoms. If it\u2019s badly blocked, the engine tries to compensate for a lack of performance by injecting more fuel to burn. When that happens and it doesn\u2019t burn completely, it can exit the tailpipe and you\u2019ll notice a fuel smell.\n\n6. Fuel economy is noticeably lower\n\nAs the fuel system compensates for restricted airflow, it dumps more gas into the engine to attempt to produce the power you need to drive. The amount of fuel burned is noticeably more than normal, and fueling up more often might be an indication you should check the air filter\u2019s condition.\n\n7. Hesitation or stumbling on acceleration\n\nSymptoms of a bad air filter can include decreased performance. If your car doesn\u2019t accelerate smoothly, it bucks and burps when you\u2019re cruising, or it stumbles and stalls when you\u2019re decelerating, it can all point to a dirty air filter.\n\nHow to Change an Air Filter\u00a0\n\nMost air filters take only a few minutes to remove and replace:\u00a0\n\nLocate the air filter housing.\u00a0\nUnclip or unscrew the housing to expose the air filter.\u00a0\nLift the old filter out. It might be a snug fit.\u00a0\nClean any dirt or debris from the housing to prevent the new filter from getting dirty prematurely.\u00a0\nSlip the new air filter into place in the same orientation as the old one.\u00a0\nFasten the housing to finish up.",

        "title": "How Often Should You Change Your Vehicle's Air Filters?",
        "content": "How long does an air filter last?\n\nAn engine air filter\u2019s job is to keep the engine clean by trapping contaminants before they can enter. They\u2019re made of pleated material, often a blend of natural and synthetic fibers, and they\u2019re sometimes reinforced. The material is intended to capture particles measured in microns, sometimes down to 5 or 10 microns, so they don\u2019t enter the engine and damage parts. They also need to be free flowing enough that the air isn\u2019t restricted entering the engine.\nOver time, the engine air filter becomes clogged and less effective. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to change your car\u2019s air filter regularly. Depending on your driving habits, you should change your air filter every 12 months or 12,000 miles. If you do a lot of stop-and-go driving in a dusty or polluted area, you\u2019ll need to change it more often. To save yourself some money, you can even do it yourself. Just be sure to buy the right filter for your car and follow the instructions to swap it out.\nCabin air filters should be changed at roughly the same intervals. Like the filter for engine air, they can get clogged with bugs, dirt, pollen, leaves, and other environmental particles. They can also get saturated by water and develop mold or mildew that can stink up your car. Changing it annually is always a good practice.\n\nWhen should you change an air filter?\n\nAside from the time and mileage recommendation, there can be other reasons to change your air filters. Here are some symptoms that can alert you to an issue that requires attention.\n\nSymptoms of a dirty engine air filter\n\nAlong with how often to change air filters, a dirty air filter can cause a number of problems that will affect your vehicle\u2019s reliability as well as your confidence at the wheel. They can include:\n\nReduced fuel economy.\nEngine misfires.\nIncreased emissions.\nHissing noise from under the hood at idle.\nEngine damage if it\u2019s left unaddressed.\u00a0\nCheck Engine Light on.\nYour car is idling rough.\nSlow acceleration.\n\nBy paying attention to these signs, you can ensure that your air filter is always clean, and your engine is always running smoothly.\n\nSigns your cabin air filter is dirty\n\nCabin filters are an important part of your vehicle\u2019s ventilation system, and they help to keep the air inside your cabin clean and free of pollen, dust, and other airborne contaminants. Over time, however, cabin filters can become clogged with dirt and debris, reducing their effectiveness, and potentially causing cabin air quality to deteriorate. If you notice that your cabin air quality has gone down, there is a putrid or rotten odor coming from the vents, or there is less air blowing from your dash vents, it may be time to replace your cabin air filter.\n\nHow to replace an air filter\n\nNeither an engine air filter nor cabin air filter is a complicated job to exchange. In most cases, you don\u2019t need any tools, or at most you will need a screwdriver to remove a duct or cover.\n\nReplacing an engine air filter\n\nReplacing your engine air filter is a simple task that you can do at home with just a few tools. Most cars will have the filter located in the engine bay, and it will be housed in a rectangular box. Once you have located the filter, open the box, and remove the old filter. Be sure to dispose of it properly; most filters can be recycled. To install the new filter, simply insert it into the box and close the lid. By replacing your filter regularly, you can help to keep your engine running smoothly and improve fuel efficiency.\n\nHow to replace a cabin air filter\n\nReplacing a cabin air filter is typically a straightforward process, but the exact steps may vary depending on your vehicle\u2019s make and model. In most cases, the cabin air filter is located behind the glove compartment or under the hood, and it can be accessed by opening the panel and removing the old filter. Once the old filter has been removed, simply insert the new filter in its place and close the panel. With a fresh cabin air filter in place, your vehicle\u2019s cabin will be refreshed and free of any unwanted contaminants.\n\nIf you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\u202f\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "The Best Oil Filter for Your Vehicle - A Buyer's Guide",
        "content": "How important is an oil filter?\u00a0\n\nAn engine oil filter is made up of paper or fabric layers that oil passes through as it returns from its lubricating and cooling duties inside the engine. The oil is also used to keep the internal components clean, and any loose particles or contaminants are suspended in the oil. As it passes through the oil filter, the particles are captured by the pleated layers and, since oil flows only one way through the filter, they remain trapped there.\u00a0\u00a0\nVehicle oil filters keep collecting all the particulate matter until they\u2019re replaced. During an oil change, the filter is removed and discarded and a new filter is installed in its place. All of the matter it\u2019s collected is disposed of, never to have an opportunity to damage the engine.\u00a0\n\nHow long do oil filters really last?\u00a0\nIt might seem ridiculous to change the oil filter every oil change, even though intervals have extended to average 5,000 to 8,000 miles. But the damage that can result from improperly lubricated engine parts often costs thousands of dollars in parts and labor.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe problem with oil filters is that you can\u2019t see inside it. There\u2019s no way to accurately know how much junk it\u2019s collected while in use. Changing it is a preventative maintenance measure, and risking damage over an inexpensive part just isn\u2019t worth it. It\u2019s one of the cheapest insurances you can buy for your vehicle.\u00a0\n\nBest oil filters reviews for 2022\u00a0\n\nWhich car oil filters are the best-selling and highest-rated? Here are your top oil filters to keep your car running like a well-oiled machine.\u00a0\n\nSTP Extended Life Oil Filter\u00a0\n\nOne of the best oil filters for synthetic oil is the STP Extended Life Oil Filter. It might not look unique, but why should it when it\u2019s stuffed under the hood out of sight? But it\u2019s characteristics make it great for extended oil change intervals of up to 10,000 miles when full synthetic oil is used, and leaks are prevented with a silicone gasket that can withstand temperatures up to 400 F.\u00a0\n\nSTP Oil Filter\u00a0\n\nA high-quality yet inexpensive oil filter that keeps oil changes affordable is the STP oil filter. It can trap particles four times smaller than the naked eye can see with Advanced Micro Pore Technology Filter Media. With more than 100 part numbers, there\u2019s an STP oil filter for virtually every make and model.\u00a0\n\nSTP Oil Filter S2870A\n\nBuy Now \n\nACDelco Oil Filter\u00a0\n\nThe ACDelco oil filter might seem like it\u2019s just for GM models since it\u2019s their parts brand, but they offer oil filters for 98% of the models on the road. The filter media captures particles as small as 25 microns and the cartridge is designed to withstand burst pressures up to five times normal operating pressure.

        "title": "How to Tell if a Fuel Filter is Bad",
        "content": "What Does Your Fuel Filter Do?\n\nNo matter where it comes from, any gasoline that you pump in your car will likely contain natural impurities, deposits, and contaminants that settle in the fuel tank\u00a0and\u00a0could potentially cause damage to parts like the fuel injectors.\u00a0As you might guess, a fuel filter simply acts as a barrier, keeping potentially damaging elements from playing havoc on the rest of your vehicle.\u00a0Since it does undergo a lot of heavy use during the regular lifespan of your vehicle,\u00a0it slowly gathers and holds those contaminants, and eventually, if not attended to, will begin to restrict flow and eventually plug up.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow often to replace a fuel filter can depend on\u00a0a number of\u00a0things. Fuel filters on older cars will often last one and a half to two years, but some can last longer. Some newer cars have \u201clifetime\u201d filters that may be built into the fuel pump and do not need to be replace on a service interval. Check your owner\u2019s manual to determine exactly how long the usefulness of your fuel filter lasts. If you end up with a tank of dirty fuel or start to notice symptoms that indicate the fuel you\u2019re using is no longer being filtered properly, you may have to switch it out sooner than expected.\n\nHow Long Does a Fuel Filter Last?\u00a0\n\nSome but not all cars have a fuel filter element that can be replaced. On gas-powered cars, it\u2019s usually underneath, clipped or bolted to the frame rail. On diesel vehicles, it\u2019s usually in the engine compartment and has the same style as an oil filter. For most cases, the fuel filter needs to be replaced every 20,000 to 30,000 miles, while diesel vehicles often are slightly shorter intervals. The best way to tell your vehicle\u2019s interval is to check the maintenance guide provided along with your owner\u2019s manual.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome vehicles don\u2019t have a replaceable fuel filter. Rather, they have a screen on the fuel pump that filters out particles in the tank, and these filters aren\u2019t serviced unless you\u2019re working on the fuel pump itself.\u00a0\n\nSigns of a Bad Fuel Filter\u00a0\n\nAs fuel flows through the filter, pleated material strains out any contaminants on the way to the engine. It could be dirt, salt, or any moisture or debris that gets kicked into the massive tank when the gas station gets a delivery. When the fuel filter gets full of this material, it restricts fuel flow to the engine. Symptoms are sure to result eventually.\n\nPower loss when under loadCheck engine lights is onEngine runs rough or stallsYour engine won\u2019t startFuel pump quitsDecreased fuel economy\n\nPower Loss When Under Load\nRestricted fuel supply to the engine might allow for proper fuel pressure while the engine is idling. However, when you\u2019re accelerating or pulling a load, the demand for fuel is much greater. A blocked fuel filter prevents the fuel rail from staying full of fuel, restricting the amount of power your engine can produce.\n\nCheck Engine Light is On\u00a0\n\nIf the injectors don\u2019t receive enough pressurized fuel, there may not be enough sprayed into the cylinders to be burned. A \u2018P0171 System Too Lean\u2019 code could be stored in the powertrain control module, triggering the Check Engine Light.\n\nEngine Runs Rough or Stalls\n\nWithout sufficient fuel supply, the engine can stumble or stall while driving or while idling. Think of it like pinching the straw while you try to drink your soda through it. When you close off the straw, you\u2019re unable to keep the flow of energy-producing fluid going.\n\nYour Engine Won\u2019t Start\n\nWhen you turn the key, the fuel pump pressurizes fuel going into the supply line. A clogged fuel filter may prevent fuel from pressurizing the same in the section between the filter and the engine. Your engine may not fire up since it\u2019s starved of fuel, or it might fire up for a second and die again.\n\nFuel Pump Quits\n\nExcessive demand for fuel can create strain on the fuel pump. It\u2019s constantly cycling at peak performance, trying to force fuel into a restricted supply line. It can cause the fuel pump relay to kick off, the fuse to burn, or the fuel pump to quit altogether.\n\nDecreased Fuel Economy\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but a blocked fuel filter can actually cause higher fuel consumption. The PCM believes that the air-fuel mixture is lean and, to compensate, commands more fuel to mix with the air being sucked into the engine to get the amount of power you\u2019re commanding from your car. Though it\u2019s not performing as well, you\u2019re burning more fuel than if the fuel was moving at the right volume.\n\nHow Do You Replace a Fuel Filter?\n\nIf you see signs you need to change your fuel filter, then it\u2019s probably time to start thinking about whether you can replace it yourself or if you need some professional help. While the exact process for changing the filter can vary a lot depending on your vehicle, it is possible to switch it out yourself.\u00a0\nRemember, that you are going to be dealing with gasoline, and leaking gasoline once you crack open the fuel line, so exercise extreme caution! Be sure to read your repair manual or consult online how to properly relieve the fuel system of pressure before cracking open the fuel line, or what steps need to be taken to open the fuel system.\u00a0\nThe most common location for a fuel filter is in one of the fuel lines coming from the fuel tank, mounted near the tank on the\u00a0vehicle\u2019s frame. Several are also located inside the engine compartment,\u00a0while others are non-serviceable and located within the fuel pump assembly, in the fuel tank.\u00a0\nMost fuel systems on cars built in the last 20 years have quick-connect clips or unions that hold the lines\u00a0together, and\u00a0hold the fuel filter in-line for a leak-free seal. With the right tools,\u00a0such as OEM 25150 or 24681,\u00a0you can disconnect these fittings. Keep in mind, they can often be tricky to disconnect. If you do not have a lot of experience with fuel system maintenance, it may be best to get help from a professional mechanic, which you can search your area for one of our\u00a0Preferred Shops here.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeep in mind, a fuel filter is made to be a service-interval part, rather than a failure part. Follow your vehicle\u2019s OEM guidelines (check the owner\u2019s manual) on when to change a fuel filter, or, if you\u2019ve purchased a vehicle with over 100,000 miles and no indication the fuel filter has been changed, it\u2019s a great idea to change it.\u00a0The good news is that fuel filters can be a relatively affordable part, especially if you buy the parts and do the work yourself. A new filter can cost as little as around fifteen dollars in some cases, and even if you go to a pro, the costs of a replacement generally stays around $200.\nHow to Check a Fuel Filter\n\nOnce you remove a fuel filter, you can tell whether it\u2019s the source of your problem\u00a0by a simple blow-test.\u00a0\nFirst, attempt to drain all the gas out of the fuel filter the best you can.\u00a0Find the inlet to the fuel filter (should be labeled as either \u201cin\u201d or have an arrow pointing to the direction of the fuel flow) and clean that inlet with a shop towel. \nNow, place a disposable rag or shop towel\u00a0on your workbench, and gently blow into the inlet of the fuel filter, aiming down towards your shop rag on the bench. You should be able to easily blow into the filter without much resistance. With a plugged fuel filter, you won\u2019t be able to. With a heavily restricted or clogged fuel filter, it will be hard. \nRemember, gasoline is gross, doesn\u2019t taste good, and is flammable, so be sure to exercise extreme caution. Leave any rags or towels long enough to dry outside before disposing them, and NEVER throw any old fuel or rags wet with gasoline into the trash.\nKeeping Up with Fuel Filter Maintenance\nFuel filter problems generally\u00a0won\u2019t happen with proper maintenance.\u00a0If you start noticing problems with your engine running strangely and experience loss of power and poor gas mileage,\u00a0the fuel filter is a likely suspect\u00a0on the fuel side, and an easy one to check off and change.\u00a0\nLuckily, a\u202fnew fuel filter\u202fshould not cause too much of a dent in your bank account\u00a0and\u00a0even if you find that it doesn\u2019t solve the issue, you are still replacing a maintenance item that needs to be replaced soon enough.\u00a0Following the recommended change intervals in your owner\u2019s manual is key to maintain optimal vehicle health,\u00a0and in this case, the health of your fuel system. Waiting until you are starting to experience issues with your fuel filter may cause bigger fuel delivery issues to deal with beyond a\u00a0clogged filter.",

        "title": "What to Know About Your Car's Air Filters",
        "content": "1. What the Engine Air Filter Does\n\nThe internal combustion engine needs more than gasoline to start and take you where you need to go. It needs a continuous supply of air to mix with the gasoline to work properly. The challenge is that harmful contaminants in the air and materials such as dirt, grease, and other debris could damage your engine. Over time, these factors could eventually make your car unfit for the road or unable to run at all.\nWhen you consider what a car\u2019s air filter does, you\u2019ll understand the vital part it plays. The filter keeps these contaminants out of the intake manifold and cylinders, letting your engine run one clean air. As air moves through your car\u2019s air intake, contaminants are caught in the filter media, which is porous enough to allow air through, but not the contaminants. This can prevent severe engine damage, so you should never drive without an engine air filter. If you replace the filter regularly, your car is less likely to experience other problems.\n\n2. Replace it on Schedule\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to remember when it comes to car maintenance. Many parts of your vehicle will require attention and will need to be replaced or repaired at some point. As the air filter does its job, it will become dirty and filled with debris that it separates from the air that goes through the intake. This will restrict air flow and hurt the vehicle\u2019s performance. Before you get to this point, make sure you replace the filter. You can do this yourself if you have the time and skills. Or, you can find a competent mechanic to do it for you.\nWhen you should replace your engine air filter depends on what you drive. It\u2019s said that you should replace yours every 10,000 to 15,000 miles, but your owner\u2019s manual will have the precise service interval. Another good practice is once every 3 oil changes. There are also some lifetime air filters, which you regularly clean instead of replacing. Be aware that you\u2019ll more likely have a dirty air filter car if you often drive in heavy traffic, or live in a dusty, rural climate where you travel dirt or gravel roads. In this case, it\u2019s a good idea to replace the filter every 5,000 to 6,000 miles. Many car owners replace the filter at the same time and place as an oil change.\n\n3. Replace it When Gas Mileage Starts To Suffer\n\nIt is wise to keep a close eye on the efficiency of your vehicle. A car with good gas mileage will save you money in the long run. When gas prices are high, you may pay even more attention to your vehicle\u2019s gas mileage, particularly if you drive it a lot. Here\u2019s how the filter impacts the gas mileage:\n\nWhen the filter is dirty, airflow is restricted and less oxygen gets to the engine.\nThe engine makes up for this deficiency by using up more fuel.\nThis way, the car still gets the power it needs but requires you to fill up more frequently.\n\n4. Replace it if it Looks Filthy\n\nSometimes, knowing when to change the air filter is a simple matter of taking it out and examining it. A new air filter is generally white and clean. Gradually, as dirt and dust build up, it will turn gray or brown. This is normal and should not cause much concern. The darker it gets, the more likely you should replace it. By the time it\u2019s black and caked with debris and dirt, you should make the switch. If you\u2019re not sure, check your owner\u2019s manual for the proper service interval or talk to a mechanic. You\u2019re better off replacing it sooner than necessary than you are driving around with a clogged filter.\n\n5. What is the Cabin Air Filter?\n\nThe cabin air filter keeps the air inside the car clean and safe. It works similarly to an engine air filter in that the filter\u2019s media lets air pass through and stops dust, spores, and other unwanted materials. In this case, the car\u2019s heating and A/C system draws fresh air from outside the vehicle, in through the cabin air filter. You may wonder how often to change cabin air filter, and the good news is that you won\u2019t have to replace this as often as the engine air filter. Usually, changing it every 20,000 miles or annually should keep enough to keep air flowing nicely. To be sure, consult your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual.\nA common sign of a bad cabin air filter is a moldy or musty smell when you turn on your AC or heat. On most vehicles it can easily be removed from behind the glove box, and it should be pretty evident if the filter is dirty or not once you take a look. Replacing the cabin air filter is a fairly straightforward job that most people can do at home.

        "title": "How to Clean Your Car's Fuel Tank",
        "content": "Please remember to keep proper safety precautions in mind when you are working with fuel. Remember that gas is a highly combustible substance and thus extra care must be taken. For instance, make sure that your workspace is well-ventilated and you should have a fire extinguisher on hand. Additionally, make sure that nobody is working with flame near your work space or smoking cigarettes. Finally, make sure to adhere to all proper fuel disposing ordinances in your city. Do not dispose of gasoline by pouring it into open sewers, and make sure that any gasoline-soaked rags are not thrown into general waste bins.\n\nHow to Properly Clean a Gas Tank\n\n1. Drain\n\nDrain fuel tank into an approved container.\n\n2. Clean Outside of Tank\n\nClean rust and debris from the top of the fuel tank.\n\n3. Remove Fuel Pump\n\nRemove the fuel pump from the tank.\n\n4. Swirl\n\nSwirl gas tank, pour out remaining gas and debris.\n\n5. Clean Inside of Tank\n\nClean the tank interior with a low-suds soap and water mixture.\n\n6. Swirl Again\n\nSwirl cleaning solution inside the tank.\n\n7. Drain and Dry\n\nDrain tank and dry with compressed air and/or lint-free cloth.\n\n8. Inspect\n\nVisually inspect the tank and replace tank if damaged.\n\n9. Check if Dry\n\nConfirm tank is completely dry (approx. 30 min).\n\n10. Refill\n\nRefill tank with fresh fuel.\n\nEnsure fresh fuel is used with the new fuel pump. This prevents contaminations from going back into the clean tank.\nManually cleaning out your gas tank shouldn\u2019t take you more than an afternoon once you get some practice under your belt. And an afternoon invested in your car is certainly worth it.\n\nWhy Should I Clean My Fuel Tank?\n\nDid you know that most\u00a0replacement fuel pump\u00a0failures are due to contamination from the fuel tank? Contaminants in the tank cause the strainer to clog, forcing the pump to pull more current and amperage resulting in a burnout, damaging the new fuel pump that was just replaced. Depending upon the amount of contaminants it is estimated that It can take up to three fuel pumps to clean the tank. Sometimes a dirty fuel tank might not cause the pump to fail, but dirty fuel tanks can also affect your gas mileage and clog your fuel filter.\nThe original pump went into a clean tank. To ensure the same level of performance, the new pump should go into a clean tank too.\nTo make the job easier, we carry\u00a0Delphi Technologies\u2019 fuel tank cleaning kit (FFC01)\u00a0designed to help your customer easily clean their fuel tank. The kit includes a low-suds cleaning solution specifically designed to treat and rinse up to a 40 gallon tank. This solution removes microbial growth in the tank and breaks down the other contaminants that might be in the tank.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "What is a Cold Air Intake?",
        "content": "How Does a Cold Air Intake\u00a0Work?\n\nAs a combustion engine, your car or truck\u2019s engine uses what amounts to a controlled explosion to fire your pistons. Gas or diesel serves as the fuel while an ignition source (spark plug in a gas engine, compression itself in a diesel) provides combustion. Oxygen is present in the air that surrounds your vehicle, but the enclosed nature of your hood prevents it from easily getting into your combustion chambers. The air intake is simply ductwork that allows the engines vacuum to pull air into the engine to mix with fuel and be fired. How much air it can pull is what\u2019s the question.\nWhile the OE model air intake works fine, it has the same problems as most stock parts. It\u2019s cheaply made to keep costs low and it\u2019s not specifically geared toward performance. After all, motor vehicle manufacturers don\u2019t know if you\u2019re buying their machine to commute to work, haul cargo, or drive fast. Secondly, because consumers generally care about a quiet, noise free cabin, intakes are designed to be quiet, which, similar to exhaust, often makes them very restrictive.\nYour typical stock unit has two main issues preventing it from operating efficiently. First, it\u2019s design is not catered to flow the maximum amount of flow (or CFM) possible. Secondly, it\u2019s design is simply to provide a quiet, efficient passage of air to the engine that the driver in the cabin cannot hear. OEM intakes generally have a\u00a0filter box\u00a0and duct work that is restrictive. This means air has to travel through the box, through the mesh of the filter, and through the restrictive tube to get to your engine. This is only made worse by the low-flow air filters you find in most cars and trucks. Couple that with an intake that\u2019s too close to the engine, drawing hotter air, and you have decreased performance.\nA cold air intake moves the intake point farther away from the engine, so it sucks in cooler air. Some of them also include a high-temperature shield to further reduce the heat radiating from your internal parts. By removing the air box , reducing restriction in the ducting, and getting rid of the low-quality paper filter, you create an intake that can flow more air per minute to the engine.\nYour vehicle is now using colder and denser air to run your powerplant. The denser the air, the more oxygen gets to your engine. This makes it operate more efficiently, providing a host of performance benefits.\n\nWhat Are the\u00a0Advantages of a Cold Air Intake?\n\nDo cold air intakes work? The increased oxygen flow can net you between 5 and 20 horsepower depending on your engine and the product you buy. Higher quality intakes obviously work better, but they can\u2019t turn a 4-cylinder into a V8 power, so keep your expectations realistic.\nBeyond the horsepower increase, cold air intakes can also provide better throttle response and improved fuel economy. When your engine has the ability to get more air, it has the ability to create more power.\nAnother plus of an aftermarket air intake is saying goodbye to low-quality paper filters. Not only can you install a high-flow filter, it also means don\u2019t have to replace it every 15,000 miles. Many of the filters available for cold air intakes can be removed and washed to clean them. Just remember to do it as part of your regular maintenance: a dirty filter won\u2019t do its job.\nTo increase the benefits of your install, consider adding a few other mods to your machine. The air intake is only one side of the oxygen coin. Spent gases can choke off your engine, preventing the cold air from being as effective. A\u202fperformance exhaust system\u00a0removes more of these gases from your engine, allowing for better combustion. An ECU tuner can provide a better fuel/air mixture to get the most from these components. Combining all 3 together \u2013 air intake, exhaust, and an ECU tune is generally referred to as \u201cStage 1\u201d in the tuning and modification world \u2013 it\u2019s the first and most basic steps to getting increased performance.\nThat isn\u2019t to say you need either of these additions to gain the benefits of a cold air intake. You still have denser air providing more oxygen to your engine. These mods just add to the advantages of the component.\n\nDo Cold Air Intakes Cause\u00a0Problems?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to recommend cold air intakes, but every mod has its minuses. Newer vehicles often feature more complicated components. Manufacturers generally limit the mods you can install to limit liability. In the case of an aftermarket air intake, this means the part may void your warranty. Check your warranty to see if this is true for your car or truck.\nThe lack of a box increases the chances your intake could suck up some water. Small amounts can cause misfires, ruin spark plugs, and reduce performance. If a larger volume of water gets into the combustion chamber, it won\u2019t compress under the piston, causing severe engine damage. For driving in wet areas, you should install a bypass valve on your air intake to prevent water from getting into your engine.\nThe shape of the intake occasionally causes problems as well. The air is coming from a difference angle than it is on an OE model, which can throw off the idle of your engine. It can also send inaccurate readings to your sensors, throwing off the fuel/air mixture. This issue is fairly rare, however, and can often be fixed with some tuning.\nFinally, cold air intakes do not take into consideration, much like performance exhaust, that additional sound can be an issue. In most vehicles, you will immediately hear a sound with a cold air intake you didn\u2019t hear before \u2013 the sound of air sucking or flowing through the intake! On vehicles with a turbo, this sound is often much more pronounced. For some owners, this sound, much like a well tuned, throaty exhaust is desired. For others, it may be considered too much.",

        "title": "Car Tune-Up Checklist",
        "content": "What is a Tune-Up?\nThe term \u201ctune-up\u201d has drastically changed since the phrase was coined during the dawn of automobiles. For over 50 years, a tune-up meant that the vehicle\u2019s ignition system \u2013 breaker points and condenser, were replaced and/or adjusted, a new distributor cap, rotor, and spark plugs were installed, ignition timing was set, and the vehicles carburetor was adjusted and \u201ctuned\u201d (hence the term) for optimal performance. The process was as intricate as tuning a musical instrument \u2013 ignition and fueling had to work in perfect tune with each other for optimal performance, thus the term. \nWith vehicles of old, this was a regular occurrence. As electronic ignition replaced points-style systems, the need was still there for plugs, cap, rotor, and carb adjustments, but ultimately, even that became extinct once DIS (distributorless) ignition systems and computer-based fuel injection became the norm. Today, the vehicle\u2019s engine computer and engine components constantly keep these systems running right where they should. \nToday, at its simplest, a tune-up is a bit of a misnomer \u2013 simply a carry-over word of old to describe any time a host of basic routine maintenance is performed on your vehicle. Regular tune-ups can extend the life of a vehicle and help ensure it is operating at its full performance potential. Typically, when to do a tune-up is included in the regular maintenance section of owner\u2019s manuals.\nTuning-up your car today can mean a lot of things. It\u2019s a good idea to check the car\u2019s filters, belts, hoses, and fluids. Also, it\u2019s a good idea if you don\u2019t know the last time you replaced your spark plugs and/or wires/coil boots, now could be a good time. Many may not need to be replaced, but it will give you a chance to stop small issues that could develop into big problems if left unchecked. If you want to learn how to do some of the repairs listed below, consult one of our How-To articles. If you need more detailed vehicle-specific information, check out our Repair Help guides and diagrams.\nCheck out the list below to find the parts and systems that you should check in a tune-up. You don\u2019t need to do all of these things every time, but it\u2019s always a good idea to make sure these are working correctly.\n\nWhat Does a Tune-Up Consist of?\n\n1. Replace Plugs, Wires, and Other Ignition Parts\n\nThe ignition system consists of\u202fspark plugs, plug wires, coils, and other electrical components that ignite the air/fuel mixture in your combustion chamber. The system has changed drastically over the years, where newer ignition systems require only spark plugs and wires/coil boots to be changed at a certain mileage. Older vehicles, as stated before, can have a distributor cap and rotor, and even older, can have breaker points.\nSpark Plugs\n\nSpark plugs have a metal tip (electrode) that wears down over time from high heat and constant electrical arc.\nA symptom of worn spark plugs is a misfire, when the fuel/air mixture in a cylinder fails to ignite.\nWhen replacing spark plugs, it is highly recommended to use plugs of the original equipment (OE) recommended metal. Consult your owner\u2019s manual, repair manual or the experts at AutoZone to learn which is the recommended spark plug metal is right for you or check out our other blogs on spark plugs.\nBe sure to use a light application of anti-seize on the threads of the plugs prior to installation (avoid getting anti-seize anywhere else but the threads).\n\nIn DIS (distributorless) applications that use one coil for multiple plugs, be sure to use either Double Platinum or Iridium plugs as recommended by the manufacturer.\nIf you need some help on replacing yours, check out our guide on\u202fhow to change spark plugs.\nIgnition Wires\n\nIgnition wires will break down over time and eventually fail.\nSymptoms of a failed wire are rough idle, misfire, performance loss, and eventually a dead cylinder.\nWhen replacing a distributor cap or ignition wires, transfer one wire at a time from the old cap to the new cap. This prevents the ignition system from becoming cross wired, which result in a rough running engine. You can make this job easier by using a spark plug boot tool.\nUse dielectric grease in the boots to help prevent arcing and help make future boot removal easier.\nBe sure that your wires are secure and routed away from exhaust components.\n\nIgnition Coils\n\nCoils transform low battery voltage into thousands of volts. Over time this high voltage electricity wears out the coils out.\nSigns your coils may be worn out include engine misfires, weakened acceleration, rough idle, and reduced gas mileage.\nSome vehicles use coil packs, which are typically located near the valve covers, while others use a coil-on-plug design that are over or close to the spark plugs.\nPut dielectric grease on the boot of coil-on-plug coils.\n\nDistributor Cap and Rotor and Breaker Points (If Applicable)\n\nNumerous rotations of the rotor inside the distributor will cause the metal contact point to wear down.\nA failed distributor cap causes misfires or in more severe cases a non-start.\nWhen performing a tune-up it is suggested to replace both the cap and rotor at the same time.\nTransfer ignition wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap. This prevents the ignition system from becoming cross wired, which result in a rough running engine. You can make this job easier by using a spark plug boot tool.\nOlder vehicles pre-1974 usually contain breaker-points which need to be adjusted / replaced on a regular basis.\n\n2. Let Your Engine Run Clean with New Filters\n\nFilters in your vehicle consist of: oil, fuel, air, and cabin air filters. Filters keep contaminating particles from reaching vital components in your engine and related systems. Having a clean filter improves engine performance and efficiency. Dirty filters make your vehicle work harder to get the air, fuel, and oil that it needs. This can choke off your engine or decrease the ability to deliver air, oil or fuel at the proper pressure.\nEngine Air Filter\n\nFilters thousands of gallons of air for every gallon of fuel and will clog over time.\nClogged air filters can reduce performance, but not MPGs on fuel injected engines*.\nClogged air filters in carbureted engines can reduce MPG\u2019s by 2-6% and up to 14%*. \nReplacing your\u202fair filter is generally a simple task, check out our\u202fair filter replacement guide\u202fif you need help.\n\n*Based on a testing claim from\u202ffueleconomy.gov\nCabin Air Filter\n\nSome vehicles are equipped with a cabin air filtration system and thus have a replaceable filter element to keep the air inside the vehicle clean.\nA dirty cabin air filter can allow dust, pollen, exhaust fumes and other contaminants into your vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and restrict airflow into the vehicle.\nMost cabin air filters are easily accessible and take less than 15 minutes to change. Learn how from this\u202fcabin air filter guide.\n\nOil Filter\n\nDirty oil can lead to excessive wear on internal engine components.\nAn oil filter is used to filter vital engine oil of contamination and can clog if not replaced at recommended intervals.\nCan lead to high oil pressure in severe circumstances of clogging.\nShould be replaced with every\u202foil change at recommended intervals. Learn more from\u202foil change guide.\n\nFuel Filter\n\nDirty fuel and contaminated fuel tanks can clog your fuel filter and lead to low fuel pressure, sometimes resulting in hesitation while accelerating or rough idling.\nCan lead to premature fuel pump failure in severe circumstances.\nShould be replaced with every\u202foil change at recommended intervals.\n\nPCV Valve\n\nOver time the Positive Crankcase Ventilation Valve can become clogged by carbon build up.\nFailure can cause the engine to consume oil at a much faster rate, cause poor fueling conditions, misfires, and actually blow out gaskets due to pressure accumulating in the crankcase.\nThe PCV Valve is usually easy to replace. In many cases, it can be swapped out in a matter of a few minutes.\n\n3. Keep Your Auxiliary Systems in Check with New Belts and Hoses\n\nBelts connect the pulleys of your accessory drive system which transfer the rotating force of the crankshaft pulley to the\u202falternator, water\u202fpump, power steering pump, and other systems. Hoses transfer vital fluids throughout the engine. Over time, belts and hoses wear down due to the elements they are exposed to such as heat and cold as well as the constant use they see with day to day operation of the vehicle. They eventually wear down, glaze over, turn brittle, crack and even break.\nSerpentine Belt\n\nThe serpentine belt rides in a series of pulleys on the front of your engine.\nThe belt wears down, and needs replacement because of exposure to heat and stress.\nInspect the belt(s) for cracks, fraying, glazing or fluid contamination. Any of these conditions can cause the belt to slip or break.\nIf you need help changing the belt out, check our\u202fserpentine belt replacement guide.\n\nBelt Tensioner\n\nThe belt tensioner maintains the correct belt tension.\nA weak belt tensioner will cause premature belt wear.\nA \u2018tight or sticking\u2019 belt tensioner will cause premature wear to the water pump and other accessory bearings.\nWith the belt off, rotate the tensioner through its arc of travel. It should move smoothly and provide firm tension.\nWhile the belt is off check the idler and tensioner pulley, plus accessory pulleys for proper alignment and smooth rotation \u2013 if any roughness or noise is detected in any pulley \u2013 replace it at this time.\n\nTiming Belt\n\nThe timing belt controls the internal mechanical timing on many engines. This belt usually has an 80,000 \u2013 100,000 mile life cycle, and then must be replaced, along with any tensioner or idler components that run the belt.\nWhen a timing belt breaks on most vehicles, the piston can and will come in contact with valves that are stuck open which causes catastrophic damage.\nThe timing belt is an intricate job, and should be replaced on the recommended mileage intervals.\nWhen inspecting your timing belt, take the time to check the cam and crank seals for leaks.\nSome vehicles feature a\u202ftiming chain\u202finstead of a timing belt. Timing chains typically do not need to be replaced as often, and usually have a much longer life cycle, although tensioner components which keep the chain tight can fail.\n\nHoses\n\nRadiator hoses and heater hoses circulate coolant through the engine and the radiator to expel the heat absorbed.\nMost hoses are made of rubber and will break down over time. You can find out of it is time to replace your hoses by inspecting them for swelling, bulging, or leaks. When the engine is cool, squeeze the hoses to feel for hard spots and soft spots.\nCheck the hose clamps for damage or loss of tension too. You don\u2019t want one to let go while your engine\u2019s hot.\nIf a hose were to fail, the engine could overheat. Overheating can cause serious, sometimes irreparable damage to the engine.\n\n4. Maintain Your Car with the Right Fluids\n\nEngine oil, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid are necessary for your vehicle to operate properly. Contaminated fluids can lead to excessive wear on internal components. You can save money in the long run by servicing these fluids before expensive damage occurs. Regular change intervals exist for each type of fluid and as such, they need to be replaced at recommended service intervals, find out more by consulting your owner\u2019s manual or by visiting Repair Help.\nMotor Oil\n\nAs oil circulates through your engine and is exposed to heat and pressure, the oil will become contaminated.\nAn oil filter will keep large particles from being recirculated, but will not keep the oil from providing a protective barrier of lubrication.\nReplace the oil filter during an oil change.\nOil should be replaced at manufacturer recommended mileage or time intervals, consult your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nCoolant\n\nYour cooling system keeps your engine from overheating in the summer and prevents your engine from freezing in the winter.\nCoolant will eventually break down and become contaminated which results in degraded flow and the fluid\u2019s ability to fight corrosion.\nFlushing your cooling system with a flush product specifically designed to remove deposits regularly will improve the performance of your cooling system.\nAlways refer to your owner\u2019s manual to determine the recommended coolant for your vehicle. Different manufacturers require the use of different types of coolant and using a fluid other than what\u2019s specified by the manufacturer can result in engine damage.\nBe sure to mix the coolant with the correct amount of water or use a pre-mixed product that\u2019s ready to pour in.\nShould you decide to change your coolant, check out our\u202fcoolant flush and fill guide.\n\nBrake Fluid\n\nBrake fluid is a vital fluid in your vehicle, without it you would not be able to stop.\nDOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid are hygroscopic, which means the fluid will absorb moisture from the air. This added moisture lowers the fluids ability to operate efficiently as a hydraulic fluid and causes internal corrosion in the braking system.\nDark or muddy looking fluid is a sure sign of hygroscopic contamination.\nIt is recommended that the brake fluid be changed out for fresh fluid and the brake system bled to ensure that new clean fluid is flowing throughout the entire system.\n2 years is the recommended changing interval. Learn how to do it yourself with our\u202fguide on how to bleed brakes.\n\nAutomatic Transmission Fluid (ATF)\n\nAutomatic transmissions use friction packs, along with gearing to operate, which in turn needs a fluid to regulate that friction. This creates a ton of heat and results in wear of internal components and contamination of transmission fluid. This wear and tear makes it imperative to follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for transmission fluid and filter change.\nBrown transmission fluid is an indication that the fluid needs to be changed but, if the fluid is muddy or smells very burnt, do NOT change, instead, take your vehicle to a professional for a professional diagnosis and opinion on how to proceed.\nBe sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual for recommended change intervals as well as the correct fluid type to be used.\n\nPower Steering Fluid\n\nOver time contamination can cause wear to the power steering pump.\nBe sure that your power steering fluid does not appear muddy and is between the MAX and MIN levels in the reservoir.\nBe sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual for recommended change intervals as well as the correct fluid type to be used.\n\nYou can get great benefits from performing a tune-up on your vehicle. It\u2019s one of the best ways to maintain original performance. In fact, fixing a car that is badly out of tune can give a noticeable boost to both engine performance and fuel economy*. A vehicle running in top shape today prevents and lessens costly repairs tomorrow. AutoZone\u2019s tune-up guide will show you the common parts that are replaced when tuning up a vehicle such as spark plugs, plug wires, air filter and fuel filter. It\u2019s also a great time to check other components under the hood such as belts, hoses, and fluids.\nConsider purchasing a repair manual or\u202fregister on AutoZone.com to view free repair guides\u202fthat give information on how to replace these parts as they relate to your vehicle\u2019s specific needs.\n*In vehicles with major emissions issues or carbureted vehicles.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "How Do Oil Filters Work?",
        "content": "Introduction to Oil filters\n\nEngine oil contains detergent. High-quality oil contains better detergent, and more of it. That cleaning agent helps to prevent pollutants from sticking to internal engine parts. Instead, those harmful materials are held in suspension within the engine oil, where they are delivered, under high pressure and flow rate, to the oil filter.\nAs the name implies, an oil filter strains and filters particles out of the engine oil. Why is that necessary? Because the inside of an engine is a dirty place. As fuel burns, it produces many harmful byproducts. Those are things like ash, carbon, chemical toxins, moisture, and worst of all, sludge. Sludge is that gooey, thick, messy substance you might see accumulating under the oil fill cap. If you left all those pollutants to circulate freely with the engine oil, they would soon destroy expensive internal engine parts.\nOil filters capture the harmful particles in folds or pleats so they can be disposed of when you change the oil. That way, there\u2019s no chance that these abrasive, sludgy bits will find their way into your engine again, contaminating new oil.\n\nHow Oil Filters Work\n\nThe filter has a membrane material that traps and holds those foreign substances. High-quality oil filters have a finer membrane, and more of it, to do a better job of filtering under adverse conditions, like in extreme heat or cold, stop and go driving, or frequent short trips. Why are frequent short trips so bad?\nBecause a cold engine produces more harmful by-products of combustion than a hot engine does. Also, it doesn\u2019t get hot enough, and doesn\u2019t stay hot long enough to burn off some of those pollutants. That means more work for the oil filter.\nEither way, the filter can\u2019t hold an infinite amount of toxins. That\u2019s why we replace the oil filter with every oil change. It\u2019s a little amount to spend to protect the very expensive engine.\n\nTypes of Engine Oil Filters\n\nWhen it boils down to it, there are two main types of oil filters that you\u2019ll come across:\n\nA canister-style filter looks similar to a soup can that threads onto an adapter that feeds engine oil through it. The filter media or membrane is contained inside it, making it simple to unscrew and toss out when the time comes. They\u2019re normally found on the bottom of the engine block or on the side halfway down. It\u2019s the most common type, especially on older vehicles.\nA cartridge-style, or a drop-in oil filter, is in a housing under the hood with a cap on it. The filter media tends to have a much larger surface area than canister-style filters, and it\u2019s easy to inspect for debris and sludge when you\u2019re changing the oil.\n\nRegardless of which type your car uses, you can minimize engine maintenance and repairs by using high-efficiency oil filters. Look for oil filters that report the ability to trap virtually all particles that are 20 microns in size or larger, since it\u2019s these bits that are most harmful to your engine. That\u2019s not to say other oil filters can\u2019t do the job, but for a few extra dollars a couple of times per year, is it worth the risk?\n\nChoosing the Right Oil Filter\n\nChoosing the right oil filter is crucial for ensuring your engine performance remains at the top of its game and lasts a long time. When selecting an oil filter, consider factors such as:\n\nFiltration efficiency, as mentioned. Look for filters that strain the most contaminants.\nCompatibility with your vehicle\u2019s make and model. Other sizes and styles simply won\u2019t work properly. For example, a canister filter that\u2019s too wide won\u2019t seal against the engine well.\nThe type of oil you\u2019re using. Some filters are intended for use with synthetic oil, for example.\nYour mileage. For models with higher mileage, some options provide better protection against wear-causing contaminants.\n\nOEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) filters are specifically designed for your vehicle, offering a seamless fit and meeting manufacturer specifications. However, many aftermarket filters provide cost-effective alternatives with the same or better performance. Just ensure they meet or exceed OEM standards.\nUnderstanding oil filter specifications is key to making an informed choice. Look for features like:\n\nAn anti-drain back valve that prevents oil from draining out of the filter when the engine is turned off. It ensures that the engine receives oil quickly upon startup, reducing wear and tear.\nA by-pass valve that allows oil to flow around the filter if it becomes clogged, ensuring a continuous supply of oil to the engine in case the filter reaches its capacity.\nFilter media such as synthetic or cellulose filter media. Synthetic media often provides better filtration and durability, especially in extreme conditions.\nThread size and O-ring specifications that match your vehicle\u2019s specifications, including the correct thread size and O-ring dimensions, is crucial for a proper fit.\n\nWhen to Replace Oil Filters\n\nChange your oil filter as part of routine maintenance. The life and longevity of your engine depends greatly on its oil filter. Ignore it, leave it on too long, and you could be facing some very expensive repair bills.\nOil filter replacement varies a great deal between different models, but it\u2019s easiest to track when you do it every time you change the engine oil. Many older vehicles have a three-month or 3,000-mile interval for oil changes, whereas newer cars can be a set interval such as 5,000 miles or at least two times per year, or according to an oil life monitoring system that can sometimes be as high as 15,000 miles.\nThe best way to determine when to change an oil filter is based on your specific vehicle\u2019s oil change requirements in the service schedule. In addition, if you inspect the oil and it\u2019s milky, dark brown or black, or has metallic speckles in it, change the oil immediately.\nIf you fancy yourself a DIYer, changing your own oil filter isn\u2019t difficult, and it only requires a few tools like a drain pan for the old oil and an oil filter wrench. Remove the oil filter after the oil has been drained to prevent a massive mess. Or, if you don\u2019t have the time to deal with your own maintenance, you can always bring your engine oil and a new filter to a professional to change it.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Introduction to Fluid Leak Identification\n\nFluid leaks can be an early indicator of potential automotive issues, and detecting them promptly is crucial for maintaining your vehicle\u2019s health and safety. Each system tends to have a different color of fluid used, and it makes choices for compatibility as well as leak identification easier.\nEarly detection of fluid leaks is like catching a medical condition in its initial stages \u2013 it allows for timely intervention, preventing further damage and costly repairs. Regularly inspecting your vehicle for leaks is a proactive measure that contributes to both your safety and the longevity of your automobile.\n\nOverview of Common Vehicle Fluids\n\nUnderstanding the different fluids circulating through your vehicle is the first step in leak identification. Common fluids include brake fluid, transmission fluid, engine oil, power steering fluid driveline fluids, and coolant, each serving a vital function in the overall performance of your vehicle.\n\nBrake Fluid Leaks\n\nBrake fluid is typically clear or slightly yellow when new. However, as it ages, it darkens. Identifying brake fluid leaks is often associated with a distinct light brown to dark brown color. If you notice such a color beneath your vehicle, it\u2019s time to investigate further.\nBrake fluid leaks can stem from damaged brake lines, corroded fittings, or a faulty master cylinder. The safety implications are significant as a compromised brake system can lead to reduced braking performance, affecting your ability to stop the vehicle safely. Address brake fluid leaks immediately to ensure optimal brake performance and overall safety.\n\nTransmission Fluid\n\nHave you seen a pinkish fluid leaking from your car? It could be automatic transmission fluid, and of course, one location it\u2019s used is in an automatic transmission. It can vary in color, but it generally falls within the range of red to brown. Fresh transmission fluid is bright red, while older fluid tends to darken. A noticeable deviation from these colors may indicate a transmission fluid leak.\nTransmission fluid leaks may point to problems with the transmission seals, gaskets, or a faulty transmission pan gasket. Ignoring these leaks can lead to costly transmission repairs. Signs of transmission issues include slipping gears, delayed or rough shifting, and unusual noises. If you suspect a transmission fluid leak, you need to check it and fix it right away to prevent further damage.\n\nPower Steering Fluid\nThe power steering system is hydraulic-based on most vehicles, and it contains fluid that\u2019s pushed throughout the system to perform steering assist functions. If you\u2019ve seen red fluid leaking from your car, it\u2019s possible that it could also be power steering fluid as some vehicles use ATF. Other than reddish fluid, the power steering fluid color tends to be almost clear and, as it ages, it gets a light to dark brown color.\u00a0\nCommon issues are leaking power steering cooler hoses, a leaking power steering cooler, worn-out steering pump, and worn steering gear seals. If power steering fluid leaks go unrepaired, it causes undue stress and wear on the steering components and you could have a rack and pinion failure or a pump issue.\n\nEngine Oil Leaks\n\nEngine oil leaks can manifest in various colors, each indicative of different issues. Fresh engine oil is amber, but it darkens over time. If you observe a light brown, black, or even a transluscent greenish color beneath your vehicle, it\u2019s time to investigate for potential engine oil leaks.\nCommon causes include a loose drain plug or oil filter, leaking gaskets including the oil pan gasket, valve cover gaskets, and crankshaft seals, or even a cracked block in rare instances. Engine oil leaks can lead to reduced lubrication, causing increased friction and heat in the engine components. This can result in decreased engine performance, reduced fuel efficiency, and, if left unaddressed, severe engine damage. Regularly checking for and addressing oil leaks is crucial for maintaining the health and longevity of your vehicle\u2019s engine.\n\nCoolant Leaks\n\nHave you seen green fluid leaking from your car? Coolant, or antifreeze, is usually bright green, orange, pink, or blue. A visible puddle of one of these colors beneath your vehicle could indicate a coolant leak. Identifying the specific color can help determine the type of coolant and potential issues.\nCoolant leaks can result from a damaged radiator, hoses, or a failing water pump. To prevent coolant leaks, ensure that your vehicle\u2019s cooling system is regularly inspected and maintained.

        "title": "When to Change Transmission Fluid",
        "content": "Understanding Transmission Fluid Lifespan\n\nAutomatic transmission fluid, or ATF, is a lubricant that serves a bunch of purposes in a transmission and, as such, is a blend of base oils and various additives. They include:\n\nBase oils \u2013 They provide lubrication and help dissipate heat generated within the transmission. Mineral oil, synthetic oil, or a blend of both can be used as base oils.\nDetergents \u2013 These help keep the transmission clean by preventing sludge and other deposits from forming.\nFriction modifiers \u2013 These additives help the clutch plate to grip better.\nAnti-wear agents \u2013 These additives help reduce wear and tear as a protective layer between moving parts.\nCorrosion inhibitors \u2013 These are for protecting against corrosion if exposed to moisture or oxygen.\u00a0\nSeal swell agents \u2013 They help seals stay in good shape to prevent leaks.\nAnti-foaming agents \u2013 To prevent aeration in the transmission fluid that can reduce effectiveness, these additives are included.\n\nAlong with these additives, color is also added to help identify leaks and so you can differentiate ATF from other fluids in the vehicle. Typically, the ATF is a reddish or pinkish color while CVT fluid is a light green color in many cases.\nJust like with engine oil, transmission fluid breaks down the more it is used. Even if it\u2019s barely used, the fluid oxidizes in the vehicle and can absorb moisture, which is why there\u2019s almost always a replacement spec for both time and mileage.\nOther factors that influence fluid degradation include high operating temperatures, stop-and-go-driving, towing and hauling heavy loads, and contaminants like dirt and water that find their way into the fluid.\n\nSigns Your Transmission Fluid Needs Changing\n\nIn time, your transmission fluid will need to be changed or you risk excessive wear that affects performance or even a complete failure. Signs that your transmission fluid needs attention will vary, but they can include:\n\nColor changes \u2013 When it\u2019s aging, the bright coloration in ATF changes to a brownish hue. It can turn a blackish color when the fluid is badly in need of a change.\nIt smells bad \u2013 Although transmission fluid has a peculiar odor when it\u2019s new, there\u2019s a very distinct and strong burnt smell that comes out when it\u2019s old and due for replacement. This is because it\u2019s lost some of its protective qualities and has been scorched.\n\nUnusual transmission behavior \u2013 This can manifest in many ways. You could experience shift flares, delayed shifts, and whining or grinding can occur. It\u2019s usually worse when the vehicle is warmed up.\nYour maintenance system says so \u2013 For some newer cars, your vehicle maintenance will be indicated on the dash when it\u2019s due.\n\nIf any of these symptoms show up, don\u2019t put off your transmission fluid change any longer.\n\nRecommended Transmission Fluid Change Intervals\n\nAll vehicles come with a routine maintenance service schedule when they\u2019re new. If you don\u2019t have it or you bought your vehicle used, you can find the guide on the manufacturer\u2019s website. In there, you\u2019ll find the interval for how often to change transmission fluid.\nTypically, there are two different specs found in the manual: normal service and severe service. You might think you\u2019re in the normal service section, but the fact is that drivers in any climates with major seasonal temperature swings should follow the severe service schedule, as should those who have high-performance models or tow and haul regularly. If you\u2019re ever in doubt, it\u2019s safest to follow the severe schedule.\nThe typical guidelines for transmission fluid changes are:\n\nEvery 30,000 miles for passenger cars, crossovers, and minivans under severe service.\nEvery 60,000 miles for cars, vans, and crossovers under normal service.\nFor trucks and SUVs, it\u2019s also every 60,000 miles under normal service.\nFor severe service for trucks and SUVs, reduce the interval to 20,000 to 25,000 miles.\n\nRegardless of mileage, change the transmission fluid every five years or whenever symptoms show up that indicate it\u2019s necessary, even if it\u2019s well before the mileage is up.\n\nDIY vs. Professional Transmission Fluid Change\n\nFor DIYers, there\u2019s pride in doing your own maintenance, including transmission fluid changes. But there\u2019s even more to it. You\u2019re saving money on labor, adding to your automotive knowledge and skills, avoiding the need for frustrating appointments, and you can control the quality of materials going into your car.\nHowever, you do need a certain amount of knowledge to do the job well, or the research skills to find it. Also, you may not have all the equipment necessary in your garage, and there\u2019s a chance you could choose the wrong fluid. Also, it might have implications on your warranty if it\u2019s done incorrectly, plus you\u2019ll need a way to prevent mess and dispose of old fluid.\nIf you pay a professional to get it done, there are labor costs involved, but there are also benefits. You get peace of mind that the job is done right, it can save you time, and they\u2019ll take care of fluid disposal too. And, in most shops, you\u2019ll also receive a vehicle inspection to let you know of any other issues.\n\nConsequences of Neglecting Transmission Fluid Changes\n\nThinking about skipping out on transmission fluid maintenance? That\u2019s not a great plan. You risk performance issues with your transmission including trouble accelerating, rough shifting, and even a decrease in fuel efficiency. Dirt and sludge can build up inside, potentially starving parts of needed lubrication and contributing to premature failures.\nPlus there\u2019s the looming cost of a transmission repair or replacement. Proactive maintenance can help you avoid a repair bill that can easily stretch into the thousands, and that doesn\u2019t include labor.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Understanding Transmission Fluid\n\nTransmission fluid is responsible for the smooth operation of gears and overall transmission performance. Composed of a blend of base oils and additives, its primary purpose is as a hydraulic fluid to perform functions inside the system. As well, the fluid is used to lubricate the transmission components, reduce friction, and dissipate heat generated during operation. The additives in transmission fluid, particularly detergents and friction modifiers, also help in cleaning and protecting internal components from wear and tear. Typically, a red dye is added to distinguish it from other fluids.\nHowever, each manufacturer sets their own standards for transmission fluid, and composition varies. It\u2019s crucial to use the right option, whether it\u2019s ATF+4, Dexron V, Mercon V, or a different spec, to ensure your transmission lasts.\nRecognizing signs of transmission fluid problems is vital for maintaining your vehicle\u2019s health. Keep an eye out for symptoms such as slipping gears, delayed or rough shifting, or unusual noises during gear changes. Additionally, if you notice a burnt smell or a discolored transmission fluid, it might be an indication of overheating or contamination that needs immediate attention.\n\nDecoding Power Steering Fluid\n\nPower steering fluid plays a pivotal role in the power steering system, enhancing the driver\u2019s ability to turn the steering wheel. It works by transmitting hydraulic pressure to assist in steering, reducing the effort required, especially at lower speeds. Power steering fluid is typically composed of a mix of base oils and additives designed to provide smooth, consistent power assistance. When it\u2019s new, it\u2019s usually clear or light brown. Some systems use red fluid that\u2019s either very similar to ATF, or an ATF is used, so it could also be red.\nIssues with power steering fluid can manifest in various ways such as:\n\nUnusual noises when turning the steering wheel\nDifficulty steering the car at low speeds\nA steering wheel that feels unusually stiff\u00a0\u00a0\nWhining or droning noises that get worse while turning\nVibration or chattering in the steering wheel\nVisibly dark, milky, or gritty fluid in the reservoir\n\nRegular checks are essential to catch potential issues early and prevent more severe damage to the power steering system.\n\nKey Differences Between Transmission and Power Steering Fluid\n\nWhile both transmission and power steering fluids serve as hydraulic fluids, they have distinct compositions tailored to their specific functions. Transmission fluid often contains friction modifiers and detergents, optimizing it for the demands of the transmission system. In contrast, power steering fluid focuses on maintaining proper viscosity and lubrication for the power steering pump and hydraulic system.\nTransmission fluid tends to have a pour point of around -60 F whereas power steering fluid is around -36 F, so transmission fluid will pour more readily in extreme cold.\nOn the other side, power steering fluid has a higher flash point, often between 500 and 600 F, and transmission fluid is around 400 F. That means power steering fluid can withstand high heat without breaking down or boiling bette than ATF.\nOne common question is, \u201cIs power steering fluid the same as transmission fluid?\u201d The answer is no, they are formulated differently. It\u2019s crucial to use the right fluid for each system to ensure optimal performance and prevent damage. Using transmission fluid in the power steering system or vice versa can lead to compromised functionality and potential damage if the manufacturer does not recommend it.\nAgain, in some cold climates and for certain carmakers, ATF is the chosen fluid for power steering systems, particularly where temperatures plummet to -40 F, reducing instances of blown power steering pressure hoses and other failures.\n\nFluid Maintenance Tips for Optimal Performance\n\nAs with all fluids, both transmission fluid and power steering fluid should be checked and replaced periodically.\n\nTransmission fluid and power steering fluid should both be checked during every oil change, at least, and more frequent inspections certainly don\u2019t hurt.\nChange the transmission fluid every 30,000 to 60,000 miles for most vehicles, although the spec in your maintenance schedule should be followed.\nReplace your power steering fluid every two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first.\n\nChoosing the Right Fluid for Your Vehicle\n\nWhether for top-ups or flushing your fluids, choosing the right spec is crucial, and there can be several options. You\u2019ll find the correct spec in your maintenance guide, and for transmission fluid options can include:\n\nDexron \u2013 for General Motors products and other compatible makes\nMercon \u2013 for Ford products and select other brands\nATF+4 \u2013 for Stellantis brands\nCVT \u2013 for models with a continuously variable transmission\nMulti-Vehicle ATF \u2013 often compatible with most automatic transmissions\nImport ATF \u2013 for Honda Nissan, Toyota, and other import brands\n\nAlways check that the container specifies that the fluid meets the standards your vehicle requires, as indicated in your owner\u2019s manual.\nUsing the wrong trans fluid can result in premature wear inside the transmission or harsh shifting, plus it may deteriorate the fluid early. And it\u2019s never okay to use power steering fluid inside the transmission. Conversely, some vehicles can use ATF as their power steering fluid, but make sure it\u2019s approved by the manufacturer prior to doing so or it could cause wear to components like the rack and pinion internally.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

It can withstand higher temperatures, higher pressure, and it contains additives geared toward enhancing friction with clutches.\nEngine oil, meanwhile, caters to the entire engine, providing lubrication, cooling, cleaning, and sealing. It\u2019s intended to coat parts well, all the while making them as slippery as possible to prevent wear.\n\nOverlapping Functions in Vehicle Lubrication\n\nDespite their distinct roles, transmission fluid and engine oil share some common ground. Both lubricants contribute to reducing friction except where transmission fluid promotes clutch grip, preventing wear on vital components, and dissipating heat. The overlap in their functions highlights the interconnected nature of these lubricants in maintaining overall vehicle health.\n\nMaintenance Tips for Optimal Performance\n\nRegular maintenance is key to ensuring the longevity and efficiency of your vehicle\u2019s transmission. It\u2019s generally recommended to change transmission fluid every 30,000 to 60,000 miles, but always consult your vehicle\u2019s manual for specific recommendations. The process involves draining the old fluid, replacing the filter where applicable, and refilling with fresh, manufacturer-approved transmission fluid.\nRoutine oil changes are essential for preserving your engine\u2019s health. Conventional oil should typically be changed every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, while synthetic oil can extend that interval to 7,500 to 10,000 miles. The procedure involves draining the old oil, replacing the oil filter, and filling the engine with the appropriate oil grade and quantity as specified by the vehicle manufacturer.\nUnderstanding the distinctions between transmission fluid and engine oil is vital for every vehicle owner, and they should never cross-contaminate systems. By grasping their unique properties, functions, and maintenance requirements, you empower yourself to make informed decisions that contribute to the longevity and optimal performance of your vehicle.

        "title": "Automatic vs. Manual Transmission Fluid",
        "content": "Introduction to Transmission Fluids\n\nTransmission fluid is a specialized lubricant that plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of your vehicle\u2019s transmission system. It serves multiple purposes, such as lubrication, cooling, and maintaining hydraulic pressure within the transmission. Essentially, it keeps the gears and moving parts in your transmission running smoothly.\nIt\u2019s the lifeblood of your transmission system. It reduces friction and wear on components, ensuring your transmission functions optimally. It contains friction modifiers, detergents, corrosion inhibitors, and other additives to promote healthy operation in the gearcase. In addition, it prevents overheating by dissipating heat generated during operation. The right transmission fluid is essential for your vehicle\u2019s longevity, smooth gear changes, and overall performance.\n\nAutomatic Transmission Fluid (ATF)\n\nATF is specially formulated for automatic transmissions, which operate with a hydraulic torque converter. This fluid is thinner and more consistent in composition compared to MTF. ATF contains additives that protect and enhance the performance of automatic transmissions, and its primary purpose is for hydraulic operations, although it also lubricates well.\nThere are different types of ATF, with the most common ones being Dexron and Mercon. These types are further divided into Dexron II, III, IV, and Mercon V, among others. Each type is designed for specific automatic transmission systems, so it\u2019s crucial to choose the right one for your vehicle.\nYou should use ATF if your vehicle has an automatic transmission. Routine maintenance includes checking the ATF level and condition to ensure it\u2019s within the manufacturer\u2019s recommended specifications. If it\u2019s discolored or has a burnt smell, it\u2019s time for a change.\n\nManual Transmission Fluid (MTF)\n\nMTF, on the other hand, is designed exclusively for manual transmissions. It\u2019s thicker and more viscous than ATF, as manual transmissions operate on a different principle that involves physical gear engagement. You\u2019ll be able to identify that it\u2019s very similar to gear oil, and in some cases, that\u2019s what the transmission needs. MTF is formulated to provide the necessary protection and lubrication for manual transmission components with metal contact.\nSimilar to ATF, there are different types of MTF, and they can vary by viscosity and composition. Common types include GL-4 and GL-5. The choice of MTF will depend on the vehicle\u2019s make and model, so it\u2019s essential to refer to your vehicle\u2019s needs.\nMTF is the go-to fluid for manual transmissions. Regular checks and replacements, as per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations, are essential to maintain the performance and longevity of your manual transmission. If you notice rough or grinding gear shifts, it\u2019s time to consider changing the MTF.\n\nKey Differences Between ATF and MTF\n\nOne of the primary differences between ATF and MTF is their viscosity. ATF is thinner and smoother, whereas MTF is thicker and more weighty. This difference is due to the varied requirements of automatic and manual transmissions.\nAdditives also differ significantly between the two. ATF contains additives that enhance friction properties and prevent wear, which are critical for automatic transmissions. In contrast, MTF includes additives designed to withstand the higher friction and pressure present in manual transmissions.\nATF is engineered to provide smoother gear shifts in automatic transmissions, reducing friction between moving parts. In contrast, MTF has higher friction properties necessary for the precise engagement of gears in manual transmissions. These distinct friction characteristics are a key reason for using the correct fluid type in your vehicle.\nWhile both ATF and MTF play a role in cooling and lubrication, their methods of achieving this differ. ATF\u2019s thinner composition makes it better at dissipating heat generated by automatic transmissions, especially in conjunction with a transmission fluid cooler. MTF\u2019s thicker nature ensures effective lubrication in manual transmissions, preventing excessive wear on gears and other internal parts.\n\nSelecting the Right Transmission Fluid for Your Vehicle\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s manufacturer provides specific guidelines on the type of transmission fluid to use. This information can typically be found in the owner\u2019s manual or on the manufacturer\u2019s website. In many cases, you can also find the fluid spec on the transmission dipstick handle.\nIn addition to manufacturer recommendations, it\u2019s essential to consider the compatibility and specifications of the transmission fluid you\u2019re using. Look for fluids that meet the necessary industry standards and carry the appropriate certifications, such as API or SAE ratings. This ensures that the fluid is suitable for your vehicle\u2019s transmission.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Check Your Transmission Fluid",
        "content": "What functions does transmission fluid play?\n\nTo understand why transmission fluid needs to be checked as part of a regular maintenance routine, it helps to know what it does. Many car owners believe that the fluid\u2019s only purpose is to lubricate the moving parts inside the transmission. While that\u2019s true, there are additional functions it performs.\u00a0\u00a0\nTransmission fluid:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLubricates moving parts to prevent wear, as mentioned.\u00a0\nReduces friction between components to improve efficiency.\u00a0\nCools parts to prevent overheating and damage.\u00a0\nActs as hydraulic fluid for the valve body to change gears.\u00a0\nCoats metal parts to prevent oxidation and corrosion.\u00a0\nConditions seals and gaskets to prevent leaks.\u00a0\n\nIt really is crucial to keep transmission fluid clean and full, or any of these functions could be compromised.\u00a0\n\nWhy is it important to check your transmission fluid?\u00a0\n\nLike any system in your vehicle that uses a fluid \u2013 engine, cooling system, brakes, differentials, and power steering included \u2013 it only works as designed when the correct fluid is contained within the system at the proper level, and in good condition.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the transmission fluid isn\u2019t at the proper level or in good shape, it doesn\u2019t just stop driving or changing gears. An automatic transmission fluid problem often causes serious concerns like burnt clutches, blown seals, or broken gears. Neglecting the simple service item could result in a repair or replacement costing thousands of dollars.\u00a0\n\nSymptoms of Low Transmission Fluid\u00a0\n\nWhat are the signs of low transmission fluid? If the transmission fluid is lower than it should be, symptoms often show up. You might notice that it feels like it drops out of gear while you drive, resulting in the RPMs flaring. When you\u2019re accelerating at a stop, you might need to rev the engine up a bit before it engages and starts to move your car. Eventually, you could smell a pungent burning smell from overheating in the transmission.\nOf course, there\u2019s a reason the fluid is low too. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll see drips on the ground, potentially from a leaking seal or transmission cooler hose, or it could be from damage to the case itself.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn most newer vehicles with an OBDII diagnostic system, the Check Engine Light will come on when the fluid is sufficiently low. Codes related to loss of prime often indicate the fluid is too low.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSteps for Checking Transmission Fluid Level\u00a0\n\nYour car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual is the authoritative source for how to check the transmission fluid level since not all cars are the same. Here are some general tips for checking the fluid.\u00a0\n\n1. Locate the dipstick\n\nUnder your vehicle\u2019s hood, check for a dipstick that extends down toward the transmission. This is where to put fluid if it\u2019s low too. On a 4WD or RWD vehicle, it tends to twist toward the firewall while on FWD and AWD vehicles, it\u2019s typically beside the engine. The top of the dipstick usually has a gear-shaped symbol stamped on it. \nNot all cars have a dipstick, though. Some foreign brands like BMW don\u2019t include one with the vehicle from factory, so relying on dealer services is how to check transmission fluid. Other models equipped with a CVT transmission may not have a dipstick either, and a service facility needs to check the fluid for you. \n\n2. Check it warm and in park\n\nThe transmission fluid should be checked when the vehicle is warm and the transmission is in park on a flat, level surface. Since you want the fluid level checked after it has circulated and filled the lines and areas inside the transmission, you shouldn\u2019t check it when the car is stone-cold. \n\n3. Identify the level\n\nOn the dipstick, locate the low and full levels. There might be a hash-marked section indicating a normal range or there could be words like \u201cMIN\u201d and \u201cMAX\u201d or \u201cFULL\u201d and \u201cADD\u201d. It should be within the minimum and maximum levels for normal operation.  \n\nWhat to Look out for While Checking Your Transmission Fluid\u00a0\n\nMake sure you also check the fluid condition. For most cars, the fluid begins its life a reddish-pink color and changes to brown as it ages. If it\u2019s dark, feels gritty when rubbed between your fingers, or smells burnt, it\u2019s time to change the fluid.\u00a0\n\nHow Often Should Transmission Fluid Get Changed?\u00a0\n\nHow to Change Your Transmission Fluid \u2013 AutoZone How to Videos\nLike engine oil, transmission fluid needs to be changed to prevent mechanical problems and to maintain its benefits mentioned earlier. For some cars, the interval to change the transmission fluid can be 100,000 miles or five years. For vehicles that experience severe service like trucks that tow, the interval could be just 20,000 miles.\u00a0\u00a0\nTransmission fluid changes are more expensive and can cost a couple hundred dollars or more, but since they\u2019re required much less frequently than an oil change, the service averages out to even less per mile.\u00a0\u00a0\nYour best bet to determine when the transmission fluid needs to be replaced is by following the maintenance schedule and keeping an eye on the fluid condition and level. If the fluid is dirty before the interval arrives, play it safe and change it.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re transmission fluid is low or have you have a leak, contact a service professional to have it checked and addressed. You can get transmission fluid at AutoZone, no matter what make or model you drive.

        "title": "Car Leaking Oil? How to Fix Engine Oil Leaks at Home",
        "content": "First, What Causes Oil Leaks?\n\nTo find out how your car is leaking oil, you have to figure out what caused the leak in the first place. There is no use in fixing a problem only to have it occur again. An oil leak can be caused by one of four problems. The most common cause of an oil leak is due to a degraded engine gasket. An engine gasket is a seal that ensures that lubricants do not leak. When there is a break in the gasket, you will begin to lose vehicle fluids. In most cases, you will leak motor oil. The other less common causes of oil leaks are an oil pan leak, oil seals, or bad connections. In order to find out what is causing the leak, you will want to inspect these four areas. \n\nInspecting Your Vehicle for the Cause of the Leak\n\nNow that you know the possible sources of your car leaking oil, it is time to crawl under the car and find out what is causing the problem. First, you will want to check the oil pan seals. Also, you will want to check the oil pan plug. After you check the oil pan, go ahead and take a look at the timing cover seal and the valve cover gaskets. Other places to look for a possible leak include the oil pressure sensor, the oil filter, and the oil cap. If you have an older vehicle with lots of worn parts, then it\u2019s possible that you may have multiple oil leaks.\n\nNow It\u2019s Time to Fix That Oil Leak\n\nAfter you have done your inspection, it\u2019s time to roll up your sleeves and learn how to fix an oil leak. You don\u2019t have to read a whole book to learn how to fix that leak. While there are some oil leaks that can only be fixed by expensive repairs, most can be done in your garage or driveway rather inexpensively. The only thing you will need is a car jack, jack stands, torque wrench, and some special additives or replacement parts (something like a new oil pan). Here are the two main approaches that you can take to fix your oil leak.\n\nUsing an Additive to Stop the Leak\n\nOne of the easiest ways to fix the leak yourself is to use a stop leak additive or high mileage oil blend. Such products can soften and condition your car\u2019s rubber seals to stop and prevent further automotive leaks. It may take up to a few hundred miles of driving before the leak is completely sealed. Next, you\u2019ll learn how to deal with an oil pan leak and other oil leak situations. You should generally try to fix the leak by replacing components before resorting to using stop leak.\n\nFixing the Problem with Tools\n\nDon\u2019t worry. Fixing an oil pan leak and other situations with tools is not as hard as you would think. All you need are some hand tools, a torque wrench, and a car jack and stands or some ramps. First, safely jack up the car so you can safely access the oil pan. Now, check for loose bolts on the oil pan. Over time, these bolts can loosen, and loose bolts leak. After tightening all the bolts on the oil pan, move over to the timing belt cover and the valve covers. Be aware that specific car models require you to tighten bolts in a certain pattern to a specific tolerance level. Check a service manual or repair guide for more information.\n\nAfter You Have Fixed the Leak, It\u2019s Time to Test\n\nOnce you believe you have fixed the problem, it is time to test everything out. Get about a quart of oil and top off your oil level. Afterward, you will want to turn on the engine with the hood up. Check the top of the engine while the car is running. Sometimes, you may find out that the oil is leaking from the gasket or the oil cap, and the engine will start to smoke because it is burning oil. It\u2019s important to know what causes oil leaks from all parts of your vehicle.\nAfter running the car for a couple of minutes, move the vehicle about 5 feet from where it was previously parked. Check to see if any oil leaks have accumulated on the driveway. If you still see an oil puddle, then you have to go back and recheck the tightening of your bolts.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOil leaks are one of the common and frustrating car problems that can occur. Before you take the vehicle to the garage for a hefty repair bill, learn how to fix an oil leak yourself. Remember to check everything from the oil pan to the gaskets and the oil cap. Be sure to double-check and make sure that you fixed the leak after the repair. With a little know-how and more patience, you will be able to handle any oil leak problem on your vehicle.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "What Fluids in a Car Need to be Changed?",
        "content": "Car Fluids You Need to Change\n\n1. Motor Oil\n\nWhen your engine is in operation, a lot of metal parts rub against each other. This rubbing would generate a lot of friction and heat without oil to lubricate the engine\u2019s internals. Engine oil also acts as a coolant to keep hot engine parts, like the bottom of the piston and skirts cool.\nTraditional wisdom puts the oil change interval every 3 months or 3,000 miles, but this interval will differ depending on your year, make, model, and engine, as well as the type of oil you use (conventional or synthetic). Check your owner\u2019s manual for the correct interval.\n\n2. Transmission Fluid\n\nRegardless of whether you have a manual or Automatic transmission, it contains fluid that needs to be changed in intervals. This fluid lubricates the gears and synchros in a manual transmission, and does the same with clutch packs and gears in an automatic transmission. You don\u2019t need to change transmission fluid nearly as often as oil, but it\u2019s important to note that neglecting it can quickly lead to transmission failure, which is nearly as costly a repair as changing an engine. Most manufacturers recommend transmission fluid changes between 25-40,000 miles.\n\n3. Brake Fluid\n\nMost braking systems use hydraulic fluid with a Master Cylinder to compress Brake Calipers, which then squeeze the pads to the rotors and bring the vehicle to the stop. Brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means it absorbs water, which leads to rust, corrosion, and a lower boiling point for brake fluid, which operates at extremely hot temperatures near the caliper. Brake fluid should generally should be flushed every 25,000 miles or when the pads and rotors are replaced. Learn more about flushing brake fluid here.\n\n4. Engine Coolant\n\nEngine coolant, or antifreeze, does what it sounds like it would do: it cools your engine. Without it, the engine would overheat and seize. When you need new coolant and what coolant you need depends on what you drive, so check that owner\u2019s manual, or read here about what antifreeze you need, or how to flush and fill it.\n\n5. Power Steering Fluid\n\nHydraulic power steering systems use hydraulic fluid similarly to how brake fluid works. Over time, this fluid goes through a multitude of heat cycles, gets dirty, and begins to break down. Power steering fluid generally gets neglected the most out of any fluid, but it also tends to last the longest. A service interval of 60-80,000 miles is generally ok.\n\n6. Differential Fluid\n\nNo matter what kind of car you have, you have some form of a differential, which through a series of gears, transmits the engine-to-transmission torque to the axles and wheels. 4 wheel drive vehicles generally have a front and rear differential, and many AWD vehicles have a center differential as well as a rear. This gear oil breaks down over time, gets dirty, and needs to be changed. Most manufacturers put the interval at 80-120,000 miles, so check accordingly.\n\n7. Windshield Washer Fluid\n\nWasher fluid isn\u2019t a crucial maintenance fluid in that your car can still function without it. That said, you\u2019ll regret not topping it up if something gets on your windshield while you\u2019re driving. There are special formulations for removing bugs or ice and frost as well as general purpose fluids. There\u2019s no precise interval for replacing this fluid, but you can check it under the hood and fill up as needed.\nIt\u2019s important to note though, that different washer fluid has different freeze temperatures, and if you live in the northern half of the country that encounters below-15 degree temperatures, it\u2019s important to note that not all washer fluid is equal. Summertime washer fluid, like Bug Wash, can freeze in sub-zero temperatures, rendering your washer system useless when you most need it. Once fall comes, it\u2019s a great idea to get any summertime fluid out, and replace it with De-icer, which is always rated into negative temperatures.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You\n\nFind a Repair Shop",

        "title": "How To Find and Fix Coolant Leaks",
        "content": "Understanding Coolant Leaks\n\nCoolant is an essential fluid. That is, if you do not have the right amount of fluid, you are asking for serious trouble that may include substantial engine damage. As such, you should routinely check your car\u2019s coolant levels. If you regularly find that you are adding new fluid to your system, there is a good chance you have a coolant leak.\n\nHow to Detect Coolant Leaks\n\nCOMMON SOURCES OF COOLANT LEAKS\n\n1. A BLOWN HEAD GASKET\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s head gasket seals the space between its\u00a0cylinder head\u00a0and engine block. If the head gasket fails, coolant, and engine oil may mix. You may also notice that coolant is leaking from the bottom of the engine and dripping onto the ground. Either way, a blown head gasket can be disastrous for your engine.\n\n2. A DAMAGED HEATER CORE\n\nYour\u00a0heater core\u00a0is essentially a small radiator that disperses heat into your vehicle\u2019s passenger cabin. While you cannot see the heater core, it may develop a coolant leak. If it does, fluid may accumulate in the plastic housing on the bottom of the heater core.\n\n3. A CRACKED OR DAMAGED HOSE\n\nCoolant may move through many\u00a0different hoses\u00a0under your vehicle\u2019s hood. If one of these hoses develops a crack or hole, coolant may leak.\n\n4. LOOSE OR WORN-OUT HOSE CONNECTIONS\n\nHoses in your vehicle\u2019s cooling system must connect to different components. Some connections may have\u00a0hose clamps, while others may attach on their own. Any place a hose connects, though, is prone to springing a coolant leak.\n\n5. A BROKEN RADIATOR\n\nModern coolant has anti-corrosive agents that help protect your radiator from damage. Still, sometimes radiators develop holes. If your vehicle\u2019s radiator has one, you may notice a leak in front of your engine.\n\nCoolant leaks are serious business any time of the year. That is, even though coolant is commonly called antifreeze, it is essential year-round. Therefore, if you have a car leaking coolant, you must take the leak seriously. Fortunately, finding a coolant leak may not be as difficult as you may think.\n\nFinding Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nOften, finding a coolant leak is simple, as you can see fluid dripping from beneath your vehicle\u2019s hood. You may also notice bubbles in the\u00a0coolant reservoir\u00a0or at a hose connection. You must be careful when checking fluid levels, though. If the engine is not completely cool before you remove the radiator cap, you may suffer a serious burn from escaping steam or hot coolant. Therefore, you should never open the radiator cap or the coolant reservoir when your car\u2019s engine is hot.\nTypically, a coolant leak presents itself in just a few ways. For example, your vehicle\u2019s engine may overheat. If this happens, the\u00a0temperature gauge\u00a0on your instrument panel is likely to move upward, perhaps into the red zone. You may also notice steam coming from under your hood. Or, your vehicle may stall. If your car has a low-coolant indicator light, it may also illuminate.\nTo locate a coolant leak, first look for puddles of coolant beneath your vehicle. If you see any, you probably have fluid dripping from somewhere in the system. With the car\u2019s engine running, look under the hood to see if you notice any fluid flowing out. If you do, trace the fluid to its source. Do not forget to check hose connections and components for leaks. Allowing your vehicle to climb to normal operating temperature and turning on the air conditioner increases pressure in your coolant system. This procedure may allow you to more easily detect a coolant leak.\nIf you cannot see a leak but you are losing coolant, you may need to perform a\u00a0coolant pressure test. A pressure tester is a hand-held tool that allows you to gauge the pressure inside your cooling system. If you have low pressure, you probably have a leak somewhere.\n\nFixing Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nThe best way to fix a coolant leak is to track down the location of the leak and repair the old, damaged, or ineffective part. For example, if you have a cracked hose, replacing it is the most effective way to\u00a0stop your leak. Some components naturally wear out over time. As such, replacing hoses, the\u00a0radiator cap, or the reservoir tank may eventually become necessary on older vehicles.\nYou certainly should keep an eye on hose clamps. With ordinary engine movement, clamps can work their way loose. Checking to see that clamps are always sufficiently tight may prevent a leak from forming in the first place.\nIf your leak is because of something more serious, such as a\u00a0blown head gasket, your fix is not so simple. While replacing a bad head gasket is the best way to go in the longterm, such a replacement is very labor intensive and expensive, and you may be able to use a\u00a0sealant\u00a0for less serious cracks or breaks. Sealant products may also work for holes in the radiator. If you are looking at a costly repair or replacing, trying a sealant first may be the way to go.\n\nFinishing Your\u00a0Project\n\nEven though you may never want to have to deal with a car leaking coolant, the problem is more common than you may think. You cannot ignore coolant leaks or any other issue with your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. Now that you understand how to find and fix coolant leaks, you are ready to tackle your project. To finish it successfully, always choose\u00a0high-quality replacement parts\u00a0and the right coolant for your vehicle. With some planning and a bit of effort, you can stop your vehicle\u2019s coolant leak and extend the life of its engine. \nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Oil Recycling: How to Dispose of Motor Oil",
        "content": "Why Should You Recycle Motor Oil?\n\nIf you already handle your own oil changes (or have considered starting), you\u2019ve most likely had someone tell you how important it is that you recycle your used oil. Is recycling really that important though? What\u2019s the worst that could happen if you just toss it in the garbage or dump it down the drain? Surely one person\u2019s choice not to bother doesn\u2019t make that big a difference, right? Actually, one batch of oil from a single oil change can make a massive difference one way or the other. Here\u2019s how:\nAs anyone who\u2019s ever dealt with oil knows all too well, it sticks to pretty much everything it touches, including water. Pouring your used oil into the gutter, down a storm drain, or anywhere else it shouldn\u2019t go can contaminate bodies of water like lakes, oceans, and rivers. It can also harm or kill the animals and plants that call it home.The amount of oil involved in just one oil change has the potential to affect up to a million gallons of water.It\u2019s actually illegal to dispose of your used motor oil incorrectly, so insisting on doing so could carry serious repercussions. You may be fined, face jail time, or be held responsible for any clean-up costs. Those can definitely cost a pretty penny.\nLearning how to recycle motor oil isn\u2019t just about avoiding the possible negative consequences of doing otherwise either. Recycled motor oil can be refined and redistributed pretty much indefinitely. Two and a half quarts of clean, user-ready motor oil requires a whopping 42 gallons of crude oil to produce. However, that same amount of clean oil can be repurposed from just a gallon of previously used motor oil. Naturally, recycling is significantly easier on the environment, not to mention a powerful way to reduce your own carbon footprint.\nThe process of recycling used motor oil is actually pretty simple. Here\u2019s how you can go about doing a thorough job each and every time your ride is due for a fresh batch.\n\nHow to Recycle Oil\n\n Contain the oil The key to successful, responsible oil recycling is making sure you capture it all. Lay down a tarp or plastic sheet underneath your work area. Then position a proper container on top of your tarp and underneath your engine to catch the oil as it drains. (A drip pan that comes complete with a spout is going to be your best pick.) Empty the filter Make sure you include your oil filter in your efforts! Start by puncturing a small hole in the dome of your filter and allowing it to drain thoroughly into your drip pan along with the rest of the oil you\u2019ve collected. Then seal the filter into a plastic bag. Even after you\u2019ve drained it, it could contain many ounces of residual oil and can be recycled as well. Get your oil ready for transportation When you\u2019re done, you may need to transfer your oil from your drip pan to another container for storage and transportation, but it\u2019s important to select one that\u2019s appropriate. Don\u2019t use milk cartons, empty juice containers, or any other random container you may have lying around the house. If you happen to have the original container the oil came in, you should use that. Otherwise, you\u2019ll want to use something made of polyethylene or another plastic deemed suitable for the purpose. Also, some oil pans are made such that they can be sealed closed. These pans make it easy to contain and transport used oil.Motor oil that\u2019s been mixed with other fluids (either accidentally or purposefully) isn\u2019t recyclable, so take care not to let yours mingle with washer fluid, gasoline, or any other liquid (water included). Make sure your storage container has never been used to store other fluids at any point, even if it was a long time ago. Storing used oil  \nWhat Should You Do With\u00a0Successfully Collected Oil?\n\nDepending on where you live, you may be able to turn your used motor oil in via your city\u2019s curbside recycling program. If your city does allow for this, make sure you carefully research packaging requirements and protocol. (Never simply toss a container of used motor oil into your standard recycling bin.) If curbside recycling for motor oil isn\u2019t a possibility in your city, then you\u2019ll need to make plans to drop it off yourself at a participating recycling center.\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not quite sure where to take your oil or if the nearest recycling center is a little off the beaten trail for you. Most AutoZone stores accept used motor oil, as well as other sensitive recyclables (like batteries). Get in touch with your friendly neighborhood location today for all the details. When you\u2019re done dropping off your used oil, you can pick up a fresh jug of new\u00a0engine oil\u00a0while you\u2019re there. Get started today!",

        "title": "What Does Oil Do for a Car's Engine?",
        "content": "What Does Motor Oil Actually Do?\n\nWhat does Motor Oil Do?\nTo understand the function of motor oil, it\u2019s first important to at least get a basic understanding of how your engine works. You don\u2019t need to get too technical to really understand what oil does: rather, the most important thing to understand is that there are many moving parts inside your engine. These moving parts not only rub against each other, they also produce a great amount of heat.\nEssentially, motor oil acts as the lubricant that allows all of these moving parts inside your engine to rub against each other and not overheat or wear out quickly. If you were to try and drive your car with no motor oil inside of it, very quickly, that heat and friction would cause the engine to weld itself into a useless piece of metal. When this happens to a car engine, the engine seizes or \u201clocks up.\u201d Once an engine is locked up, there\u2019s basically nothing that can be done to fix it. Other than, of course, replacing the entire engine.\nObviously, most motorists want to avoid this, and thus ensure that their car has sufficient motor oil to coat and protect its moving parts against excessive wear.\nIn addition to the heat generated from all of the moving components of the engine rubbing against each other, engines run off of a process called internal combustion. This process of combustion produces a lot of water vapor, carbon, acids, and several other byproducts.\nWay back in the day, engines actually didn\u2019t have an oil pump to help move the oil around the engine. Rather, they used a very rudimentary system of dippers on the crankshaft which would then splash oil upward and cover the moving parts of the engine with oil. (Many lawn mowers still operate this way.)\nHowever, this process is obviously imperfect, and usually would result in a locked up engine after a period of time. Over time the process of\u202foil delivery\u202fdid improve, but it also took a while for\u202foil filters\u202fto start showing up on automobiles; they were still considered an option well into the 1950\u2019s. What a filter does is help remove unwanted particles from the oil, such as carbon and metals. Prior to the addition of oil filters, older engines would need to go through a process known as \u201cde-coking\u201d in order to remove the build-up, which would settle in the oil pan, or anywhere motor oil could pool.\n\u201cDe-coking\u201d would involve running a mixture of diluted kerosene and oil through the engine as a flush, and hope that it would help remove some of the carbon and sludge buildup. However, this was also not a very precise process or thorough process, and normally wouldn\u2019t do much, if not damage the engine. Thus, prior to modern oils now have detergents to battle this, along with oil filters. In the \u201cgood old days\u201d, engines would rarely make it over 100,000 miles without needing to be rebuilt. Anyone who has cracked open an older engine from the 1950\u2019s to the 1970\u2019s usually has a story about \u201cthat one engine\u201d that had enough sludge in it that it was a wonder it ever ran at all.\nBasically, your car\u2019s engine is a very complex place, and, due to the movement and heat generated by the process of combustion, a very dirty place. Not only does oil lubricate the parts inside of your engine to ensure overheating does not occur, it also helps to keep the engine clean.\n\nDoes Switching Between Conventional and Synthetic Oils Cause Problems?\n\nOriginally, all motor oils were mineral-based. After years of development, synthetic blend oil started to appear on the market. For a while, it was \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that switching to a synthetic oil after using mineral-based oils in an engine would result in problems like burning oil or potential leakage.\nAt this point, these theories have all but been disproven. (This is similar to how some people swear up and down that manual cars get better gas mileage as compared to automatic cars. This may have had plausibility at one time, but not so much anymore.) In fact, synthetic motor oil is actually better than conventional oil in a multitude of ways.\nFirst of all, synthetic oil has a higher percentage of purity as compared to conventional oils. Conventional oils are going to have a certain amount of impurities by its very nature: for example, paraffin molecules. On the other hand, synthetic oil is pure all the way through. This means lubricity is better, and ultimately longevity is better.  \nAdditionally, synthetic oil was invented for the sole purpose of having an oil that could maintain a better viscosity in extreme cold and hot temperatures. All oils are going to thicken up drastically as the temperature plummets, but synthetic oils will maintain a better viscosity at these extreme temperatures, and adversely, in extreme heat, will resist vaporization better.\nParticularly if your car is a more modern model, it\u2019s important to go with synthetic oil. This is because synthetic oil has much greater shear strength as compared to conventional oil. Basically, if there is enough pressure, the very molecules of conventional oil can be torn apart. This doesn\u2019t happen with synthetic oil, and given the very tight tolerances of modern engine build, this strength factor is paramount for peak engine performance and protection.\nNo matter what kind of vehicle you own, it\u2019s very important for the engine to have an appropriate amount and variety of motor oil. Failure to have enough can result in engine lockage, meaning that you\u2019ll have a very expensive mess on your hands. Make sure to change your oil and oil filter regularly for top performance.",

        "title": "Motor Oil: What Do Grades Mean For Your Engine?",
        "content": "What Are the Numbers on an Oil Container?\n\nThe numbers indicate the oil grade, which is a measure of its viscosity. A layman can think of viscosity as a liquid\u2019s thickness. Consider the difference between pouring a glass of water versus waiting for the ketchup to slide out of the bottle. Ketchup has a high viscosity whereas water has very low viscosity.\nNow imagine trying to put a number on the difference between the thickness of ketchup and water. This was exactly the problem faced by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) with oil viscosity. The SAE\u2019s solution was the measure the rate at which oil traveled through a standardized opening at specific temperatures.\nThe grades you see on bottles represent the measurements based on flow time. It\u2019s not as simple as saying \u201chigher numbers are better\u201d because some oils perform better at different temperatures than others. The oil you want depends on your vehicle and the environment in which you drive.\n\nWhat Does the W Mean?\n\nWhile many drivers think it means weight, the W in the grade actually stands for winter. The first number can be thought of as the oil\u2019s cold-temperature performance. Oil thickens as it becomes colder, making it harder to pump through your engine. Pancake syrup is an excellent visualization here as it\u2019s fairly thick when cold but almost water-like when hot.\nThe difference in the viscosity is the reason you see multiple numbers on grades, such as 5W-30. The number preceding the W is a measurement of the oil\u2019s flow at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The lower the first number is, the better the oil flows at below freezing temperatures. So 0W-30 would be a better cold-weather lubricant than 5W-30.\nThis is important because if oil becomes too thick it becomes almost impossible for your system to pump. A sudden surge of cold, thick lubricant can put a hole in your filter, preventing it from cleaning your oil properly. If no oil is pumped at all, you experience a catastrophic engine failure. Always use the correct winter ratings when driving in a cold environment.\n\nWhat Does the Number After the Dash Mean?\n\nWhile engines are always hot when they run, hot weather puts even more stress on your oil. In the cold, having a thin oil prevents your car\u2019s lubricant from becoming too thick. High temperatures thin out your oil, necessitating a higher viscosity. If oil becomes too thin, it doesn\u2019t clean your engine well. The debris in your system causes poor performance and gas mileage. Even worse, thin oil doesn\u2019t absorb enough heat, which can cause your engine to overheat and fail.\nThink of the number after the dash as the oil\u2019s high-temperature rating. In this case, the SAE measures the time it takes for the oil to travel through an opening at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the second number of the grade is, the better the oil stands up to heat. Using 20W-50, for instance, would be an excellent choice if you lived in the tropics.\nThat\u2019s why 5W-30 is one of the most commonly used lubricants. In temperate regions, such as most of the United States and Europe, it works well whether you\u2019re driving in the summer or winter. This is why multi-grade oils have become so popular in recent years: they provide better overall protection than monograde lubricants.\n\nWhat Does It Mean When There\u2019s No Dash?\n\nIf you see a rating such as SAE 30, this is a monograde oil. Chances are this bottle is not designed as an automotive lubricant. All modern engines use oil whether they\u2019re on cars or not. Some don\u2019t need the advanced lubricants used by today\u2019s automobiles. Riding mowers, generators, and chainsaws can run just fine on monograde oil.\nYou may be wondering, \u201cCan you use SAE 30 motor oil in a car?\u201d The answer is that this type is generally suitable only for antique cars. Even if it rarely gets cold near you, it\u2019s best not to risk your engine during an early morning ignition. Multi-grade oils protect your vehicle and help it to work better as well.\n\nWhat Kind of Oil Should I Buy?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about the exact temperature of your driving environment every time you buy oil. Your car or truck has all the info you need about purchasing oil in its service manual. It should tell you the exact type and grade used by your engine. It may even have recommendations for cold- or hot-weather oils if you\u2019re doing some traveling.\nIf you live somewhere with wide temperature swings, don\u2019t fret about finding the perfect lubricant.\n5W-40 oil works well in freezing or sweltering conditions, so it\u2019s always a good choice provided it matches your engine. Even if it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t forget that you change your oil multiple times during the year. This gives you the opportunity to switch grades to match the next season\u2019s weather.\nWhile motor oil grades can be surprisingly complex, finding the right one is fairly easy. As long as you check your owner\u2019s manual you should get the right lubricant. If you\u2019re interested in saving money, do your own oil changes. Not only is it much cheaper, you get a better feel for the condition of your vehicle. Oil replacements are the most important kind of regular maintenance on your car, so it\u2019s a good idea to take charge of them yourself. Shop engine oil online to find high-quality lubricants at the right price.\nLearn more about motor oil:\n\nThe advantages of synthetic oil\nWhat is high mileage oil?",

        "title": "Car Tune-Up Checklist",
        "content": "What is a Tune-Up?\nThe term \u201ctune-up\u201d has drastically changed since the phrase was coined during the dawn of automobiles. For over 50 years, a tune-up meant that the vehicle\u2019s ignition system \u2013 breaker points and condenser, were replaced and/or adjusted, a new distributor cap, rotor, and spark plugs were installed, ignition timing was set, and the vehicles carburetor was adjusted and \u201ctuned\u201d (hence the term) for optimal performance. The process was as intricate as tuning a musical instrument \u2013 ignition and fueling had to work in perfect tune with each other for optimal performance, thus the term. \nWith vehicles of old, this was a regular occurrence. As electronic ignition replaced points-style systems, the need was still there for plugs, cap, rotor, and carb adjustments, but ultimately, even that became extinct once DIS (distributorless) ignition systems and computer-based fuel injection became the norm. Today, the vehicle\u2019s engine computer and engine components constantly keep these systems running right where they should. \nToday, at its simplest, a tune-up is a bit of a misnomer \u2013 simply a carry-over word of old to describe any time a host of basic routine maintenance is performed on your vehicle. Regular tune-ups can extend the life of a vehicle and help ensure it is operating at its full performance potential. Typically, when to do a tune-up is included in the regular maintenance section of owner\u2019s manuals.\nTuning-up your car today can mean a lot of things. It\u2019s a good idea to check the car\u2019s filters, belts, hoses, and fluids. Also, it\u2019s a good idea if you don\u2019t know the last time you replaced your spark plugs and/or wires/coil boots, now could be a good time. Many may not need to be replaced, but it will give you a chance to stop small issues that could develop into big problems if left unchecked. If you want to learn how to do some of the repairs listed below, consult one of our How-To articles. If you need more detailed vehicle-specific information, check out our Repair Help guides and diagrams.\nCheck out the list below to find the parts and systems that you should check in a tune-up. You don\u2019t need to do all of these things every time, but it\u2019s always a good idea to make sure these are working correctly.\n\nWhat Does a Tune-Up Consist of?\n\n1. Replace Plugs, Wires, and Other Ignition Parts\n\nThe ignition system consists of\u202fspark plugs, plug wires, coils, and other electrical components that ignite the air/fuel mixture in your combustion chamber. The system has changed drastically over the years, where newer ignition systems require only spark plugs and wires/coil boots to be changed at a certain mileage. Older vehicles, as stated before, can have a distributor cap and rotor, and even older, can have breaker points.\nSpark Plugs\n\nSpark plugs have a metal tip (electrode) that wears down over time from high heat and constant electrical arc.\nA symptom of worn spark plugs is a misfire, when the fuel/air mixture in a cylinder fails to ignite.\nWhen replacing spark plugs, it is highly recommended to use plugs of the original equipment (OE) recommended metal. Consult your owner\u2019s manual, repair manual or the experts at AutoZone to learn which is the recommended spark plug metal is right for you or check out our other blogs on spark plugs.\nBe sure to use a light application of anti-seize on the threads of the plugs prior to installation (avoid getting anti-seize anywhere else but the threads).\n\nIn DIS (distributorless) applications that use one coil for multiple plugs, be sure to use either Double Platinum or Iridium plugs as recommended by the manufacturer.\nIf you need some help on replacing yours, check out our guide on\u202fhow to change spark plugs.\nIgnition Wires\n\nIgnition wires will break down over time and eventually fail.\nSymptoms of a failed wire are rough idle, misfire, performance loss, and eventually a dead cylinder.\nWhen replacing a distributor cap or ignition wires, transfer one wire at a time from the old cap to the new cap. This prevents the ignition system from becoming cross wired, which result in a rough running engine. You can make this job easier by using a spark plug boot tool.\nUse dielectric grease in the boots to help prevent arcing and help make future boot removal easier.\nBe sure that your wires are secure and routed away from exhaust components.\n\nIgnition Coils\n\nCoils transform low battery voltage into thousands of volts. Over time this high voltage electricity wears out the coils out.\nSigns your coils may be worn out include engine misfires, weakened acceleration, rough idle, and reduced gas mileage.\nSome vehicles use coil packs, which are typically located near the valve covers, while others use a coil-on-plug design that are over or close to the spark plugs.\nPut dielectric grease on the boot of coil-on-plug coils.\n\nDistributor Cap and Rotor and Breaker Points (If Applicable)\n\nNumerous rotations of the rotor inside the distributor will cause the metal contact point to wear down.\nA failed distributor cap causes misfires or in more severe cases a non-start.\nWhen performing a tune-up it is suggested to replace both the cap and rotor at the same time.\nTransfer ignition wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap. This prevents the ignition system from becoming cross wired, which result in a rough running engine. You can make this job easier by using a spark plug boot tool.\nOlder vehicles pre-1974 usually contain breaker-points which need to be adjusted / replaced on a regular basis.\n\n2. Let Your Engine Run Clean with New Filters\n\nFilters in your vehicle consist of: oil, fuel, air, and cabin air filters. Filters keep contaminating particles from reaching vital components in your engine and related systems. Having a clean filter improves engine performance and efficiency. Dirty filters make your vehicle work harder to get the air, fuel, and oil that it needs. This can choke off your engine or decrease the ability to deliver air, oil or fuel at the proper pressure.\nEngine Air Filter\n\nFilters thousands of gallons of air for every gallon of fuel and will clog over time.\nClogged air filters can reduce performance, but not MPGs on fuel injected engines*.\nClogged air filters in carbureted engines can reduce MPG\u2019s by 2-6% and up to 14%*. \nReplacing your\u202fair filter is generally a simple task, check out our\u202fair filter replacement guide\u202fif you need help.\n\n*Based on a testing claim from\u202ffueleconomy.gov\nCabin Air Filter\n\nSome vehicles are equipped with a cabin air filtration system and thus have a replaceable filter element to keep the air inside the vehicle clean.\nA dirty cabin air filter can allow dust, pollen, exhaust fumes and other contaminants into your vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and restrict airflow into the vehicle.\nMost cabin air filters are easily accessible and take less than 15 minutes to change. Learn how from this\u202fcabin air filter guide.\n\nOil Filter\n\nDirty oil can lead to excessive wear on internal engine components.\nAn oil filter is used to filter vital engine oil of contamination and can clog if not replaced at recommended intervals.\nCan lead to high oil pressure in severe circumstances of clogging.\nShould be replaced with every\u202foil change at recommended intervals. Learn more from\u202foil change guide.\n\nFuel Filter\n\nDirty fuel and contaminated fuel tanks can clog your fuel filter and lead to low fuel pressure, sometimes resulting in hesitation while accelerating or rough idling.\nCan lead to premature fuel pump failure in severe circumstances.\nShould be replaced with every\u202foil change at recommended intervals.\n\nPCV Valve\n\nOver time the Positive Crankcase Ventilation Valve can become clogged by carbon build up.\nFailure can cause the engine to consume oil at a much faster rate, cause poor fueling conditions, misfires, and actually blow out gaskets due to pressure accumulating in the crankcase.\nThe PCV Valve is usually easy to replace. In many cases, it can be swapped out in a matter of a few minutes.\n\n3. Keep Your Auxiliary Systems in Check with New Belts and Hoses\n\nBelts connect the pulleys of your accessory drive system which transfer the rotating force of the crankshaft pulley to the\u202falternator, water\u202fpump, power steering pump, and other systems. Hoses transfer vital fluids throughout the engine. Over time, belts and hoses wear down due to the elements they are exposed to such as heat and cold as well as the constant use they see with day to day operation of the vehicle. They eventually wear down, glaze over, turn brittle, crack and even break.\nSerpentine Belt\n\nThe serpentine belt rides in a series of pulleys on the front of your engine.\nThe belt wears down, and needs replacement because of exposure to heat and stress.\nInspect the belt(s) for cracks, fraying, glazing or fluid contamination. Any of these conditions can cause the belt to slip or break.\nIf you need help changing the belt out, check our\u202fserpentine belt replacement guide.\n\nBelt Tensioner\n\nThe belt tensioner maintains the correct belt tension.\nA weak belt tensioner will cause premature belt wear.\nA \u2018tight or sticking\u2019 belt tensioner will cause premature wear to the water pump and other accessory bearings.\nWith the belt off, rotate the tensioner through its arc of travel. It should move smoothly and provide firm tension.\nWhile the belt is off check the idler and tensioner pulley, plus accessory pulleys for proper alignment and smooth rotation \u2013 if any roughness or noise is detected in any pulley \u2013 replace it at this time.\n\nTiming Belt\n\nThe timing belt controls the internal mechanical timing on many engines. This belt usually has an 80,000 \u2013 100,000 mile life cycle, and then must be replaced, along with any tensioner or idler components that run the belt.\nWhen a timing belt breaks on most vehicles, the piston can and will come in contact with valves that are stuck open which causes catastrophic damage.\nThe timing belt is an intricate job, and should be replaced on the recommended mileage intervals.\nWhen inspecting your timing belt, take the time to check the cam and crank seals for leaks.\nSome vehicles feature a\u202ftiming chain\u202finstead of a timing belt. Timing chains typically do not need to be replaced as often, and usually have a much longer life cycle, although tensioner components which keep the chain tight can fail.\n\nHoses\n\nRadiator hoses and heater hoses circulate coolant through the engine and the radiator to expel the heat absorbed.\nMost hoses are made of rubber and will break down over time. You can find out of it is time to replace your hoses by inspecting them for swelling, bulging, or leaks. When the engine is cool, squeeze the hoses to feel for hard spots and soft spots.\nCheck the hose clamps for damage or loss of tension too. You don\u2019t want one to let go while your engine\u2019s hot.\nIf a hose were to fail, the engine could overheat. Overheating can cause serious, sometimes irreparable damage to the engine.\n\n4. Maintain Your Car with the Right Fluids\n\nEngine oil, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid are necessary for your vehicle to operate properly. Contaminated fluids can lead to excessive wear on internal components. You can save money in the long run by servicing these fluids before expensive damage occurs. Regular change intervals exist for each type of fluid and as such, they need to be replaced at recommended service intervals, find out more by consulting your owner\u2019s manual or by visiting Repair Help.\nMotor Oil\n\nAs oil circulates through your engine and is exposed to heat and pressure, the oil will become contaminated.\nAn oil filter will keep large particles from being recirculated, but will not keep the oil from providing a protective barrier of lubrication.\nReplace the oil filter during an oil change.\nOil should be replaced at manufacturer recommended mileage or time intervals, consult your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nCoolant\n\nYour cooling system keeps your engine from overheating in the summer and prevents your engine from freezing in the winter.\nCoolant will eventually break down and become contaminated which results in degraded flow and the fluid\u2019s ability to fight corrosion.\nFlushing your cooling system with a flush product specifically designed to remove deposits regularly will improve the performance of your cooling system.\nAlways refer to your owner\u2019s manual to determine the recommended coolant for your vehicle. Different manufacturers require the use of different types of coolant and using a fluid other than what\u2019s specified by the manufacturer can result in engine damage.\nBe sure to mix the coolant with the correct amount of water or use a pre-mixed product that\u2019s ready to pour in.\nShould you decide to change your coolant, check out our\u202fcoolant flush and fill guide.\n\nBrake Fluid\n\nBrake fluid is a vital fluid in your vehicle, without it you would not be able to stop.\nDOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid are hygroscopic, which means the fluid will absorb moisture from the air. This added moisture lowers the fluids ability to operate efficiently as a hydraulic fluid and causes internal corrosion in the braking system.\nDark or muddy looking fluid is a sure sign of hygroscopic contamination.\nIt is recommended that the brake fluid be changed out for fresh fluid and the brake system bled to ensure that new clean fluid is flowing throughout the entire system.\n2 years is the recommended changing interval. Learn how to do it yourself with our\u202fguide on how to bleed brakes.\n\nAutomatic Transmission Fluid (ATF)\n\nAutomatic transmissions use friction packs, along with gearing to operate, which in turn needs a fluid to regulate that friction. This creates a ton of heat and results in wear of internal components and contamination of transmission fluid. This wear and tear makes it imperative to follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for transmission fluid and filter change.\nBrown transmission fluid is an indication that the fluid needs to be changed but, if the fluid is muddy or smells very burnt, do NOT change, instead, take your vehicle to a professional for a professional diagnosis and opinion on how to proceed.\nBe sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual for recommended change intervals as well as the correct fluid type to be used.\n\nPower Steering Fluid\n\nOver time contamination can cause wear to the power steering pump.\nBe sure that your power steering fluid does not appear muddy and is between the MAX and MIN levels in the reservoir.\nBe sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual for recommended change intervals as well as the correct fluid type to be used.\n\nYou can get great benefits from performing a tune-up on your vehicle. It\u2019s one of the best ways to maintain original performance. In fact, fixing a car that is badly out of tune can give a noticeable boost to both engine performance and fuel economy*. A vehicle running in top shape today prevents and lessens costly repairs tomorrow. AutoZone\u2019s tune-up guide will show you the common parts that are replaced when tuning up a vehicle such as spark plugs, plug wires, air filter and fuel filter. It\u2019s also a great time to check other components under the hood such as belts, hoses, and fluids.\nConsider purchasing a repair manual or\u202fregister on AutoZone.com to view free repair guides\u202fthat give information on how to replace these parts as they relate to your vehicle\u2019s specific needs.\n*In vehicles with major emissions issues or carbureted vehicles.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "content": "What is Zinc, anyway?\n\nZinc is the only element that starts with Z, and it\u2019s a vitamin listed on food packaging, which are the two things that make it the most famous. It\u2019s also used to fight corrosion, as a galvanizing agent, is critical to create brass, and shows up in thousands of compounds that affect your everyday life. Check out the Zinc wiki page with 270+ sources to read up on all that.\nWe\u2019re here to talk about motor oil. \n\nWhat does Zinc have to do with motor oil?\n\n\u201cZinc\u201d in motor oil usually is describing a compound called  Zinc Dialkyl Dithiophosphates or ZDDP. According to Valvoline, \u201cits primary role is to prevent metal-to-metal contact between engine parts by forming a protective film. Despite being referred to as zinc, ZDDP also contains phosphorus, which helps to perform the anti-wear function in the motor oil.\u201d\nZinc acts as a friction inhibitor, and research suggests that older engines using \u201cflat tappet\u201d lifters in the engine (pretty much any V6 or V8 older than 1988) need to have zinc present in the engine oil in order to keep the camshaft and lifters from wearing prematurely.  \n\nSo why isn\u2019t Zinc or ZDDP in modern motor oil?\n\nHerein lies the problem. About 10 years ago, it was also discovered that in general oil consumption, Zinc, especially the phosphorus present in ZDDP, is a primary cause of premature catalytic converter failure. With the government setting mandates on manufacturers covering the service life of catalytic converters over 100,000 miles, this caused nearly every oil manufacturer over the last 10 years to slowly remove zinc from the ingredients in their oil. Diesel oils soon followed suit, until today, no oil that is approved for on-road use contains Zinc. This of course doesn\u2019t affect newer engines with roller lifters or overhead cams at all \u2013 but for older engines \u2013 it limits the options for oils with ZDDP.  \nCurrently, very few oils on the market contain zinc \u2013 and all of these are designated as \u201coff-road\u201d oils, such as Valvoline racing oil. However, if you\u2019re looking to add Zinc, there are of Zinc additives, that, when coupled with your favorite oil, provide the protection you need.  \n\nZinc is not only critical for older flat-tappet engines, but many argue it\u2019s critical for new engine break-in. An engine\u2019s break in period is critical for its long-term success, as everything from main and rod bearings, to rings, cams and oil pump are getting adjusted to their new life.  Remember, if you have an older vehicle, whether it\u2019s a 1966 Mustang or a 1979 Ford pickup, it\u2019s a good idea to put zinc into the oil. \nMore on Synthetic and Conventional Oil\nNeed Zinc additive or oil advice?

        "title": "What's Causing My Coolant Reservoir to Overflow?",
        "content": "WHAT\u2019S CAUSING MY COOLANT RESERVOIR TO OVERFLOW?\n\n1. COOLANT\u00a0LEVEL\n\nBe sure you have the proper level of coolant in your vehicle. Overfilling may cause overflowing.\n\n2. RADIATOR CAP\n\nCheap and easy to replace, this is the first thing to check. Your problem may simply be a loose or damaged cap not keeping coolant where it needs to be. The radiator cap is designed to allow access to fluids in a \u2018closed\u2019 system. The coolant used to cool the engine does so at maximum efficiency when kept at specific pressure. Check your owner\u2019s manual for proper cap replacement. The radiator cap comes in different pressures.\n\n3. THERMOSTAT\n\nMost of the rest of these problems will cause a check engine light to turn on, but they could have an issue and not be noticed by your vehicle\u2019s computer. A bad thermostat can improperly regulate fluid, and can lead to overflow.\n\n4. WATER PUMP\n\nHow to tell if your over heating problem is caused by the water pump. Faulty water pumps slow or stop the flow of fluid through the cooling system. The result is overheating of the engine. You will see coolant fluid on the ground and around the water pump when the water pump has gone bad. Water pumps either work properly or go bad in a hurry. There is no \u201ckeeping an eye on it\u201d for validation.\n\n5. RADIATOR\n\nIf the cap, thermostat and water pump are all fine, the reservoir is overflowing most likely because of a radiator problem. In older automobiles, the radiator was made of copper and aluminum. In more modern automobiles, the radiator contains a lot of plastic. The plastic radiator are light weight, but tend to ware out faster. Replacing the radiator is recommended over applying a patch if the leak is found.\n\n6. CRACKED HEAD OR BLOCK, OR HEAD GASKET LEAK\n\nIf you\u2019re seeing gas bubbles or some boiling in the liquid when you remove the radiator cap, a cracked head or block may be to blame. Do not remove a radiator cap from a hot engine to check. You can experience a shot of boiling water exploding under pressure. Your local repair shop can perform test to identify cylinder head or engine block cracks.",

        "title": "Synthetic Oil vs. Conventional Oil -- Which Is Better?",
        "content": "What Should I Put In My Car?\n\nSynthetic and Conventional motor oil will both protect your engine, but synthetic oil will do it as much as 47% better* and resist breakdown under extreme temperature conditions. As with most maintenance, best practice is to follow the advice in your owner\u2019s manual. If your car does not absolutely require a certain type of oil, you can choose between the products based on performance and cost. While synthetic motor oils tend to be more expensive, they are shown to reduce buildup of sludge and operate more efficiently under extreme temperatures. For cars with over 75,000 miles, be sure to use a high mileage oil.\n\nBetter Protection For Longer\n\nJust like conventional oil, synthetic motor oils act as a barrier, protecting your engine components. When battling heat and friction, over time the additives in both oils will begin to break down, reducing their ability to protect your engine.\n\nReady to Go In, Hot or Cold\n\nSynthetics provide better cold weather protection through faster oil flow at start up. They also tend to resist breakdown better in high-heat situations, like summer or high-performance conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s Still About a Fit\n\nIf you\u2019re thorough and consistent about changing your oil on time, conventional motor oil will protect your engine. If you\u2019re looking for a product that is less likely to break down, or you\u2019re living and driving in a place with some major cold or extreme heat, synthetic oil can provide peace of mind along with superior protection. And if you\u2019re driving a performance vehicle, synthetic oil is almost always recommended.\n\nBetter for Turbo\n\nMany modern engines utilize a turbocharger for additional power, making heat resistance demands higher.

        "title": "How to Change Oil in a Car",
        "content": "Why Changing Oil is Crucial\n\nChanging your car\u2019s oil can\u2019t undo past problems, but it certainly helps to prevent new ones. Oil serves as the lifeblood of your engine, lubricating its components, reducing friction, and carrying away heat. Over time, engine oil breaks down, loses its effectiveness, and can become contaminated with debris. Regular oil changes are crucial because they:\n\nProlong engine life. Clean oil helps reduce wear and tear on engine parts, extending its lifespan.\u00a0\nEnhance fuel efficiency. Fresh oil allows the engine to operate more efficiently, improving gas mileage.\nBoost performance. A well-lubricated engine performs better, providing a smoother and more powerful ride.\nPrevent costly repairs. Neglecting oil changes can lead to expensive engine damage.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize the signs that your car is due for an oil change, which may include:\n\nOil pressure light. If a light shaped like an oil can illuminates on your dashboard, it could be a sign of low oil or sludge buildup that\u2019s blocking oil flow.\nLoud engine noise. An unusually loud engine noise, often described as knocking or tapping, can be a symptom of inadequate lubrication.\nDirty or dark oil. Checking your oil level and color on the dipstick can give you a quick indication of its condition. Clean oil is amber or light brown, while dirty oil is dark and sludgy.\nAn indicator is lit on the dash. A \u2018service required\u2019 warning on the cluster or another maintenance reminder might come up. Often, it indicates oil life remaining, and anything under 10% means it\u2019s urgent to get it done.\n\nGathering the Necessary Tools\n\nBefore you dive into changing your car\u2019s oil, gather the right tools and materials. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\nOil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter.\nOil drain pan to collect the old oil for disposal.\nSocket set for loosening and tightening the oil drain plug.\nOil filter that\u2019s correct for your vehicle\u2019s make and model.\nNew engine oil of the recommended oil type and quantity for your engine.\nOil funnel to pour the new oil in.\nOil filter gasket if necessary. It\u2019s usually included with the new oil filter.\nOil filter wrench to remove and replace the oil filter.\n\nMaintaining an organized workspace can make the process go so much smoother. Here are some tips to help you stay organized:\n\nChoose the right location. Park your car on a level surface and ensure you have enough space to work comfortably.\nGather your tools and materials first. Lay out everything you need in advance, so you don\u2019t have to hunt for items while working.\nWear appropriate clothing. Dress in clothes you don\u2019t mind getting dirty, and consider using gloves to protect your hands.\nHave safety equipment nearby. Keep safety equipment like gloves, safety goggles, and a fire extinguisher within reach.\n\nStep-by-Step Oil Change Process\n\nNow that you\u2019re prepared let\u2019s dive into the step-by-step process of changing your car\u2019s oil.\n\nLocate the Oil Drain Plug and Filter\n\nStep 1: Locate the drain plug. Typically, it\u2019s at the rear side of the engine oil pan at the bottom. Position the oil drain pan beneath the oil drain plug.\nStep 2: Locate the oil filter. It will be either a metal cylinder that threads onto an oil filter adapter under your car or at the side of the engine, or it will be a cartridge that\u2019s inserted into a housing under the hood. If you\u2019re having trouble identifying the oil filter on your car, look in your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nDrain the Old Oil and Replacing the Filter\n\nStep 3: Drain the oil. Use the socket set to carefully loosen and remove the oil drain plug. Allow the old oil to drain completely into the pan.\nStep 4: Remove the oil filter. Once the oil is drained, remove the old oil filter using an oil filter wrench for cylinders, or remove the cap on the housing under the hood and pull out the old cartridge.\nStep 5: Lubricate the gasket. Before installing the new filter, apply a small amount of fresh oil to the rubber gasket. This will help promote a seal and let you tighten it enough.\nStep 6: Install the oil filter. Screw the new oil filter onto the filter housing, ensuring it\u2019s snug but not over-tightened.\nStep 7: Tighten the drain plug. Replace the oil drain plug and tighten it securely. It\u2019s often recommended to torque the drain plug to around 30 lb-ft, but check your owner\u2019s manual for the correct spec for your car.\n\nAdd New Oil and Check the Level\n\nStep 8: Add oil. Using a funnel, pour the recommended amount of new motor oil into the engine. When you\u2019re done, it should be between the \u2018FULL\u2019 and \u2018ADD\u2019 marks on the dipstick.\nStep 9: Run the engine and recheck the level.\u00a0 Run the engine to circulate the oil throughout. Then, recheck the oil level using the dipstick. Add more oil if necessary, but avoid overfilling.\n\nAlways use the proper equipment and be safe and careful when you\u2019re working on your car. If you jack up the front end of your car to change the oil, chock the rear wheels to prevent it from rolling and engage the parking brake. Let the engine cool sufficiently so you won\u2019t burn yourself when you\u2019re working on the engine or near the exhaust.\nThen, at the end, double-check that there aren\u2019t leaks or drips under your car.\n\nOil Disposal and Environmental Considerations\n\nNever dispose of used oil by pouring it down the drain or on the ground. Improper disposal of used oil can harm the environment, contaminating soil and water sources. Recycling used oil ensures that it can be cleaned and reused, reducing the need for new oil production and its associated environmental impact.\n\nOil Change Frequency and Maintenance Tips\n\nOil change intervals can vary depending on your vehicle\u2019s make, model, and the type of oil used. A general guideline is to change your oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles or as recommended in your car\u2019s manual. However, modern vehicles and synthetic oils may allow for longer intervals \u2013 sometimes up to 15,000 miles or one year. Always consult your manual for specific recommendations.\nRegular oil changes are just one part of maintaining your vehicle. Consider these additional maintenance tasks to keep your car in top shape:\n\nCheck tire pressure and tread depth regularly.\nCheck the wiper blades and replace them as necessary, typically once a year. Periodically inspect the brakes, suspension, and steering, and lubricate any service points.\nCheck and top off fluids like coolant, transmission fluid, and brake fluid.\nReplace the engine air filter and cabin air filter as recommended in your car\u2019s manual, usually once per year.\n\nShop at your local AutoZone for your engine oil and filter, and any other fluids or parts you need to service your vehicle. You\u2019ll find top products and brands as well as helpful advice in-store and online.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Replace a Fuel Injector",
        "content": "Understanding Fuel Injectors\n\nFuel injectors are designed to deliver fuel into the engine\u2019s cylinders at the precise moment and in the correct quantity, ensuring optimal combustion. They\u2019re essentially a small electric valve fitted between the fuel rail and the intake manifold, combustion chamber, or on older cars, the throttle body. When the engine control unit (ECU) sends a signal, the injector\u2019s solenoid activates, pulling a plunger back and allowing fuel to flow through the injector nozzle and into the engine\u2019s intake manifold or directly into the cylinder.\nFuel injectors are engineered with precision to withstand high pressure and temperature. The design ensures that the fuel is atomized into tiny droplets for efficient burning. A fine spray pattern is crucial for achieving complete combustion, reducing emissions, and improving fuel efficiency.\n\nWhen to Replace a Fuel Injector\n\nSome fuel injectors will last the vehicle\u2019s complete lifetime, but as an electrical part that\u2019s involved in a high-heat environment and exposed to contaminants in the fuel, there\u2019s always potential for a failure, especially if they aren\u2019t maintained.\nThe first reason to replace a fuel injector is for an external leak. Although uncommon, any raw fuel that leaks from a fuel injector is a fire hazard, and that injector should be immediately replaced.\nIf a fuel injector becomes clogged from debris in the fuel or carbon deposits on the nozzle can\u2019t be cleaned, changing it is necessary. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be plagued with issues like a rough idle, misfire, poor fuel efficiency, and even trouble starting the engine. Of course, you can expect a Check Engine light on as well.\nShould you notice a raw fuel smell in the engine oil, it can be due to a fuel injector that\u2019s stuck partially open or weak, and the fuel is washing down into the crankcase.\nLastly, if you have your fuel injectors cleaned and tested out of the vehicle and they don\u2019t pass the test, replacing the fuel injectors is required.\n\nPreparing for the Replacement\n\nSince fuel is flammable, it\u2019s crucial to take great care when you\u2019re working on the fuel injection system.\n\nBefore anything, disconnect the battery, and it\u2019s best to let the engine cool completely.\nWear safety glasses and gloves, and avoid getting fuel on your skin.\nHave a fire extinguisher within reach whenever working on the fuel system.\nRelieve the fuel pressure prior to removing any components to prevent unexpected fuel spray. You can either press a valve on the fuel line to relieve the pressure, or pull the fuel pump relay and crank the engine for a few seconds.\nWork in a clean area to prevent dirt and debris from contaminating your new fuel injector and fuel system.\n\nStep-by-Step Fuel Injector Replacement\n\nBefore starting the job, check your vehicle\u2019s manual for the specific instructions on how to change fuel injectors and any parts that require removal beforehand.\n\nStep 1: Access the Fuel Injectors\n\nThere are several parts that interfere with injector removal that need to be moved or taken off first. It can include the air filter box, intake plenum, engine covers, wiring harnesses, and more. Your vehicle manual will be invaluable at this stage.\n\nStep 2: Detach the Fuel Rail and Remove Injectors\n\nNext, disconnect the fuel rail if required, or unfasten it and move it if that\u2019s possible. Injectors have a seal that\u2019s a snug fit into the fuel rail, so they may come out with the rail, or the fuel rail may need to be wiggled free from the injectors. Gently wiggle and pull the affected injector out of its mounting location.\n\nStep 3: Inspect and Clean\n\nCheck the injector ports for debris and clean if required. This helps the new injector seal properly and avoids introducing dirt and debris into the engine.\n\nStep 4: Install New Injectors\n\nApply some clean engine oil to lubricate the new fuel injector o-rings, then install them. Attach the fuel rail afterward.\n\nStep 5: Reassemble\n\nRe-install and connect any electrical items or parts that you removed during disassembly, ensuring each part is fully seated and secured.\n\nPost-Replacement Checks and Tips\n\nAfter you\u2019ve installed new fuel injectors, run the engine and inspect for leaks from the fuel system. If the car doesn\u2019t start right away, allow it to crank for a few seconds to pressurize the system, and check that any fuses and relays are installed and working.\nIf you\u2019re still experiencing the same symptoms, it\u2019s a good idea to have a professional mechanic take a look and diagnose it.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Is a Fuel Injector?",
        "content": "Introduction to Fuel Injectors\n\nFuel injectors are responsible for delivering the right amount of fuel to the engine, at the right time, and in a precise pattern. They form a critical part of the fuel delivery system in an engine, ensuring that the combustion chamber has the correct air-fuel mixture necessary for the internal combustion engine to work.\nUnlike carburetors, which use a venturi to suck fuel into the engine\u2019s passages, modern cars have fuel injectors that offer more control and precision. By using electronic controls, they can optimize the fuel-air mixture for a variety of conditions, from idling at a traffic light to cruising at highway speeds.\nFuel injectors are strategically located to ensure precise fuel delivery. In a traditional engine, they\u2019re usually mounted on the intake manifold near the intake valve. This positioning allows for an even dispersion of fuel before it comes into contact with the air in the combustion chamber.\nIn more modern high-performance vehicles, direct fuel injectors are located in the cylinder head, close to where the combustion takes place. This strategy, known as direct injection, allows more precise control over the fuel delivery, yielding better fuel economy and performance.\n\nHow Fuel Injectors Work\n\nThe system starts by delivering fuel from the car\u2019s fuel tank to the engine. Once it arrives at the fuel injectors, they deliver precise amounts of fuel into the combustion chamber, atomized and mixed with air to form a highly combustible air-fuel mixture.\nThe amount of fuel and the timing of its delivery is controlled by the Engine Control Unit. It uses sensors to monitor various operational parameters, like engine speed, throttle position, and air intake, adjusting the fuel injectors\u2019 output accordingly.\nWhen the ECU determines it\u2019s time to inject fuel, it sends an electrical pulse to the fuel injector, which momentarily opens a valve, allowing pressurized fuel to be released into the intake port or directly into the combustion chamber.\nThe fuel injection system is significantly more precise than traditional carbureted systems. With better control over the fuel delivery, you experience not only more efficient combustion but also a fewer harmful emissions. It also ensures a quicker response to changes in the engine\u2019s workload.\n\nMaintaining and Cleaning Fuel Injectors\n\nMaintaining your fuel injectors keeps your engine running more efficiently and problem-free. Over time, contaminants from fuel or other sources can clog the tiny openings of fuel injectors, affecting their ability to spray fuel evenly in a fine mist.\nRegular maintenance includes inspecting, cleaning, and if necessary, replacing your fuel injectors. It can improve fuel economy, performance, and can even prevent more significant, costly damage to your engine.\n\nDIY Cleaning vs. Professional Services\n\nFor those willing to get their hands dirty, DIY cleaning is an option. There are many fuel injector cleaning kits available that connect to the fuel rail and use a pressurized canister combined with a cleaning solution. It\u2019s a straightforward process, but it\u2019s important to follow the instructions carefully to avoid any damage. There are also fuel system cleaners that are added to a tank of fuel and remove contaminants as you drive.\nHowever, for a more thorough cleaning, a professional service may be the best course of action. A mechanic can perform a fuel injection cleaning service where the injectors are removed and cleaned individually, ensuring each injector is free from any blockages or build-up.\nBy keeping your injectors clean and in good working condition, you can avoid the most common issues related to fuel supply and achieve a more reliable vehicle. Whether you choose a DIY approach or seek professional services, always remember to follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations and use high-quality products when maintaining your fuel injectors.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "The Symptoms of Bad Fuel Injectors and What to Do About It",
        "content": "Common Symptoms of a Bad Fuel Injector\n\nEach fuel injector acts like a small, electronically controlled valve. Pressurized fuel at the fuel rail is allowed to pass through the injector into the combustion chamber at precisely timed intervals. At rest, a spring holds a plunger closed, sealing the fuel injector. When it\u2019s energized, an electromagnet pulls the plunger back, and pressurized fuel flows through the injector and through a fine screen that atomizes it into a predetermined pattern. Then, when the power to the injector is removed, the plunger closes again.\nIf you have bad fuel injectors, symptoms will eventually appear, and it often doesn\u2019t take very long. They can include:\n\nAn engine misfire. If the air-fuel ratio is incorrect due to an injector problem, it may not burn thoroughly. The Check Engine light can come on with misfire codes related to the affected cylinder.\nPoor fuel economy. If the fuel injector gets stuck open, it could dump excessive amounts of fuel into the cylinder. Or, fuel economy can decrease simply because the engine is compensating for a poorly operating cylinder.\nEngine hesitation or stumble. With a cylinder starved of fuel, it won\u2019t generate power. That can cause a stumbling or uneven running condition, and the RPMs can fluctuate.\nA rough idle. Especially when not under throttle, one or more cylinders that aren\u2019t producing power normally can make it feel like the engine is going to stall.\nEngine surge during acceleration. Inconsistent injector performance can cause an occasional surge since fuel might be sprayed properly one moment and too much or too little the next.\n\nThese symptoms can be caused by a range of issues. It could be a damaged plunger or poor electrical connection, carbon blockage on the orifice, wear on the needle, or buildup within the injector from contaminants in the fuel.\n\nDiagnosing a Bad Fuel Injector\n\nDiagnosing a bad fuel injector early is important because it can help prevent further damage to your engine. A faulty fuel injector can cause poor performance, decreased mileage, and an increase in emissions from your vehicle. It can even lead to engine failure if not addressed promptly since running lean can burn out a piston. Early diagnosis can also save you time and money by preventing the need for more extensive repairs in the future.\nTo diagnose a bad fuel injector, you should first confirm that one or more common signs of a faulty fuel injector are present such as misfires, engine stumbling, and a decrease in fuel mileage. You can then use an oscilloscope to measure the electrical pulses sent to the injector. This will tell you if there is an issue with the voltage or timing of when it is being triggered.\nFinally, a spray pattern test can check for problems with how the fuel is being delivered into the engine cylinders. This type of test is best performed by a professional shop that can accurately apply the signal to the injectors, then watch them spray and verify the volume of fuel they output.\n\nPreventing Fuel Injector Problems\n\nSome issues are inevitable, but most of the time, fuel injector problems can be mitigated or prevented altogether. To prevent fuel injector problems, it is important to keep up with regular maintenance on your vehicle.\nCheck the air filter regularly and replace it if dirty or clogged. Dirty carried into the engine in the air can contaminate the injectors. Fuel injectors should also be cleaned periodically, as dirt and debris that enters through the fuel can cause blockages or other issues with their performance.\n\u00a0Finally, use good-quality gas. It can help prevent the buildup of deposits inside the fuel system since it contains fewer contaminants in the first place.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How To Clean Fuel Injectors",
        "content": "Understanding Fuel Injectors\n\nInternal combustion engines need a precise mixture of fuel and air to function. Fuel injectors deliver fuel to your car\u2019s combustion chamber. That is, they spray just enough fuel into the chamber for your engine to burn effectively. If an injector supplies too much or too little, it won\u2019t run well or it won\u2019t run at all. While there are a few reasons air-fuel mixture may be rich, clogged fuel injectors often cause lean mixtures.\nTo remove carbon and other types of buildup from your vehicle\u2019s fuel injectors, you must use a high-quality injector cleaner. There are hundreds of cleaners on the market today. While there is a difference in fuel system cleaners, any cleaner that you use at 100% strength is apt to do a good job. Said another way, the cleaner you choose probably depends on both personal preference and brand loyalty.\n\nIdentifying Clogged Fuel Injectors\n\nClogged fuel injectors are likely to make your vehicle\u2019s engine idle roughly or stall altogether. If carbon accumulates on the diffusing tip of your car\u2019s fuel injectors, you may also burn more gas and get worse fuel economy. Fortunately, before you get to either point, your vehicle\u2019s Check Engine Light will probably turn on. \nAs you probably know, fuel has detergent additives in it that attempt to prevent fuel injectors from clogging. Still, these do not always do the trick. On the contrary, gunk in the fuel supply may eventually cause a clog. Alternatively, rust from your vehicle\u2019s gas tank or a bad fuel filter may contribute to clogged fuel injectors. Either way, you must know how to clean fuel injectors to keep your vehicle running optimally.\n\nCleaning Fuel Injectors With Removal\n\nArguably, the best way to clean fuel injectors is to remove them from your vehicle\u2019s engine. This, of course, allows you to thoroughly remove gunk. Even though there are a few steps involved in this type of cleaning, the effort is usually worthwhile, especially if the fuel injectors haven\u2019t been cleaned in years.\n\nFirst, remove the fuel injectors from your vehicle\u2019s engine. Since each engine is different, The amount of disassembly will vary significantly. You\u2019ll need to disconnect the fuel supply and remove the fuel rails, in most cases. Fortunately, your vehicle\u2019s service manual likely provides in-depth instructions on the process. If not, consult an aftermarket maintenance manual.\n\nNext, remove the rubber o-ring from the fuel rail side of the injector. Generally, you cannot reuse fuel injector rings, so be sure you buy replacements before beginning the project. After you have removed the fuel injectors and the o-rings, attach a rubber hose to the opening using hose clamps. This ensures no cleaner spills during the cleaning process.\n\nYou need some electricity to effectively clean fuel injectors. Therefore, you must connect one side of an electrical lead to the injectors. The other side, you connect to the positive terminal of your vehicle\u2019s battery. Only connect this lead, though, when you are ready for a spark.\n\nTo ensure you completely clean your fuel injectors, disconnect the rubber hose from the rail side and attach it to the outflow side. Then, allow the cleaner to flow through the injectors the opposite way. This is likely to remove any deposits or buildup that your rail-side cleaning missed.\n\nFinally, attach a new o-ring and re-insert the fuel injector.\n\nAfter you have cleaned one injector, you are ready to move onto the others.\n\nCleaning Fuel Injectors Without Removal\n\nIf you want to know how to clean fuel injectors without removal from the engine, you have some options. You may use a gasoline additive that cleans fuel injectors. The problem with this approach, though, is twofold. First, these cleaners dilute into a full tank of gas, weakening their potency and effectiveness. Secondly, they also only flow through injectors in one direction, making them less effective at removing carbon and other types of buildup.\nA better approach is to invest in a fuel injector cleaning kit. These kits come with a canister that holds cleaner and a hose that attaches to your vehicle\u2019s fuel injectors. While the design of these kits varies, most have a lid that screws off the canister. After unscrewing the lid, pour fuel injector cleaner into the container. Next, hang the canister on the underside of the hood to ensure you have a steady flow of cleaner into your vehicle\u2019s fuel injectors.\nThen, screw the hose end onto the vehicle\u2019s fuel rail at the test port. To locate the fuel rail, find the fuel injectors under your hood or read through your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. If these approaches do not do the trick, a quick online search can help you locate the fuel rail.\nNext, you need to turn the fuel pump off. To do so, remove the fuse that controls it from the fuse box. This disables the fuel pump, allowing gravity to pull cleaner from the canister into the engine. If your cleaner kit operates on air power instead of gravity, you also must hook the kit up to an air supply, such as a compressor. Then, you must turn the pressure gauge to the correct setting, usually about 50 PSI.\nFinally, start the vehicle\u2019s engine. Note, though, after attaching the cleaning kit and removing the fuel pump fuse, the car may be a bit tough to start. When all the cleaner empties from the canister, you have successfully cleaned your car\u2019s fuel injectors without removing them. Of course, you must remove the cleaning kit and re-insert the fuel pump fuse to finish the process.\nAs you may suspect, different cleaning kits may vary in their functionality. While these instructions should give you a general idea of how these kits work, you should read through the manufacturer\u2019s instructions completely to be sure you do the job correctly.\n\nHelpful Resources for Fuel Injectors\n\nKeeping Your Vehicle Running Optimally\n\nWhether you need to know how to clean fuel injectors by removing them or want to do the job without tearing apart your vehicle\u2019s engine, having clean injectors is an effective way to keep your vehicle running right. However you choose to tackle the project, it is worth your time and effort.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "Carburetor vs Fuel Injection: Which Option is Better Today?",
        "content": "How do carburetors work?\n\nCarburetors are devices that mechanically meter the amount of fuel and air that enter the engine. It works on what\u2019s known as Bernoulli\u2019s Principle that infers that liquids will always move from a high-pressure area to a lower-pressure area. As the throttle is pressed, a rod or cable to the carburetor opens a throttle valve below a narrowing opening called a venturi. As air passes through the venturi, the pressure drops, and the lower pressure draws gas through a channel from a fuel intake at the venturi. Essentially, once the engine is running, it continuously sucks gas into it.\nThere have been various carburetor designs over the years to finetune the process or maximize on power or efficiency, but the concept is relatively unchanged. It\u2019s a fuel system that is often preferred for its simplicity for that reason. By the mid-1990s, another design had become commonplace, all but eliminating carburetion from new vehicles in the auto industry.\n\nHow does a fuel injection system work?\n\nThe system that overtook carburetor engines was fuel injection. Initially developed as early as the 1880s, it wasn\u2019t feasible to implement until it could be controlled more reliably, and that occurred in the 1950s. Adoption was rather slow, though, and it wasn\u2019t until the nineties that it became the most popular method.\nFuel injectors are, at the most basic level, valves that control the flow of fuel into the engine. At first, a fuel injected carburetor, also known as an EFI carburetor, was used so a more accurate air-fuel mixture could be implemented, catering to emissions standards. Then, multi-port fuel injection took over, employing a fuel injector for each cylinder where atomized fuel sprayed directly at the intake valve. Air then moved separately to the intake where it would mix with the misted fuel.\nFuel injection systems are computer controlled. It depends on \u201cseeing\u201d an accurate volume of air entering the engine as well as the precise timing in the engine when the air-fuel mixture will ignite. The amount of fuel to pass through the valve is determined by the length of time the injector is open, known as the pulse width. It\u2019s a variable controlled by an engine management system, whether it\u2019s known as an engine control unit (ECU), a powertrain control module (PCM), or otherwise.\n\nPros and cons for both carburetion and fuel injection\n\nAs with anything, there are benefits and concerns with both carbureted systems as well as fuel injection. Whether you\u2019re looking to upgrade a classic or muscle car or simply decide on what type of vehicle to purchase, here\u2019s what you should consider.\n\nPros of carburetion\n\nCarburetors are comparatively simple in design.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s possible to manually tune and adjust a carburetor.\nDiagnosis is straightforward for fuel system concerns.\nFor a classic car, carburetion allows for owners to work on their own vehicles.\nChanging a carb can easily enhance performance without other requirements.\n\nCons of a carbureted system\n\nIf the climate or elevation changes, carburetors don\u2019t adjust autonomously.\nCarbs are dependable but not extremely precise in air-fuel delivery.\nThey require service and repair at regular intervals.\nCarburetors can\u2019t typically meet modern fuel efficiency or emissions standards.\n\nPros of fuel injection\n\nFuel injection systems don\u2019t require adjustments since they\u2019re computer controlled.\nThey are designed to meet or exceed emissions regulations.\nFuel delivery is extremely accurate, even accounting for elevation and temperature changes.\nThey can deliver more power with less fuel consumption in many circumstances.\nEngine start-ups are simpler and more reliable.\n\nCons of a fuel injection system\n\nA fuel injection system is much more complex and requires a professional to diagnose problems.\u00a0\nFactory-equipped systems cannot be adjusted to improve performance or efficiency.\nGenerally, it\u2019s a more expensive system to install than a carburetor.\nInjectors are finicky with contaminants and require servicing and cleaning occasionally.\n\nWhat should you choose?\n\nWhich is better: carb or fuel injection? That\u2019s a tough question to answer without context. For someone working on a classic car or performing a restoration, a carb is still preferred in most cases due to its simplicity. There\u2019s no need for computers or programming, and a screwdriver is all it takes to tune up. But fuel injection systems are often available as an upgrade that can help you get the most power from your engine, plus enhanced reliability is a great side effect. Fuel injection comes at a premium cost.\nIf you\u2019re purchasing a vehicle, odds are you won\u2019t come across anything from the past 25 years that is equipped with a carburetor anymore. It\u2019ll be equipped with fuel injection, and there\u2019s no easy way \u2013 or reason to \u2013 retrofit a carb onto the engine.",

        "title": "The Symptoms of a Bad Fuel Pump\u00a0",
        "content": "What is a fuel pump and how does it work?\n\nA fuel pump is a small electric motor that transfers fuel from the tank to the engine. In older vehicles, the fuel pump is mounted along the frame rail, fastened into the fuel line. Classic cars often use a mechanical fuel pump at the engine that pulls fuel to the front of the car rather than a pump at the back, pushing it forward.\u00a0\u00a0\nModern cars almost all have the fuel pump inside the fuel tank. The small cylindrical pump is part of a larger assembly that includes a fuel level sensor and a fuel filter screen. Generally, pumps can produce more pressure by pushing fluid through the line rather than drawing it up.\u00a0\u00a0\nA fuel pump for today\u2019s engines usually uses an impeller-style system that pulls fuel through it, creating positive pressure on the engine side of the pump. Other styles including a rotary vane and gerotor pump are available for select models, but they\u2019re far less common.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce the pump has built pressure, it\u2019s intended to hold it by preventing fuel from bleeding back into the tank. In this way, there\u2019s always fuel in the line, primed, so you can start your engine quickly whenever you need to.\u00a0\n\nHow long does a fuel pump last?\u00a0\n\nThe strict tolerances in manufacturing for fuel pumps means that they last much longer than they used to. It\u2019s no longer uncommon for a fuel pump to last ten years or longer, and 100,000 miles is well within normal. But that\u2019s not a guarantee since fuel pumps can fail from overheating or sitting with bad gas in them too long, or in the rare occurrence of a manufacturer\u2019s defect. And if it goes bad, you\u2019ll need to deal with it right away.\u00a0\n\nSigns Your Fuel Pump is Going Bad\n\nTrying to figure out how to tell if a fuel pump is bad has a few tricks. The common signs of a bad fuel pump include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhining noise coming from the fuel tank area when the engine is running.\u00a0\nStalling that will restart after several minutes.\u00a0\nTrouble starting the car.\u00a0\nLack of power.\u00a0\nLong cranking time.\u00a0\n\nWhining Noise\n\nA whining noise from the tank often is a precursor to loss of pressure or total failure. It can sometimes last with a bad fuel pump sounds for hours, weeks, or indefinitely. If the pump is whining, keep a close eye on it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCar is Stalling\n\nIf your car is stalling and it will restart after sitting for a bit, the fuel pump may be overheating. The cause is often from being operated with low fuel in the tank frequently, since the gas actually cools the pump too. Odds are that it will completely fail soon.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDifficult to Start Your Car\n\nDifficulty starting the car can be an indication that the pump has quit altogether or has extremely low pressure, and lack of power when you\u2019re driving is also a symptom of bad fuel pump that goes hand in hand.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLong Cranking Time\n\nLong cranking time usually indicates that a fuel pump won\u2019t hold positive pressure in the fuel line with the engine off. The fuel has bled back to the tank, and cycling the key is necessary to re-prime the line before the car will fire up.\u00a0\n\nHow to test your fuel pump\u00a0\n\nTesting a fuel pump can be deceiving. One of the issues is that it can cut out intermittently, or it might just be completely dead. There are a few things to check if your car won\u2019t start or run well.\u00a0\u00a0\nCheck the fuse and fuel pump relay on the fuel pump circuit. A blown fuse or signs of a bad fuel pump relay usually indicates that the pump is drawing too much power, especially if it happens more than once.\u00a0\n\nTips for replacing your fuel pump\u00a0\n\nEach model has unique needs to replace a fuel pump although the general process may be similar. Start with disconnecting the battery as a spark near an open fuel source is never a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0\nSince almost all fuel pumps are inside the tank, you\u2019ll need to access the top of the tank. In some cases, that can mean lifting the vehicle and lowering the fuel tank, but some cars have access ports under the rear seat or in the trunk compartment, so always check the procedure beforehand.\u00a0\u00a0\nClean the dirt and debris from the top of the fuel tank before opening it, preventing loose dirt from falling into clean fuel. Disconnect and label the wires and hoses to ensure they go back in exactly the same way on the new pump.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen the repair is complete, cycle the key a few times to prime the fuel line before you crank the engine over. That will purge air from the fuel line for a faster start-up.\u00a0\n\nSummary\u00a0\n\nYour fuel pump should last for several years, and possibly even your vehicle\u2019s whole lifespan. But if you\u2019re experiencing problems with starting, reliability, or performance, it might be time to diagnose and replace the fuel pump.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf that\u2019s the case, get your fuel pump replacement at AutoZone. With an excellent selection of parts from top manufacturers for virtually any year, make, and model, you\u2019ll find exactly what you need.",

        "title": "What Is an Electronic Throttle Body?",
        "content": "What Does an Electronic\u00a0Throttle Body Do?\n\nLocated between the intake manifold and the intake assembly, the throttle body controls how much air your vehicle\u2019s engine receives based on how far you press the gas pedal. Generally, more airflow means more power. With an ETB, a small electric motor opens and closes the throttle body plate. As you may suspect, a computer controls the ETB. Depending on which vehicle you drive, this computer may either be the engine or powertrain control module, or a dedicated ETB module.\n\nEngine control modules (ECM) are computers that control the engine\nPowertrain control modules (PCM) control both the engine and the transmission\nETB modules control the electronic throttle body\n\nIn drive-by-wire vehicles that do not have a ETB module, the electronic throttle body is controlled by either the ECM or PCM.\nVehicles made after the mid-2000s tend to have ETBs. Those that do typically have lower emissions and better fuel economy.\n\nHow Does an Electronic\u00a0Throttle Body Work?\n\nMost ETBs are simple devices that have four primary parts:\n\nA control module that serves as the nerve center for the ETB\nA motor that powers the mechanism\nA valve that opens and closes\nAn accelerator pedal module that includes sensors\n\nTo function, the ETB requires information from a variety of systems. Your vehicle\u2019s cruise control, accelerator, engine speed sensor, mass airflow sensor, and speed sensor communicate information to its engine control module. The module then determines how much to open the ETB\u2019s valve. This, in turn, regulates how much air and fuel your vehicle\u2019s engine receives. ETB\u2019s are crucial with today\u2019s technology of vehicles with adaptive cruise control, and other luxuries and safety features that allow the vehicles computer system to adapt to different driving conditions and situations.\n\nBenefits of an\u00a0ETB\n\nModern technology is not always better than its predecessors. Still, there are a number of advantages to driving a car with drive-by-wire technology:\n\nLess weight.\u00a0Mechanical devices often weigh more than their electronic counterparts. This is generally true with ETBs. Because lighter cars usually use less fuel, you may achieve better fuel economy with a car that has an ETB over one with a manual throttle body\nReliability.\u00a0Mechanical components have moving parts that may wear out over time. With an ETB, you are apt to worry less about having an important component degrade or break completely\nSmoothness.\u00a0ETBs often contribute to overall ride quality. That is, when you accelerate, your vehicle\u2019s engine and transmission work together. The process, though, can be a bit choppy. The ETB helps smooth out your ride\n\nDrawbacks of an\u00a0ETB\n\nEven though ETBs have a variety of benefits, they also have drawbacks:\n\nCorrosion.\u00a0Some styles of ETBs have a potentiometer design. To function, these ETBs use a brush-and-rotor system that may corrode over time. Further, dirt, dust, and other debris may work its way into your vehicle\u2019s ETB, causing a variety of performance issues\nFailure.\u00a0Other types of ETBs have Hall-effect sensors. While these ETBs generally do not corrode, they are also not invincible. If your Hall-effect ETB is about to fail, you may not receive a warning. Instead of causing performance problems, these ETBs often simply quit\nMaintenance.\u00a0Like with many other electronic components, ETBs are typically more difficult to maintain. If you want to service your vehicle\u2019s ETB, you may need professional assistance. You may also have to flash reset your vehicle\u2019s control module\nDiagnostics.\u00a0Finally, diagnosing problems with an ETB may be more challenging than troubleshooting manual systems. That is, several trouble codes may implicate the ETB. Tracking down the source of the problem may require both time and patience\n\nYou may remember that some Toyota vehicles had problems with ETBs in the past. In some models, a faulty ETB led to uncontrollable acceleration. Fortunately, this problem seems to have resolved in recent years. In fact, there have been virtually no reports in the last few years of unchecked acceleration due to bad ETBs in Toyotas or other types of vehicles.\n\nWarning\u00a0Signs\n\nGenerally, before your electronic throttle body fails completely, your vehicle will warn you of problems with the mechanism. Here are five warning signs your ETB may require some work:\n\n1. Check Engine Light is On\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s control module keeps tabs on its ETB. If there is a problem with its functionality or performance, you are apt to see a light appear on your dashboard.  \n\n2. Engine Does Not Idle Correctly\n\nBecause the air entering your vehicle\u2019s engine plays an important role in idling, your car may begin to run roughly. Alternatively, your engine\u2019s normal idle speed may increase.  \n\n3. Car Stalls\n\nIf your vehicle\u2019s engine does not have the correct amount of air flowing into it, your car may stall, or its engine may die.  \n\n4. Car Loses Power\n\nInternal combustion engines require a steady supply of both air and fuel to operate normally. If your ETB is not supplying adequate air, your car may lose power. You may also notice a decrease in fuel economy. \n\n5. Car Goes into Limp Mode\n\nMany modern vehicles have a failsafe called limp mode. To protect the engine from damage, these vehicles reduce power, allowing you to drive home at a slow speed. A bad ETB can encourage your car to go into limp mode.  \n\nRoutine\u00a0Maintenance\n\nWith time, carbon and other contaminants may begin to accumulate inside your vehicle\u2019s ETB. While most vehicle manufacturers do not include routine ETB maintenance in their service schedules, having your system cleaned periodically may be a smart idea. Note, though, that some vehicles must relearn idle speed after an ETB cleaning.",

        "title": "How Much Does Replacing a Fuel Pump Cost?",
        "content": "In diesel engines, fuel is delivered via a \u201clift\u201d pump, which brings fuel from the fuel tank to the diesel injection pump, which turns the lower-pressure delivery of the fuel into extremely high pressure for a diesel injector. Most lift pumps today are electrical, although a few mechanical pumps still exist. \nAn electric fuel is in a vast majority of the cars that are on the road today. This kind of pump turns on when you put your key in the ignition and turn to run/start. Usually, if functioning well, it sounds like a soft hum in the background of your car.\nIf there are any problems with your fuel pump, this becomes evident very quickly. Having a bad fuel pump can leave you stranded, so it is important to recognize the signs of a bad fuel pump and understand how much it costs to replace it.\nBad Fuel Pump Symptoms\nOne of the first things you might notice with a bad fuel pump is that your car sounds different when it is on. A well-functioning fuel pump generally gives off a soft humming noise when your vehicle starts up. If instead you hear a sharp whining sound from your fuel tank, then this is very likely a sign you need a new fuel pump. The first thing you should do if you hear this noise is ensure that you are not running below empty.\nA second consequence of a bad fuel pump is that your car might have a difficult time starting. One of the fuel pump\u2019s primary jobs is to keep a level of static pressure within the fuel system. This way upon startup, the pump does not need to completely re-prime the entire system again. As your fuel pump ages, it can lose the ability to keep this static pressure, causing you to have to crank your car for a considerable amount of time before\u00a0start\u00a0up.\nA weak fuel pump is one that will often not hold sufficient pressure for the fuel injection system to operate properly. In many cases, it can start the vehicle, but acceleration can be a problem with hesitation, lack of power, or stalling. In any of these cases, a running and/or static fuel pressure test can help determine if the fuel pump is the culprit. Keep in a mind, a clogged fuel filter can exhibit some of the same \u201cweak fuel pump\u201d symptoms, so changing the fuel filter is always the first step.\u00a0\n\nIn modern vehicle fuel pumps, the pump assembly usually contains the fuel-level sending unit as well, so if your fuel gauge is not properly working, you can often trace it to a fuel pump assembly unit not functioning properly. In both cases, changing the fuel pump can rectify the issue.\nFinally, you may not be able to get your car to start at all. Unfortunately, many pumps do not give any warning sign of their failure.\u00a0Sometimes, a pump can die while the vehicle is on the road, and other times, the vehicle shuts off, the pump seizes, and never starts again. \nMost cars have a prime cycle that the fuel pump will go through when the key is turned to on, but not start. This prime lasts usually about 3-5 seconds where you will hear the pump turn on in the tank. If you don\u2019t hear this at the tank and have before while the car was operating properly, the fuel pump is suspect.\nFuel Pump Replacement Cost\nThe actual cost of replacing a fuel pump depends on several factors. The parts cost of a fuel pump is usually between $75 and $250, depending on the vehicle. If you are replacing the fuel pump yourself, beyond this it is just the cost of your time. Generally speaking, replacing a fuel pump is considered an intermediate-level task.\nIf you decide to go with a professional, you may be looking at a cost of between $400 and $600 to replace a bad fuel pump. You can search through our\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0in your area for a mechanic that can help with the fuel pump repair. Expect the actual replacement to take between 1 to 6 hours, depending on the expertise of the mechanic and the tools they happen to have on hand.\nWhether you do the job yourself or have a professional do it, make sure that the fuel tank is properly cleaned of all contaminants, as years of fuel sediment can build up in the bottom of the fuel tank.\u00a0Remember that AutoZone has all the parts and tools to tackle the job should you choose to do it on your own!",

        "title": "How a Car's Fuel System Works",
        "content": "How Fuel Moves Through a Car\n\n1. It Starts with the Fuel Pump\n\nIf you want to be technical, it starts at the tank when you remove the gas cap and pump fuel in. From here, both gasoline and diesel fuel are picked up by the fuel pump, where the real action begins.\nThe vast majority of vehicles today have a fuel pump that resides in the fuel tank itself. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s located on the frame or subframe, which is far less common. On a standard electronic fuel injected vehicle, which still makes up a vast majority of vehicles on the road, this pump then provides the volume, and pressure of the fuel. Older, carbureted vehicles generally have a suction-style fuel pump that is mounted to the engine, and draws the fuel out of the tank, into the pump, and pressurizes it on its way to the carburetor.\nThe newest technology for gasoline engines is direct injection, which requires in most cases 2 fuel pumps \u2013 a \u201clift\u201d or \u201ctransfer\u201d pump which pumps fuel up and out of the fuel tank, and then a pressure pump, usually mounted on the frame or subframe of the vehicle, which then provides fuel to the injectors at high pressure. This is very similar to how a Diesel engine works, where the lift pump in the tank supplies fuel usually to a mechanical, high pressure pump mounted on the engine.\n\n2. It travels through Fuel Lines and Filters\n\nIf the fuel pump does what\u2019s expected of it and draws the fuel from the tank, this fuel first has to travel through metal or plastic fuel lines, which run from the tank to the engine. The fuel filter then actively filters this fuel to remove micro-debris, whether it\u2019s fasoline or diesel.\n\n3. The Fuel Pressure Regulator\n\nAll fuel systems have an optimum pressure they have to run at. On older carbureted engines, this pressure is low \u2013 between 3-5PSI. On multi-port Electronic Fuel injection systems, it\u2019s much higher \u2013 usually between 50-90PSI. Each system will have a regulator that takes the fuel pressure from the pump, and regulates it to the proper volume, and pressure. While fuel pressure regulators don\u2019t commonly fail, they can, and when they do, issues with performance or no-start/no-run situations can happen. On most Diesel engines, the injection pump, or pressure pump, also controls the pressure.\n\n4. Next Stop, the Engine\n\nAfter the filter has removed any contaminants and the pressure regulated properly, it is time for the fuel to go to the engine where it can finally be of use. There are a few different ways the fuel can go into the engine. Which way your car does it is likely a matter of when your car was built.\n\nCarburetors\u202fwere the norm of getting fuel to the engine for half a century. The carb had a float that would raise and lower to allow gas to enter the engine at different rates, depending on how open the float was.\nFuel injectors\u202fhandle supplying fuel to almost all modern engines. These devices can be either mechanical or electronic, whereas modern systems, either Direct-Injection or Multi-port/Sequential are all electronic. Electronic fuel injectors are controlled by the ECU, and can inject fuel with far greater precision than a purely mechanical carburetor because the ECU has total control.\n\nOnce the fuel is in the engine, it can be combusted and expelled through the vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. \n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

Some newer cars have \u201clifetime\u201d filters that may be built into the fuel pump and do not need to be replace on a service interval. Check your owner\u2019s manual to determine exactly how long the usefulness of your fuel filter lasts. If you end up with a tank of dirty fuel or start to notice symptoms that indicate the fuel you\u2019re using is no longer being filtered properly, you may have to switch it out sooner than expected.\n\nHow Long Does a Fuel Filter Last?\u00a0\n\nSome but not all cars have a fuel filter element that can be replaced. On gas-powered cars, it\u2019s usually underneath, clipped or bolted to the frame rail. On diesel vehicles, it\u2019s usually in the engine compartment and has the same style as an oil filter. For most cases, the fuel filter needs to be replaced every 20,000 to 30,000 miles, while diesel vehicles often are slightly shorter intervals. The best way to tell your vehicle\u2019s interval is to check the maintenance guide provided along with your owner\u2019s manual.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome vehicles don\u2019t have a replaceable fuel filter. Rather, they have a screen on the fuel pump that filters out particles in the tank, and these filters aren\u2019t serviced unless you\u2019re working on the fuel pump itself.\u00a0\n\nSigns of a Bad Fuel Filter\u00a0\n\nAs fuel flows through the filter, pleated material strains out any contaminants on the way to the engine. It could be dirt, salt, or any moisture or debris that gets kicked into the massive tank when the gas station gets a delivery. When the fuel filter gets full of this material, it restricts fuel flow to the engine. Symptoms are sure to result eventually.\n\nPower loss when under loadCheck engine lights is onEngine runs rough or stallsYour engine won\u2019t startFuel pump quitsDecreased fuel economy\n\nPower Loss When Under Load\nRestricted fuel supply to the engine might allow for proper fuel pressure while the engine is idling. However, when you\u2019re accelerating or pulling a load, the demand for fuel is much greater. A blocked fuel filter prevents the fuel rail from staying full of fuel, restricting the amount of power your engine can produce.\n\nCheck Engine Light is On\u00a0\n\nIf the injectors don\u2019t receive enough pressurized fuel, there may not be enough sprayed into the cylinders to be burned. A \u2018P0171 System Too Lean\u2019 code could be stored in the powertrain control module, triggering the Check Engine Light.\n\nEngine Runs Rough or Stalls\n\nWithout sufficient fuel supply, the engine can stumble or stall while driving or while idling. Think of it like pinching the straw while you try to drink your soda through it. When you close off the straw, you\u2019re unable to keep the flow of energy-producing fluid going.\n\nYour Engine Won\u2019t Start\n\nWhen you turn the key, the fuel pump pressurizes fuel going into the supply line. A clogged fuel filter may prevent fuel from pressurizing the same in the section between the filter and the engine. Your engine may not fire up since it\u2019s starved of fuel, or it might fire up for a second and die again.\n\nFuel Pump Quits\n\nExcessive demand for fuel can create strain on the fuel pump. It\u2019s constantly cycling at peak performance, trying to force fuel into a restricted supply line. It can cause the fuel pump relay to kick off, the fuse to burn, or the fuel pump to quit altogether.\n\nDecreased Fuel Economy\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but a blocked fuel filter can actually cause higher fuel consumption. The PCM believes that the air-fuel mixture is lean and, to compensate, commands more fuel to mix with the air being sucked into the engine to get the amount of power you\u2019re commanding from your car. Though it\u2019s not performing as well, you\u2019re burning more fuel than if the fuel was moving at the right volume.\n\nHow Do You Replace a Fuel Filter?\n\nIf you see signs you need to change your fuel filter, then it\u2019s probably time to start thinking about whether you can replace it yourself or if you need some professional help. While the exact process for changing the filter can vary a lot depending on your vehicle, it is possible to switch it out yourself.\u00a0\nRemember, that you are going to be dealing with gasoline, and leaking gasoline once you crack open the fuel line, so exercise extreme caution! Be sure to read your repair manual or consult online how to properly relieve the fuel system of pressure before cracking open the fuel line, or what steps need to be taken to open the fuel system.\u00a0\nThe most common location for a fuel filter is in one of the fuel lines coming from the fuel tank, mounted near the tank on the\u00a0vehicle\u2019s frame. Several are also located inside the engine compartment,\u00a0while others are non-serviceable and located within the fuel pump assembly, in the fuel tank.\u00a0\nMost fuel systems on cars built in the last 20 years have quick-connect clips or unions that hold the lines\u00a0together, and\u00a0hold the fuel filter in-line for a leak-free seal. With the right tools,\u00a0such as OEM 25150 or 24681,\u00a0you can disconnect these fittings. Keep in mind, they can often be tricky to disconnect. If you do not have a lot of experience with fuel system maintenance, it may be best to get help from a professional mechanic, which you can search your area for one of our\u00a0Preferred Shops here.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeep in mind, a fuel filter is made to be a service-interval part, rather than a failure part. Follow your vehicle\u2019s OEM guidelines (check the owner\u2019s manual) on when to change a fuel filter, or, if you\u2019ve purchased a vehicle with over 100,000 miles and no indication the fuel filter has been changed, it\u2019s a great idea to change it.\u00a0The good news is that fuel filters can be a relatively affordable part, especially if you buy the parts and do the work yourself. A new filter can cost as little as around fifteen dollars in some cases, and even if you go to a pro, the costs of a replacement generally stays around $200.\nHow to Check a Fuel Filter\n\nOnce you remove a fuel filter, you can tell whether it\u2019s the source of your problem\u00a0by a simple blow-test.\u00a0\nFirst, attempt to drain all the gas out of the fuel filter the best you can.\u00a0Find the inlet to the fuel filter (should be labeled as either \u201cin\u201d or have an arrow pointing to the direction of the fuel flow) and clean that inlet with a shop towel. \nNow, place a disposable rag or shop towel\u00a0on your workbench, and gently blow into the inlet of the fuel filter, aiming down towards your shop rag on the bench. You should be able to easily blow into the filter without much resistance. With a plugged fuel filter, you won\u2019t be able to. With a heavily restricted or clogged fuel filter, it will be hard. \nRemember, gasoline is gross, doesn\u2019t taste good, and is flammable, so be sure to exercise extreme caution. Leave any rags or towels long enough to dry outside before disposing them, and NEVER throw any old fuel or rags wet with gasoline into the trash.\nKeeping Up with Fuel Filter Maintenance\nFuel filter problems generally\u00a0won\u2019t happen with proper maintenance.\u00a0If you start noticing problems with your engine running strangely and experience loss of power and poor gas mileage,\u00a0the fuel filter is a likely suspect\u00a0on the fuel side, and an easy one to check off and change.\u00a0\nLuckily, a\u202fnew fuel filter\u202fshould not cause too much of a dent in your bank account\u00a0and\u00a0even if you find that it doesn\u2019t solve the issue, you are still replacing a maintenance item that needs to be replaced soon enough.\u00a0Following the recommended change intervals in your owner\u2019s manual is key to maintain optimal vehicle health,\u00a0and in this case, the health of your fuel system. Waiting until you are starting to experience issues with your fuel filter may cause bigger fuel delivery issues to deal with beyond a\u00a0clogged filter.",

        "content": "Please remember to keep proper safety precautions in mind when you are working with fuel. Remember that gas is a highly combustible substance and thus extra care must be taken. For instance, make sure that your workspace is well-ventilated and you should have a fire extinguisher on hand. Additionally, make sure that nobody is working with flame near your work space or smoking cigarettes. Finally, make sure to adhere to all proper fuel disposing ordinances in your city. Do not dispose of gasoline by pouring it into open sewers, and make sure that any gasoline-soaked rags are not thrown into general waste bins.\n\nHow to Properly Clean a Gas Tank\n\n1. Drain\n\nDrain fuel tank into an approved container.\n\n2. Clean Outside of Tank\n\nClean rust and debris from the top of the fuel tank.\n\n3. Remove Fuel Pump\n\nRemove the fuel pump from the tank.\n\n4. Swirl\n\nSwirl gas tank, pour out remaining gas and debris.\n\n5.

Check if Dry\n\nConfirm tank is completely dry (approx. 30 min).\n\n10. Refill\n\nRefill tank with fresh fuel.\n\nEnsure fresh fuel is used with the new fuel pump. This prevents contaminations from going back into the clean tank.\nManually cleaning out your gas tank shouldn\u2019t take you more than an afternoon once you get some practice under your belt. And an afternoon invested in your car is certainly worth it.\n\nWhy Should I Clean My Fuel Tank?\n\nDid you know that most\u00a0replacement fuel pump\u00a0failures are due to contamination from the fuel tank? Contaminants in the tank cause the strainer to clog, forcing the pump to pull more current and amperage resulting in a burnout, damaging the new fuel pump that was just replaced. Depending upon the amount of contaminants it is estimated that It can take up to three fuel pumps to clean the tank. Sometimes a dirty fuel tank might not cause the pump to fail, but dirty fuel tanks can also affect your gas mileage and clog your fuel filter.\nThe original pump went into a clean tank. To ensure the same level of performance, the new pump should go into a clean tank too.\nTo make the job easier, we carry\u00a0Delphi Technologies\u2019 fuel tank cleaning kit (FFC01)\u00a0designed to help your customer easily clean their fuel tank.

        "title": "How Fuel Injector Cleaner Works",
        "content": "What Does Fuel Cleaner Clean?\n\nMost modern vehicles use fuel injection, a system which uses precision injectors to supply enough gas for the ideal fuel/air ratio in an internal combustion engine. Any issues with a fuel injector can reduce the amount of fuel in the ratio and reduce the efficiency of your vehicle. Over time, a completely clogged fuel cleaner may prevent your vehicle from starting.\nBuildups of various contaminants can occur throughout your vehicle. From your fuel injectors and combustion chamber to your exhaust system, a buildup of by-products is difficult to remove and harmful to the overall fuel economy and performance of your vehicle.\n\nWhat Contaminants Build up in a Fuel System?\n\nNewer vehicles are designed to prevent buildup of contaminants from gasoline. Older vehicles are susceptible to buildup and clogs from two main contaminants: ethanol and carbon. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is an additive used in gasoline. Ethanol is derived from corn, so it\u2019s a renewable fuel source that can boost octane. Early introduction of ethanol was designed to reduce emissions and improve overall air quality, but modern engines no longer need this aspect of ethanol.\nInstead, ethanol is typically used as a cost-saving measure. The alcohol in ethanol is corrosive, so it can oxidize and emulsify into a by-product that isn\u2019t combustible. Over time, this buildup can clog your intake valves and fuel injectors.\nCarbon is another by-product of your engine\u2019s normal operations. Even more than ethanol, carbon deposits can reduce efficiency and clog up your system. Carbon is naturally found in gasoline, but your engine isn\u2019t able to burn 100% of the carbon while it\u2019s running. Most of these carbon deposits make their way out your exhaust system. Some, unfortunately, can remain in your fuel injection system and prevent proper fuel injection.\n\nHow Can You Tell Whether Your Fuel Injector Is Dirty?\n\nYour fuel injector doesn\u2019t necessarily get dirty so much as it can simply become clogged at some point. (No literal dirt or outside debris should be making its way into your engine.) Fuel contains various elements that can leave deposits behind as they pass through the parts of your engine. These deposits build up over time in your fuel system, eventually making it less efficient and affecting your car\u2019s overall performance as a result. How can you know for sure that you\u2019re dealing with a clogged fuel injector and not some other issue? Evaluate your vehicle for the following signs that it\u2019s time for a cleaning.\n\nYour engine has been misfiring, stuttering, lurching, or choking. When fuel injectors become clogged, their ability to properly mix the fuel with air can be affected.\nYour engine stalls or idles in a way that sounds or feels \u201crough\u201d. This is caused by low RPM due to a fuel supply that isn\u2019t flowing smoothly or efficiently.\nYour engine just plain hasn\u2019t been feeling as powerful as it normally does. Anything that gets in the way of proper combustion, up to and including clogged fuel injectors, can result in a noticeable loss of engine power.\nYour gas consumption is on the rise. This is also due to combustion issues that keep fuel from being utilized as well as it normally would be.\nYour vehicle has been failing emission tests. Uneven fuel combustion caused by clogged injectors can easily result in enough harmful emissions for a failing result.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of fuel injector cleaner? It removes the residue that\u2019s clogging up the works so that your car can get back to being reliable and running smoothly again. The more of the above signs you\u2019ve been noticing in your vehicle\u2019s performance lately, the more likely it is that your fuel injector could use a little attention. Keep in mind that this is something that\u2019s eventually necessary for\u202fevery\u202fvehicle, as all fuel injectors become clogged sooner or later.\n\nWhat Does Fuel Injector Cleaner Do?\n\nThe great majority of the cleaners on the market contain chemicals (like polybutene amine, or PBA, to name just one example) that are specially formulated to break down any deposit build-up.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that such cleaners work best when used regularly to not only break up existing deposits, but reduce the likelihood of new deposits forming. How often you should clean your own fuel injector depends on what you drive. Some manufacturers consider a cleaning every 30,000 miles or so to be adequate, but others may suggest one every 15,000 miles or thereabouts instead. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of what most products on the market do for your system:\n\nRid both the nozzles of your fuel injector and your engine\u2019s combustion chamber of troublesome carbon deposits.\nEnhances your vehicle\u2019s ability to burn fuel efficiently, meaning you\u2019ll likely get better gas mileage and enjoy a smoother overall driving experience.\nKeeps your entire fuel system adequately lubricated, minimizing friction and slowing the speed of future deposit buildup.\n\nAs with other parts of your regular vehicle maintenance routine, regularly cleaning your fuel injector will extend the life of your engine and ensure it runs better overall.\n\nHow Often Do Fuel Injectors Need to be Cleaned?\n\nSome individuals choose to use cleaning products with every tank of fuel, while others believe that fuel injection cleaning isn\u2019t necessary. If you\u2019re looking for a general time frame, a good place to start is using fuel system cleaner every 3,000 miles.\nOf course, many factors can affect this timeline. If you are planning on long-term storage for your vehicle, clean the fuel injection system first. A resting vehicle is more likely to experience carbon buildup and emulsifying ethanol.\nIf you drive an older vehicle, you may want to consider cleaning your fuel system more frequently. Older vehicles don\u2019t operate as efficiently and aren\u2019t designed to avoid ethanol buildup, so there\u2019s a greater risk of a clogged fuel system.\n\nHow to Use Fuel Cleaner?\n\nIf your engine is stuttering, vibrating, misfiring or your check engine light turns on, it may be time to use a fuel cleaner. So, how do you use fuel cleaner? Here are the basic steps to effectively using a fuel injector cleaner:\n\n1. Choose Your Cleaner\n\nPurchase your favorite brand of fuel cleaner. If you don\u2019t have a preferred brand, do some research on what cleaners are often used on your make and model of car.\n\n2. Start with an Empty Tank\n\nFor optimal use, be sure your fuel tank is near empty.\n\n3. Read the Instructions\n\nFollow the instructions that came with your fuel cleaning bottle. Add the correct amount of cleaner directly into your fuel tank. You can check your service manual to determine the size of your fuel tank.\n\n4. Top Off\n\nTop off your fuel tank and idle your vehicle briefly before driving as normal.\n\nThese steps generally apply to most fuel cleaner products, but be sure you follow any directions specific to your brand of cleaning product. If your engine is still experiencing stuttering and misfiring, take your vehicle to your local mechanic for a complete inspection. This may be a sign that part of your\u00a0fuel system\u00a0is damaged.\n\nWhat To Consider When\u00a0Choosing a Fuel Injector Cleaner\n\nNot all fuel injector cleaners are created equally. Some are going to be better fits for your needs than others, so it\u2019s important to know what each option brings to the table. Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind as you evaluate your options.\n\nSome products focus on cleaning buildup, while others are better for maintenance purposes. Many products do both. Always thoroughly read product packaging before buying to make sure it\u2019s the best fit for your purposes.\nBe realistic about what you can actually expect from a fuel injector cleaner. A very old vehicle that hasn\u2019t been maintained over the years or a lemon with an engine that\u2019s completely falling apart is likely beyond the help of even the best cleaner.\n\nAt the end of the day, keeping your fuel injectors clean, clear, and functioning properly is all about staying diligent about\u00a0ongoing maintenance. As with many potential engine problems, it\u2019s always much easier to simply stay on top of ongoing concerns than it is to try to reverse a huge problem later on. Your engine (and your wallet) will definitely thank you for it.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "What Fuel Stabilizer Is and How to Use It",
        "content": "What\u2019s the Big Deal with\u00a0Expired Gasoline?\n\nThe scary news is that expired gasoline can potentially ruin your engine entirely. If you leave fuel sitting in the tank unused for more than a couple of months, you are risking it compromising the internals of your fuel tank, which will cause you no end of problems the next time you try to fire up your machine.\nEven worse, if the gas sits in the car for more than 6 months, it can completely ruin the\u00a0carburetor. If this happens, you\u2019ll have to deconstruct the carburetor, clean it up, and put the engine back together again. It\u2019s a major hassle, and let\u2019s face it: when the weather warms, you\u2019d rather be out cruising than reconstructing your carburetor.\nHowever, the good news is that there is a quick, easy, and inexpensive way to fix this problem. You can use a\u00a0fuel stabilizer\u00a0to ensure that the fuel does not cause damage to your precious automobile.\n\nWhat is\u00a0Fuel Stabilizer?\n\nIf you are wondering, \u201cWhat does fuel stabilizer do?\u201d, fuel stabilizer is a substance that is specifically made to help the gasoline in your tank not corrode the engine. Basically, it\u2019s an anti-expiry solution that will keep the gasoline fresh for longer than it would be otherwise. Most fuel stabilizer solutions will protect the engine for at least 24 months, which is considerably than any winters we\u2019ve seen.\nIn the event that you need to store your vehicle for longer than this, you\u2019ll need to drain the engine. However, if you\u2019re just storing your vehicle for a couple of months or a season, this is a messy endeavor and best avoided. It\u2019s much easier just to put a measure of fuel stabilizer in your tank when you\u2019re looking to store the car and you can forget about it until the next year. (And, hey, your car will already have some fuel to get it started.)\n\nHow to\u00a0Use Fuel Stabilizer\n\nFortunately, using fuel stabilizer is a simple, DIY-friendly procedure, even for those who don\u2019t own any tools. So long as you can access your gasoline tank (we hope you can), you\u2019re good to use fuel stabilizer. The first thing you will want to ensure is that you are running your tank on nearly empty.\nAt this point, all you need to do is open the fuel tank, measure out the amount of stabilizer that is recommended by the fuel stabilizer manufacturer, and then pour this into the gas tank.\nIt is a good idea to top off your tank at this point. If you can go with a gas that does not have ethanol, this is best. Filling your tank will help minimize the chance that the\u00a0fuel system\u00a0of your car is exposed to air or water.\nYou\u2019ll need to turn the engine on for a few moments to let the gasoline move through it and ensure that the fuel stabilizer solution is evenly distributed throughout the tank. Typically, you aren\u2019t going to need to run the engine for more than 5-10 minutes. Assuming that you are driving the car home from the gas station, that is probably enough time.\nAfter this, you\u2019re finished! Again, no tools required, and it is absolutely worth taking a few minutes before storing your vehicle to protect your engine from corrosion.\n\nDoes Fuel Stabilizer\u00a0Only Work on Cars?\n\nYou can use fuel stabilizer on anything that has an engine. In addition to storing cars, you can also use it to help protect lawn mowers, snowmobiles, or even generators. If it has a gasoline engine and you are looking to store it, it is highly likely that you will be able to use fuel stabilizer to protect it.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Throttle Position Sensor",
        "content": "What Is a Throttle Position Sensor?\n\nThis vital sensor allows your engine to maintain a proper amount of air. This feature is dependent on the throttle valve. When you press down on the gas pedal, your throttle body unit\u2019s valve opens. This causes your throttle position sensor to adjust the engine intake manifold accordingly.\nThis little sensor is essential to a correct mixture of air and fuel. It\u2019s integrated with your engine control module and helps keep your idling and acceleration smooth. When this sensor is damaged or not working properly, it\u2019s important for you to replace it to restore your vehicle to its full performance and power.\n\nSymptoms of a Failed Sensor\n\nThere are many symptoms of a failed throttle position sensor. While some of these symptoms could also be signs of other engine issues, watch out for these symptoms of bad TPS, or throttle position sensor.\nThe most common symptom is your check engine light. This indicator is a vague symptom, as it could also point to a variety of issues, but you can expect to see it if there\u2019s any issue with your throttle position sensor.\nNext, any unusual changes in your acceleration could be linked to this sensor. During your normal driving, consider inspecting your sensor if you experience any of these throttle position sensor symptoms:\n\nHesitations during acceleration\nPoor power\nDifficulty and/or delay in gear shifting\nUnusual surges while accelerating\n\nEach of these could be signs that your throttle position sensor isn\u2019t working correctly. Too much airflow or too little could cause poor acceleration performance, but it could also be linked with other engine issues. If you notice your fuel economy has dropped dramatically, it could be a result of an improper fuel and air mixture.\nSimilarly, if your engine struggles to idle efficiently, it could also be a result of a damaged throttle position sensor. Stalling, surging, or hesitating while idling all can be caused by this unassuming sensor.\nThe best way to determine if these issues are caused by your throttle position sensor is to go to the source. By using a multimeter, you can determine if the sensor has an electrical connection issue. Check the engine control module for the trouble code that resulted in your illuminated check engine light to see if it is linked with your throttle position sensor. These two steps can also help you determine whether you need to repair, replace or reprogram your sensor.\n\nRepair, Reprogram, or Replace Your Sensor\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone through the symptoms of a bad throttle position sensor, it\u2019s time to find a solution. Completely replacing your sensor may be the best way to avoid future issues, but some issues can be easily fixed by reprogramming or repairing your sensor.\nReprogramming or resetting your sensor can sometimes solve these issues. This step can also be necessary when you install a new sensor. The easiest way to reset your throttle position sensor is to unhook the negative cable from your battery for up to five minutes or to remove the fuse for your engine control module. Don\u2019t attempt this if you\u2019re uncomfortable working with electricity, as removing the wrong fuse or cable from your battery could be dangerous. Resetting is sometimes all that is required to restore your sensor. Code errors can cause your throttle position sensor to work erratically or incorrectly. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need professional software to reprogram your sensor. This job is best done by a professional mechanic.\nIf your sensor just needs repairs, it could be the result of faulty or loose wiring. Just like any other electrical wiring, your throttle position sensor is susceptible to corrosion and faulty connections. Once you\u2019ve established the issue is with your sensor and that it isn\u2019t a programming fault, check the wiring and connection points before purchasing a new one.\nFinally, sometimes your sensor is irreparably damaged. A broken sensor needs to be replaced in order to restore full functionality to your vehicle.\nIf your vehicle is having engine issues, it can be difficult to find the culprit. Many different components, including the throttle body system, work together to provide the engine with smooth acceleration. If you\u2019re concerned with the throttle body or are experiencing acceleration and idling issues, review these throttle body symptoms to determine whether your vehicle needs a new throttle position sensor and what you can do to repair, replace or reprogram your sensor.\n\nHowTO\u00a0Replace Your Throttle Position Sensor\n\n1. Removing Your Sensor\n\nFollow these steps to replacing your sensor. First, find the sensor. It should be mounted to your throttle body, which is on top of your engine.\nYou should disconnect your negative battery cable before removing the sensor. This helps you avoid the risk of electrical shock or causing an error code on your engine control module. Your throttle position sensor should be attached using electrical connectors. These connectors are easy to remove using the tab on the side.\nOnce the electrical connectors are removed, look for the mounting screws on your sensor. Carefully unscrew and remove your throttle position sensor. Be sure to read your owner\u2019s manual and compare it with your current sensor when shopping for a new one. Shop at your local auto parts store to find a quality brand or exact OEM match.\n\n2. Installing a New Throttle Position Sensor\n\nInstall your new sensor by working backward through the removal steps. Start by installing the sensor using the mounting screws. Next, connect your sensor to your vehicle\u2019selectrical system using a convenient electrical connector. You should be able to easily push it together and hear a distinct click. Check to ensure a firm connection.\nConnect your battery and prepare to double-check your work. Start your car and test the idle and acceleration. Depending on your vehicle and the sensor you\u2019ve installed, you may need to manually adjust the sensor. Other options automatically adjust to offer your car the optimal levels of air and fuel for a smooth idle and powerful acceleration.\n\nWhether you follow these installation steps or ask your local mechanic to replace your throttle position sensor, looking for these symptoms can vhelp you avoid costly engine repair, poor fuel economy or exponential damage to your vehicle. Inspect your throttle body when you see these symptoms and determine whether you need to reprogram, repair or replace your sensor.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How to Fix Your Gas Gauge",
        "content": "How Does a Gas Gauge Work?\nThe best way to explain the mechanics behind a gas gauge is to visualize a toilet float valve. Inside of your toilet\u2019s tank there is a float arm. This float arm is how your toilet knows to shut off the water valve after you have flushed and the tank has refilled. When you flush a toilet, the water rushes out of the tank into the bowl, and the float arm lowers with the dispensing water. The toilet\u2019s water valve is open at this point and water will flow back into the tank of the toilet. When the float arm reaches a certain height, the valve shuts off and water stops flowing.\nYour gas gauge works in a similar (more complex, but similar) way. There is also a float-like instrument inside your gas tank that is connected to a rheostat (or resistance-sweep\u2026think of a volume knob on a stereo) which communicates directly to the fuel gauge. When your fuel level is full, the electrical resistance at the sender changes, sends the signal to the gauge, and this is what causes the gauge to read as full after a fill-up. Depending on the level of electrical resistance, the fuel gauge changes to reflect the level of gas in the tank. In the event that the fuel gauge constantly reads empty, full, or some random nonsensical reading, then there is an issue with the fuel gauge, the sender, or the wiring in between.\nThe following will walk you through where to start in diagnosing your fuel gauge issues, as problems could be in multiple places.\n\nHOW TO TEST A FUEL GAUGE\n\n1. DETERMINE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER SELF-TEST PROCEDURE\n\nThe easiest way to begin is to look in your owner\u2019s manual and figure out how the instrument cluster self-test procedure is done. Depending on the age of your car and the model, the process for this varies. Once you have figured out how to activate the cluster self-test procedure, go ahead and perform it. If you have an older vehicle \u2013 pre-1990\u2019s, the chances are this procedure cannot be done.\n\nIn newer cars this typically involves turning on and off the\u202fheadlights\u202fa certain number of times and pressing the odometer button; in older ones turning on and off the ignition a few times is generally required.\n\nThe fuel gauge needle should go through a full sweep during the cluster self-test process. If it does not, the issue is with the fuel gauge directly. However, if the fuel gauge needle does its sweep as it is supposed to, you need to perform further tests to properly diagnose the problem.\n\n2. CHECK THE FUSES\n\nThe next step after performing the cluster test is to check the\u202ffuses. Particularly if you are experiencing an issue with more than one gauge on your vehicle, the culprit may be a fuse. If the fuse for the instrument panel has been blown, make sure to replace it. Then go ahead and turn on the car. If the fuel gauge doesn\u2019t sort itself out automatically, run the cluster test again.\n\n3. CHECK THE WIRING\n\nTesting the wiring is not particularly difficult, but it can be time-consuming. The best place to start is at the gas tank itself. On most vehicles, you will have a wiring harness at the gas tank that handles power for the fuel pump and for the sending unit. Older vehicles with no electric fuel pump will usually have a single wire for the sending unit, and a ground wire attached to one of the screws of the sending unit, grounding out at the frame nearby. It\u2019s absolutely important that you check the ground connections first. Because of rain, salt, snow, etc being splashed at the back of the vehicle, it is very common for a sending unit ground to fail, even if the wire is still in tact. Remove the ground connection, clean, and re-attach. You need to visually inspect the wiring as any break or damage to the sending unit wire, or ground will cause a problem at the gauge. In most cases, to gain access to the fuel tank sending unit mount / fuel pump mounting hole, you\u2019ll need to drop the gas tank down. Be sure to do this when there is either minimal gas in the vehicle, or it\u2019s been siphoned out. Most gas gauge issues can be traced to an issue with the wiring near the tank, or with the sending unit itself.\n\n4. VISUALLY INSPECT THE SENDING UNIT / TEST\n\nIf your wiring and fuse test as passed, usually the next option is to remove the fuel sending unit / fuel pump assembly from the tank and inspect. Some times, the arm or float will be broken, or the wiring leading up and out of the sending unit will be damaged. On older vehicles with a 1-wire sending unit, resistance can be tested easily. Most older sending units are a \u201c0-30\u201d or \u201c0-60\u201d ohm sending unit, meaning that when the tank is at empty, the resistance will read 0ohms, where at full, it will read 30, or 60ohms. To test this, simply put your mutl-meter to ohms (resistance) setting, and touch off one probe to the sending terminal, and the other probe to ground. Slowly move the float up and down, and you should see the resistance change on the multi-meter. If you see no change in resistance, the sending unit is bad. On newer sending units that incorporate the fuel pump into the assembly, this is more difficult, if not impossible to perform, but often times, test procedures can be found online. If the sending unit is suspect on a newer vehicle, unfortunately, the entire fuel pump assembly must be replaced in most cases.\n\n5. TEST THE GAUGE WITH A MULTIMETER\n\nOn older vehicles or boats, the fuel gauge will usually have 2 terminals. One of these terminals receives 12V of power when the ignition is turned on. The other terminal is the sending wire from the sending unit. The gauge itself is then grounded. If you do not have 12V at the power wire, the lack of power will need to be troubleshooted. You can also test continuity between the sending terminal at the dash, and where it connects back at the tank. If you have no continuity, there is a break in this wire somewhere. To check the fuel gauge itself, remove the instrument cluster from the dash and test it with the multimeter for resistance. Different gauges can be tested using different methods, so seek out the proper test procedure in a\u00a0repair manual\u00a0or online. On newer vehicles, the gauge cluster and fuel gauge are much more difficult, if not impossible to test. To check the fuel gauge itself on newer vehicles, remove the instrument cluster from the dash and you may have to disassemble the cluster to remove the gauge. While gauges themselves can fail, generally the problems are found in wiring or the sending unit, rather than the gauge, so it\u2019s best to rule out all the other possibilities before tackling the gauge itself.\n\nA Functioning Gas Gauge\nTracking down fuel gauge issues can be a pain. It\u2019s one of those critical gauges that if it doesn\u2019t work, can leave you stranded, or at least, constantly tracking your mileage out of fear of running out of gas. Remember to start with the basics\u2026.fuses, wiring, grounds, and work your way to the more complicated possibilities. In most cases, the problems can often be found with the basics.\n\nShop all Gauges",

        "title": "The Evolution Of Fuel Injection",
        "content": "What Is Electronic Fuel Injection?\n\nIf you are new to automotive maintenance, you might know your car has fuel injection but not understand what that means. It\u2019s a pretty common state to be in, and the principle behind the mechanism is simple. Where carburetors mix fuel and air using mechanical means only, fuel injection uses electronic monitoring and calibration to precisely control the air/fuel mixture. There are a few different designs, including an old system that was more like an automated carburetor.\n\nThe First Fuel Injected Car\n\nWhile fuel injection systems were developed early in the history of the internal combustion engine, they did not enter the automotive market until the late 1950s. In World War I, fuel injected plane designs were used in the fighting, and it continued to make appearances in aircraft design after that. If you are asking yourself when was fuel injection invented, that is the answer, but what about the first fuel injected car?\nGM introduced its first fuel-injection model to the automotive market as an option in 1957. It was in the options packages for many vehicles that year, but the early design didn\u2019t have all the bugs worked out, so it was dropped from all models except the Corvette the very next year. It remained an option in the Corvette until 1965, leading many to remember it as the first successful fuel injected model.\n\nThe Fuel Injection Revolution of the 1980s\n\nIt took a couple of decades for fuel injection to take over the automotive world. First, revisions to that initial buggy design needed to be made. Then, a new marketing campaign aimed at assuring customers that the modern fuel injected engine was a different animal from the initial design in the late 1950s had to overcome the public perception of the option. Luckily, the numbers spoke for themselves as fuel injection models were tested side by side with their counterparts.\nToday it might seem like intuitive truth that precision control over the fuel/air mixture so it precisely matches the needs of your head size and piston length will deliver better overall power and fuel efficiency, but when it was new it was just another possible point of mechanical failure in the minds of many mechanics and auto enthusiasts alike. The biggest contributor to the success of the systems in the 1980s was the increased computing power and smaller size of EFI modules, allowing for better control in the fuel injection system and a more consistent performance when it was used in engine design.\n\nWhat Killed the Carburetor?\n\nOK, so fuel injection is more efficient and precise, but that usually isn\u2019t enough to totally kill a competing design, especially not when it is as easy to self-repair as most carburetors. What killed carburetors was air pollution. Carb designs, no matter how careful, simply produced more waste in the form of emissions than fuel injection did. As the Los Angeles skyline and other famous and highly populated areas felt the impact of widespread automobile use, local and state governments began stepping in to pressure the automakers, both behind closed doors and through emissions regulation. Eventually, the federal government followed suit.\nAutomakers spent much of the 1970s trying to design carburetor technology that would be able to keep up with the clean air demands being placed on vehicles, but in the end the designs became complex and unwieldy. It was simpler and more efficient to switch to electronic fuel injection, from both a design and a performance standpoint.\n\nSingle Port vs. Multi-Port Injection\n\nEarly EFI units typically didn\u2019t last past 100,000 miles before burning out and needing replacement. For many, this set the upward life expectancy of a vehicle around that number once EFI became the standard. The main reason for it was a design feature called single port fuel injection. Single port injection looked almost like a carburetor with an air filter on top, but there were fuel injectors inside its enclosure, operating to precisely inject liquid fuel into a shared cavity for mixing with air. Multi-port injection split up the injectors and positioned the spray right before the intake valve to maximize efficiency, allowing for longer lasting and more efficient designs.\n\nDirect Injection and the Modern EFI System\n\nSingle-port fuel injection initially suffered a power fall-off when compared to similar carb models because automakers had been so invested in carburetor technology for so long, they couldn\u2019t design EFI systems that were optimized for the unique features of EFI at first. As they learned and shifted tactics to make use of the new technology, both power and efficiency came up until systems were performing better than the alternative while producing fewer emissions.\nDirect injection was one of the steppingstones to modern systems that helped the process along. Introduced in the 1990s as vehicles became more compact and engines leaner and smaller for their power outputs, it represented a leap forward in the use of the tech. Direct injection\u2019s big innovation was adding the fuel directly into the combustion chamber, rather than mixing fuel and air in the intake manifold. This allowed for even greater precision, and when combined with more reliable and powerful EFI controllers, it allowed the designs you see when you shop performance fuel injection upgrades today.

        "title": "Do You Need Lead Substitute?",
        "content": "Why Was Leaded Fuel Used?\n\nIn the 1920\u2019s, car manufacturers began frantically looking for a substance that could stop engine pre-detonation (knock, or pinging) and finally settled on Tetraethyllead\u202f(commonly styled\u202ftetraethyl lead), and abbreviated\u202fTEL. This lead worked to do several important things and became the standard for gasoline for half a century. It worked well, and it was the cheapest solution at the time:\nLead helped reduce knocks or \u201cpinging\u201d. Lead massively raised the octane levels of gasoline, and it needed to be once engines in the late 1950\u2019s started to ramp up compression ratios in the never-ended horsepower race, while still operating on very primitive ignition systems.Lead minimized wear and tear on the car\u2019s valves and valve seats by reducing microwelds between the seat and the valve.\nWhat are microwelds? The combustion chamber area is the hottest place inside the engine, as is the area near the exhaust valve, where hot exhaust gases exit. As these valves open and close, fusion between the two can happen in the form of small micro-welds, that then rip apart the moment the valve is opened again. Over time, this deteriorates the valve and the valve seat, until it can no longer seal, and a valve job must be done. Lead stopped or slowed this process by providing a barrier between the seat and the valve.\n\nHow Long Has Leaded Fuel Been\u00a0Off the Market?\n\nPeople first began to understand just how toxic lead really was by the middle of the 1950\u2019s, but it wasn\u2019t until the 1970\u2019s and the creation of the EPA that were these dangers acted upon. In addition to the health and environmental hazards it posed, it was also found that lead didn\u2019t gel well at all with catalytic converters and could drastically affect their function. The state of California was the first to officially decide leaded fuel was a no-go back in 1992, and once that happened, it didn\u2019t take long at all for the rest of the country to follow in its footsteps.\nIt\u2019s important to note though, that by the mid-1970\u2019s, most vehicles were being manufactured to accommodate Unleaded fuel as the EPA phase-out of leaded gas began in the 1970\u2019s. The main change happened in the form of valve seats that were hardened, more durable, and better able to resist the effects of the high temperatures responsible for the formation of microwelds. Unleaded gasoline no longer posed a threat to engines at all once those standards became mainstream, but even throughout the 1980\u2019s, the common theme was which pump to use at the gas station \u2013 Regular or Unleaded?\n\nDo You Need Lead or Substitute in an Old Car Today?\n\nThe answer to this question is a bit of raging debate, and it has more to do with the presence of hardened valve seats in the heads of any engine built prior to 1980. See, many engines of old have been rebuilt at one point or another over the course of 40-80 years. During that time, having the cylinder heads rebuilt is very common, and one of the most common upgrades done at that time is to add hardened seats into the heads. Once this is done, the need for any lead substitute of any kind is moot.\nIf you are unsure about whether or not your car\u2019s engine, or heads have been rebuilt and hardened seats have been added, then decisions can be made, and even here, debate still rages. Many older classic cars are not driven much, and when they are, they aren\u2019t driven far, or worked hard, which is why many machinists and engine rebuilders will tell you that hardened seats aren\u2019t necessary, and simply running a lead substitute or even nothing at all but regular 93 octane will suffice just fine. Many other machinist and engine builders will insist that whether it\u2019s a weekend cruiser or a daily driver hauling things, to put hardened seats in when you rebuild the heads.\nIn the meantime though, in any of these cases, lead substitute is something that can help. Keep in mind this also does not mean that failure to run a lead substitute is going to lead to disaster. As stated before, many older classic cars are not run hard, nor on long road trips or grueling work where cylinder head temps even reach the point where micro-welds could occur. Because of that, there are tons of old cars still cruising the roads, without hardened seats, running on unleaded gasoline without issue. But, if you are concerned, remember that running lead substitute isn\u2019t going hurt \u2013 it will only help.\n\nIs It Still Possible To\u00a0Buy Leaded Fuel?\n\nOf course, you may simply be asking: \u201cWhere can I buy leaded gas?\u201d After all the real thing has got to be better for your classic car than a substitute, right? To answer that question: you\u2019re not going to be able to roll up to a gas station and buy leaded gas anymore. Technically speaking, it does still exist and is permitted in specific types of vehicles (like aircraft or farm vehicles, to name two examples). It\u2019s no longer legal to put leaded gas in your car though, whether it\u2019s a classic or not.\nDon\u2019t even think about trying to do it on the downlow either. If you\u2019re found to be driving a car with leaded gas in the tank, you could well wind up slapped with a hefty $10,000 fine for your ingenuity. In other words, lead substitute is really the only acceptable alternative.",

        "title": "How To Defog Windshield",
        "content": "Understanding Windshield Fogging\n\nWindshield fogging is a common issue faced by drivers, especially during colder months. It occurs when warm, moist air inside the vehicle comes into contact with the cold surface of the windshield, leading to condensation. Several factors contribute to windshield fogging, including temperature differentials, humidity levels, and external weather conditions.\nTo break it down, when the air inside your vehicle is warmer and more humid than the outside air or the surface of your windshield, moisture accumulates and forms fog. Even more challenging, it can freeze and become frost when the temperature is below the 32F freezing mark. Identifying the root causes helps in adopting effective defogging strategies.\nDriving with a fogged windshield poses serious safety risks, impairing visibility and increasing the likelihood of accidents. Addressing fogged windshields promptly is crucial for ensuring a clear line of sight, which is vital for safe driving. Keep in mind, it\u2019s not just about clearing the fog right now, but removing moisture so the fog is less likely to develop the next time you drive.\n\nQuick Fixes for Emergency Situations\n\nIn emergency situations where your windshield fogs up while driving, immediate actions can help restore visibility. Roll down your windows slightly to allow fresh air circulation, reducing the temperature and humidity inside the vehicle.\nWhile it\u2019s not ideal, you can also wipe the moisture off with a paper towel or cloth or, in a pinch, just use your hand. You\u2019ll need to clean the streaks later on that will dry onto the glass.\nThe defrost system is a powerful ally in combating windshield fogging. Ensure your vehicle\u2019s defrost system is functioning optimally. Use it in conjunction with the heater to warm up the windshield and eliminate condensation quickly. This method is especially effective during colder weather. Also, the AC isn\u2019t just for hot weather. It comes on with the defroster for most vehicles, condensing the moisture so it can be drained out of the vehicle. If you turn it off, defogging will take much longer.\n\nPreventive Measures to Avoid Windshield Fogging\n\nProper ventilation is key to preventing windshield fogging.\n\nEnsure your vehicle\u2019s ventilation system is well-maintained and free from debris.\nRegularly clean air vents to maximize airflow.\nDuring colder months, use a combination of fresh air intake and recirculation to balance temperature and humidity inside the vehicle.\nReplace the cabin air filter to promote good airflow.\n\nInvesting in the right products can go a long way in maintaining a clear windshield.

        "title": "How to Properly Adjust Car Mirrors",
        "content": "The Basics of Mirror Adjustment\n\nWhen it comes to driving safety, many factors contribute to a smooth and secure journey, and one often aspect is the proper adjustment of car mirrors. Mirrors play a crucial role in providing a clear view of the surroundings, minimizing blind spots, and enhancing overall visibility. Well-adjusted mirrors not only improve your ability to detect nearby vehicles but also contribute significantly to preventing accidents.\nBefore we delve into the step-by-step guide for adjusting your car mirrors, let\u2019s dispel some common misconceptions. One prevalent belief is that side mirrors should be angled to see the sides of your own car. However, the primary purpose of side mirrors is to capture a view of the adjacent lanes, reducing blind spots and increasing your awareness of approaching vehicles.\nAnother misconception involves the rearview mirror. Many drivers position it solely to see the road behind, neglecting its role in creating a seamless transition between the side and rearview mirrors. Finally, it\u2019s not intended primarily as a device to watch your rear-seat passengers. For parents, an extra mirror can be purchased and installed to monitor kids in the backseat.\nProperly aligned mirrors ensure a panoramic view, leaving no room for surprise blind spots.\n\nSide Mirrors: Getting the Right Angle\n\nGetting your mirrors positioned well to see as much as you can isn\u2019t complicated, but there might be aspects you haven\u2019t though of. Here are steps to perform the best adjustment:\n\nAdjust the driver\u2019s first \u2013 Before touching the mirrors, take a moment to adjust your driver\u2019s seat to your preferred driving position. A comfortable seating position ensures a more accurate mirror alignment, and as soon as you adjust the seat, the angles don\u2019t line up the same.\nFind the side mirror controls \u2013 Locate the mirror adjustment controls inside your car. These are often found on the driver\u2019s side door or dashboard.\nStart with the left mirror \u2013 Start with the left side mirror. From the driver\u2019s seat, position the mirror so you can barely see the side of your car. This may feel unusual at first, but trust that it minimizes blind spots. The only reason to see your car at all is as a reference point.\nNext, move the right side mirror \u2013 Repeat the process for the right side mirror. Adjust it until you can just barely see the side of your car. Again, the key is to focus on maximizing your view of the adjacent lanes.\n\nTips for Eliminating Blind Spots\n\nTo further reduce blind spots, use the overlap technique. Adjust the side mirrors so that you aren\u2019t duplicating what you see in your rearview mirror. This expands your coverage and enhances overall visibility.\nCheck your mirror positioning every time you get in the driver\u2019s seat and readjust your mirrors, especially after someone else has driven your car. This simple habit ensures that mirrors are positioned well to keep you safe.\n\nRearview Mirror: Finding the Perfect View\n\nThe rearview mirror is intended to see what\u2019s directly behind your car, and you want as much coverage as possible. Even minor adjustments can make a big difference in visibility.\n\nAdjust the tilt \u2013 Tilt the rearview mirror up to a point where you can see the entire rear window without unnecessary visibility of the car\u2019s interior.\nCentralize the view \u2013 Center the rearview mirror to provide a seamless connection between the side mirrors and maintain a continuous line of sight.\n\nAdjusting for Driver\u2019s Height and Seating Position\n\nIf you\u2019re tall and have a more upright seating position, you might need to adjust the rearview mirror slightly higher to avoid blocking your view. Many rearview mirrors have a ball and socket design that lets you maneuver the mirror closer to the headliner. Conversely, shorter drivers may need to lower the mirror to capture the full view without any major obstructions.\n\nAvoiding Common Mistakes\n\nFor such a simple component, it\u2019s easy to get the adjustment wrong. Common mistakes can include:\n\nSeeing too much of your own car in the side mirrors. As mentioned earlier, positioning side mirrors to see the sides of your car is a common mistake that restricts your view of adjacent lanes.\nNeglecting to adjust the mirrors every time. It\u2019s easy for your mirrors to lose their adjustment, from being bumped in a parking lot to being moved at a service center or by another driver. Regularly inspect and adjust your mirrors to ensure optimal visibility.\n\nWhile driving on a multi-lane road, make lane changes to both sides. If there are areas where you lose sight of other vehicles, it\u2019s an indication of misaligned mirrors.

        "content": "Introduction to Side View Mirror Replacement\n\nSide view mirrors play a crucial role in ensuring safe driving by providing a clear view of surrounding traffic. Unfortunately, they are also susceptible to damage due to accidents, vandalism, or even regular wear and tear. The glass can delaminate or get cracked, and the mechanical function can break to prevent adjustment. For electric-adjustment and heated mirrors, the electric motors or the heating element can stop working.\nBeyond aesthetics, a broken side view mirror poses serious safety risks and may lead to legal consequences. Driving without a functioning mirror not only compromises your ability to make informed decisions on the road but may also result in traffic violations. Replacement is not just about maintaining appearance but ensuring safety and compliance with traffic laws.\n\nTools and Materials You\u2019ll Need\n\nBefore embarking on the replacement journey, gather the following tools and materials \u2013\n\nScrewdriver set\nTrim removal tools\nSocket wrench set\nTorx wrenches\nPanel clip removal tool\nReplacement side view mirror\nAdhesive or mounting clips (if applicable)\nSafety gloves\nSafety glasses\n\nHow to Remove of the Old Mirror\n\nEach model will have a specific procedure to remove a broken exterior mirror, but these general steps will help get you started.\n\nDisconnect the power source \u2013 If your mirror is power-adjustable or heated, disconnect the battery to prevent a short circuit or blown fuse.\nRemove the mirror cover \u2013 Use a trim removal tool to carefully pry off the mirror cover.\nAccess the Mounting Nuts/Bolts \u2013 Locate and remove the mounting nuts or bolts securing the mirror to the door.

        "title": "Window Not Working? 9 Reasons Why Window Motors and Regulators Fail",
        "content": "How Window Motors and Regulators Work\n\nManual windows aren\u2019t very common\u00a0on new cars anymore, but there are\u00a0many\u00a0on the road with them still. The crank on the inner door panel is turned by hand to\u00a0move a gear inside the door, lifting and lowering the window glass on a scissor-style regulator.\nPower windows simplify the motion.\u00a0A small electric\u00a0motor\u00a0fastened inside your door\u00a0operates the system when you press the button inside your car, rather than a hand crank.\u00a0The motor\u00a0rotates one way to lift the window and\u00a0the opposite direction to lower it.\u00a0The motor is attached to cables\u00a0and a track system that lift and lower the window glass, better known as a regulator.\nSome regulators are scissor-style while other are\u00a0on a geared arm or have a lift plate. Regardless of which design your car uses, the basic structure remains the same.\nSome windows will work dependably for the vehicle\u2019s full lifetime. Others, not so much.\u00a0Heavily used power windows will tend to experience problems more frequently, and drivers in climates that freeze for a serious portion of the year\u00a0will probably see a higher frequency of issues than those in sunny, warm climates.\u00a0Why they fail can often boil down to one of these four factors.\n\nCommon Causes of Window Problems\n\n1. Child Lock Button\n\nIt might seem like an obvious solution to the problem; however, it\u2019s overlooked quite regularly. The button that prevents rear-seat occupants from opening the windows could be engaged, making for a simple, no-cost repair. Checking this first could save you some effort.\n\n2. Worn Cables\n\nThe same type of twisted wire cables that you\u2019d find on bicycle brakes are used for window regulators. As they move over a roller on the regulator, strands of the cable can snap and snag on the channel or jam into the cable\u2019s sheath. This is the type of symptom you\u2019d see from heavy usage primarily.\nWith one or more strands of cable broken, the window is apt to stop moving at a certain point in its journey up or down. Unfortunately, cables aren\u2019t replaceable individually, so a new regulator is required.\n\n3. Broken Clips, Guides, or Rollers on the Regulator\n\nClips that attach the window glass to the regulator can sometimes be part of the regulator itself. Made of white plastic, they can get brittle over time and snap off. When that happens, you might find the window motor still sounds like it\u2019s moving but the glass isn\u2019t going anywhere. Some models have clips that can be replaced individually, but generally, the regulator will need to be replaced.\nThe same is true for plastic guides on scissor-type regulators that keep the window inline moving up and down, as well as rollers attached to the channel. Most of these guides and rollers can break due to dry channels, and since they can\u2019t be replaced individually, a new regulator is required.\n\n4. Window Motor Burnt Out\n\nA 12-volt power window motor can definitely move the window glass up and down with what seems like little effort. But add some extra strain and it can struggle. In climates where ice and snow stick around for months, the power window motor can often fail if the driver tries to \u2018break\u2019 the window free when it is frozen shut.\nMechanically, the electric motor inside the door is straining against two cables as it tries to pull the window free and overloads internally when it doesn\u2019t succeed after multiple tries.\nWindow motors can also fail for no reason whatsoever \u2013 they are an electrical part, after all. Sometimes it will move slowly before quitting altogether when the motor has been weakened.\n\n5. Stripped Window Motor\n\nThe window motor has a small gear that fits into the regulator. This gear can strip if it\u2019s strained too much, or the clutch mechanism inside the window motor can fail. It sounds like the window motor is still working, but without the gear functioning, the window glass won\u2019t move.\n\n6. Dry Channels\n\nWhether your car uses side channels or a center lift channel, it\u2019s made of metal with plastic rollers that are lubricated from the factory. With frequent use, these channels can lose their lubrication and the motor strains to overcome the extra resistance.\nCaught early on, it might be possible to lubricate the channel with white lithium grease or something similar. Otherwise, the cables can cut into the rollers and jam up the window, requiring the regulator and motor assembly to be replaced.\n\n7. Regulator Gear Damaged\n\nManual windows may have fewer weak spots, but the regulator gear can still be damaged. It\u2019s possible for the gear to wear down, get stripped out, or have one or more teeth break, resulting in a window that gets stuck or won\u2019t roll up or down.\n\n8. Window Switch Problems\n\nAlthough not a part of the window motor or regulator, the power window switch is a related component that could cause window faults. The switch connects a circuit to direct power to the window motor, and if it isn\u2019t making a connection, the window motor won\u2019t engage. Many power window circuits route through the driver\u2019s door master switch, so if a passenger or rear window isn\u2019t working on the driver\u2019s door but it is at the door, it could also be the master switch that is at fault.\n\n9. Corrosion in Connector\n\nAn electrical connection combined with humidity can often generate corrosion buildup. The corrosion interferes with the connection inside an electrical connector, much like if a window switch circuit doesn\u2019t connect. Sometimes corrosion can be cleaned off to restore the window motor\u2019s operation while in other cases it has damaged the connector and wiring, and the assembly needs to be replaced.\n\nWindow Motor and Regulator Replacement Cost\n\nThe cost to replace a window motor and regulator assembly varies greatly, and it\u2019s based on the make and model you drive. For some cars, the window motor and regulator can be replaced individually, while for others it comes as an assembly\u00a0all in one.\u00a0Parts can range from\u00a0under $50 to hundreds of dollars, depending on the vehicle you\u2019re working on. Labor charges vary\u00a0as well. While you can expect the repair to take around an hour at least, some models might\u00a0take two hours or more to change the parts.",

        "title": "How to Fix Small Windshield Cracks",
        "content": "Determine the Size of the Crack\n\nBefore you order a kit or perform any other repair steps you need to identify the extent of the damage. A chip smaller than a quarter and a crack shorter than 3 inches can be easily patched with an epoxy repair kit, but a larger crack or chip may need a professional product or a complete replacement windshield. Be sure your kit fully covers the size of crack of chip on your vehicle before starting the repair process.\n\nChoose a Repair Kit\n\nCompare kits from various brands to find the best option for your windshield. Many brands offer similar products, so use these features to choose a quality kit for your needs:\nCostAcceptable crack or chip sizeExpiration dateCuring steps\nEpoxy has an expiration date, so be sure you use a kit that isn\u2019t too old for proper adhesion. Look for an expiration date or a manufacturer\u2019s date and try to use a kit that\u2019s 6 months old or less.\nSome repair kits have many complicated curing steps or require additional tools or special features, like outdoor use only, so be sure you have all the necessary equipment for your particular repair option. Every packaged kit has its own specific instructions, so be sure to compare the following guide with the instructions included in the kit to ensure proper use.\n\nHOW TO FIX WINDSHIELD CRACKS\n\n1. CLEAN THE AREA\n\nOne of the first steps of how to fix windshield chip is to\u00a0clean the glass\u00a0around the area. Any dirt or other debris in the chip or crack can compromise the patch and create imperfections in the glass. Use a microfiber towel and a small amount of rubbing alcohol to wipe the surface. Use care, since the edges of a crack can be sharp. Be sure the area is completely dry before applying the patch.\n\n2. APPLY THE PATCH AND PEDESTAL\n\nTake the paper backing off the patch and line it up with the damaged area of your windshield. A chip or crack larger than the circle cutout on the patch is too large to be properly patched with this particular kit.\n\nNext, center the patch over the damaged area and place it on the exterior of your windshield. Most patch kits include a pedestal. This molded plastic piece has an angled tube for easy epoxy application. Line up the tabs and press the pedestal against the adhesive.\n\n3. USE THE INCLUDED EPOXY RESIN\n\nSome resins require mixture, while others come pre-mixed or mix as you apply it. Fill the pedestal with liquid resin and use the syringe to compress it completely down into the pedestal. Once the syringe is fully compressed, carefully hold the pedestal as you pull back up on the plunger.\n\nIf mixed correctly, the epoxy in the pedestal won\u2019t be pulled back into the syringe. Draw the syringe fully up without pulling it out of the pedestal. Some kits have a small clip to prevent this from happening. Other kits require you to watch the position of the syringe. Don\u2019t let the syringe pull out completely or you won\u2019t create the necessary vacuum.\n\nDrawing up the plunger causes a vacuum to form in the syringe. The vacuum isn\u2019t strong enough to draw up the epoxy resin, but it can encourage air bubbles to escape from the cracked area.\n\n4. WAIT FOR THE AIR BUBBLES TO ESCAPE\n\nWatch for signs of air bubbles escaping and wait for the allotted time recommended by the kit. This can be anywhere from 1-10 minutes. Don\u2019t remove the syringe until you no longer see air bubbles forming and being drawn out of the resin. Depending on the amount of air bubbles, this can feel like the longest step in how to repair windshield chip.\n\n5. REMOVE THE SYRINGE AND PEDESTAL\n\nAfter all the air bubbles have left the area, push the syringe plunger down again to force the remaining resin into the crack. You may only get the syringe halfway down the pedestal before it stops. Carefully knock on the window with your knuckles and press the syringe once more. Don\u2019t force it; this time it should only move about half an inch.\n\nOnce the allotted time has passed and the epoxy has cured, carefully remove the syringe, patch and pedestal. You may need to put an additional drop on the top of the crack to ensure there\u2019s no dimple or dent from application.\n\n6. USE THE CURING STRIP\n\nMost repair kits come with a curing strip for the final layer. Place this on the crack carefully to avoid air bubbles. Hold the strip in place and squeegee any remaining air bubbles. Let the strip rest for the recommended time in the instructions before scraping it off with a razor blade. Don\u2019t rush this step or attempt to remove the strip by hand, but use care to scrape it off for a clean finish.\n\n7. REMOVE EXCESS EPOXY\n\nScrape off any remaining resin with your razor blade. Use care to avoid any fingerprints or damage to your windshield. As you carefully scrape off the remaining resin and curing strip you should have a flawless windshield.\n\nShop for Repair Kits Today\n\nEnjoy quality DIY windshield repair kits at your local AutoZone location.

        "title": "How to Clean Your Car's Interior",
        "content": "How to Clean Your Car\u2019s Interior\n\n1. Remove All Items\n\nThe first thing that you are going to want to do when you begin to\u202fclean out the interior of your car\u202fis to ensure that you clear out all of your belongings. Some folks practically live in their vehicles, which means that trash can accumulate. If you are driving around with children in tow, the situation can get messy fast.\nMake sure that you remove everything from the interior of the car that is not attached. This includes trash, gym bags, children\u2019s toys, magazines, or anything else that is in there. You may find it advantageous to have a trash receptacle and a recycling bin near the car while you are doing this. Also, remove the front and rear floor mats. Now is a great time to hose them down. Even if they are carpeted floor mats, then can be soaped, scrubbed, and hosed off. Hang them over an outdoor chair or somewhere in the sun for several hours to dry out.\n\n2. Vacuum\n\nOnce you are done removing everything, you can begin the vacuum process. Regardless of whether you start in the back floors or front, move the front seats all the way forward, or backward to gain the most space to vacuum. Don\u2019t forget the trunk or cargo area. Many cars present challenging nooks and crevices, especially along the edge of the door that are tough to fit a vacuum or Shop Vac extension into. \nOne tip is to make your own custom hose tool by attaching a length of smaller heater hose (like 5/8 size) or vinyl hose and taping it around a vacuum extension piece. Then, whenever you need to tackle these tough crevices, install your custom hose, and have the ability to clean tight spots.  \n\n3. Interior Detailing\n\nNow it\u2019s time to start your car\u2019s interior cleaning. Using some basic\u202fcleaning wipes or glass cleaner, you can start wiping down the dash, instrument cluster, and center console. \nMost center console units that have cup holders will have a way to remove either the holders, or the entire section, which can then be cleaned in the sink with soap and water. This is best to remove spilled drink residue and grime. \nFor small cracks, vents, and tough to reach spots, you can use detailing brushes, an old toothbrush, or cotton swabs to clean. \nOnce your plastic dash and interior pieces are clean, these can be treated with interior shine, such as Meguiar\u2019s Supreme Shine interior detailer. Use a microfiber towel or applicator pad to apply the detailer.\nAfter you are done with cleaning the plastic pieces of the interior, you can move onto the interior windows. A\u202fmicrofiber towel\u202for good old paper towel will work well here. Some folks even swear on old newspaper (yes, it\u2019s a thing!) You can go ahead and spray the interior windows with window cleaner and use the towel to get a streak-free shine. If you have tinted windows, make sure that you follow any cleaning instructions that came with them, so you do not accidentally ruin the finish. Don\u2019t forget the inside of the back window, which is often neglected.\nLast, you can address your upholstery. If your seats are cloth, they can be cleaned with either a foam cleaner or a small portable carpet cleaner. If you happen to have leather seats rather than upholstered ones, you can clean them with treatments used specifically for cleaning and conditioning leather, like Lexol products. Make sure to test your preferred cleanser out on a small area to ensure that it does not affect the coloring or feel of the leather. \n\nOnce you are done with all of this, make sure that you leave time for your car to air out. It is likely that you will have used multiple cleaners inside of the car, and while you probably commonly use these cleaners in your house, the small interior of your car will make the smells more overwhelming. Leaving your car doors open for a bit so that the smells can dissipate will make your car a more pleasant place to be.\u00a0\nFinally, you may wish to finish with an\u202fair freshener\u202fif you like to use these in your vehicle.\u00a0\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere is no one best way to clean a car\u2019s interior, but the overall process can be very simple. A few hours of your time on a lazy weekday can help make your car a much more pleasant place to be for the rest of the work week.\nDon\u2019t forget: the more often you clean your car, the less time it takes! Consider how much time you spend inside your vehicle, and it\u2019s easy to see how that time can go a long way to more pleasant times down the road.",

        "title": "Should You Leave Your Windshield Wipers Up?",
        "content": "Is it safe to leave your winshield wipers up?\n\nWindshield wipers are pressed flat to the glass by springs within the wiper arm. These springs are stretched when you pull the wiper arm upwards away from the glass. This is okay for a short time, like when you are changing the wiper blades. However, leaving them in the upward position for a long time can permanently stretch the springs overtime. This is why it is not a good idea to leave your wiper blades up in preparation for cold precipitation. Once you stretch out that spring, the wiper arm can no longer provide the right amount of pressure, causing poor wipe quality. Also, when the wiper arm is in the up position, it is not stable and can easily slam down onto the windshield due to the force of the spring. This force can pull the wiper blade back to the windshield hard enough to crack the glass.\nSo what should you do? There are a couple options:\n\n1. Cover Your Blades\n\nIf you cover your wiper blades in bag, they won\u2019t freeze to the windshield. Plastic grocery bags work, or you could wrap them with plastic wrap or a small tarp. Whatever you use, make sure it is waterproof.\n\n2. Beat the Cold with Deicer\n\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about your wiper blades freezing to the windshield if you have deicer, which is designed to make quick work of ice. You can even get deicing wiper fluid, which can make getting frost off your windshield a breeze.",

        "title": "How Long Do Windshield Wipers Last?",
        "content": "Introduction to Wiper Blade Lifespan\n\nIt seems pretty handy to keep your windshield clear when you drive, but there are significant safety benefits to wiper blades.\n\nThey keep your view clear. First and foremost, wipers remove precipitation, dirt, bird droppings, bug guts, and other debris so you can see where you\u2019re going unobstructed.\nThey reduce eye fatigue. Spots on the windshield can draw your eye away from the road, and the fight between downroad visibility and spots on the glass can tire your eyes out.\nThey keep you safer. By removing obstruction in your view, you can more safely maneuver on the road.\n\nTheir simplistic design means that there isn\u2019t much that can go wrong with them, but wipers will eventually need to be replaced. The rubber blade edge that contacts the windshield, the frame, and the wiper arm connector can all be weak spots, and factors like regular use, overuse on a dry windshield, and environmental exposure can all take their toll.\n\nSigns Your Wiper Blades Need Replacement\n\nHow do you know when your wiper blades need to be changed? Primarily, you\u2019ll notice that they don\u2019t perform as well as they used to. What would once be cleared by a single swipe of the wipers might now take two or three passes to be removed, or it might require a stop at a fuel station to scrub the glass with a squeegee instead.\nCommon signs that wipers are due for a change include:\n\nSwaths of uncleared glass after the wiper goes over it.\nStreaks that always seem to be in the same place.\nSmearing instead of clearing.\nBits of rubber blade edge hanging loose.\nVisible cracks or chunks missing from the blade edge.\nChattering or screeching as the wipers pass over the glass.\n\nOn a visual check, you may notice that the wiper\u2019s hinges don\u2019t move well or the pivot attaching the blade to the wiper arm is tight. Or, there might be metal pieces coming loose from the sides of the wiper blade edge, threatening to scratch the glass.\n\nFactors Affecting Wiper Blade Longevity\n\nGenerally, wiper blades tend to last around 12 months in normal conditions. While it might be possible for them to last much longer under certain conditions \u2013 even three years or more \u2013 it\u2019s a good practice to replace them before they stop working well. And in some areas, that replacement interval could be closer to every six months.\nFor example, direct exposure to UV rays can cause the rubber edge to dry out and crack. Or, frequent drives in snowy and icy conditions can tear the blade edge, even if it is brand new. Other factors that reduce wiper lifespan include high heat and arid, desert-like weather.\nMatch your wipers with the conditions you drive in normally. Conventional wiper blades are a fine choice for most temperate climates, but there are better options if your drives take you outside of those normal situations. Consider getting a set of beam-style wipers that are hingeless and conform to the glass well, helping to prevent problems due to ice and corrosion. For winter driving, winter wipers can be the ideal solution to prevent hinges from getting jammed up with ice and snow.\n\nHow to Extend the Life of Your Wiper Blades\n\nWant your wiper blades to last longer? A little care goes a long way.\n\nWhenever you fuel up, wipe your windshield wiper blade edges with a soft cloth or paper towel wetted with washer fluid to remove crud that builds up.\nWash abrasive debris and larger messes from your glass with a squeegee first, avoiding tears on the edges.\nPark your car out of the sun to prevent UV rays from degrading them.\nDon\u2019t operate your wipers when the windshield is dry.\nAllow your icy windshield to thaw before moving the wiper blades in case they\u2019re frozen to the glass.\u202f\n\nSelecting the Right Replacement Wiper Blades\n\nAlso, be aware that for a majority of models, the driver\u2019s side and passenger side wiper blades are different lengths. The driver\u2019s side is typically longer, providing better visibility where it matters most.\nWiper blades come in various types and materials, each designed to address specific driving conditions. Silicone blades, for instance, offer durability and consistent performance, while hybrid blades combine the benefits of traditional rubber and beam-style blades. Understanding these options allows you to make an informed decision based on your driving habits and local climate.\nYou\u2019ll always find wiper blades for your car at AutoZone from popular brands like Duralast Gold. And whether you shop online or in-store, we\u2019ll help you get the right fit for your vehicle.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "How Windshield Wipers Work\n\nThe windshield wiper system is made up of only a few components, and significant problems can occur when only one of these elements is damaged. The power to the system is regulated by a fuse that\u202fis wired directly to the wiper motor and the switch. When the switch is engaged, the motor rotates, and a network of linked arms, connected by several pivot points, converts this rotation into the back-and-forth motion of the wiper blades. When your wipers stop working, it is a good sign that one of these critical elements is damaged or broken.\n\nFive Reasons for Why Your Wipers May Not Be Working\n\nUnfortunately, your windshield wiper system is prone to problems, especially when you have owned a vehicle for several years. Because of the system\u2019s minimal design, it is somewhat\u202ffragile under the right set of circumstances. Therefore, it is beneficial to understand the most common problems as well as how to resolve them. When it comes to windshield wipers and their controls, there are five common reasons for problems to occur.\n\n1. Torn Blades\n\nThis is the most common issue occurs with the wiper blade itself. The rubber of the blade has a direct correlation to the effectiveness of the system. For example, when the blades are new and fully in contact with the surface of the windshield, they are effective at removing excess moisture. However, when the edges are worn, developing a series of small tears in the rubber, they are less effective because they cannot collect or divert moisture that occurs in the gaps of the blades. Therefore, if you notice that your wipers are streaking and not performing as expected, examine the blade for tears, and replace as needed.\n\n2. External Interference\n\nOne of the most common reasons for poor wiper performance is the presence of\u202fice or snow on the windshield. While windshield wipers are capable of removing light snow and ice, they are not designed to clear away heavy snowfall or ice frozen onto the windshield. If you decide to\u202fuse your wiper blades for this reason,\u202fthen you risk damaging the blades. Some wet snow can be so heavy for the blades that it\u202factually\u202fbends them. Also, if ice has been left to collect and stick to the windshield, then it can be too abrasive on the blades and cause minor tears in the rubber. Always clear your windows of piled snow and ice before turning on your wipers.\n\n3. Failed Motor\n\nIf you notice that your windshield wipers stop working altogether, then it is a good sign that something has happened to the motor. As an electrical component, the motor can short out, causing the wipers to fail. However, it is also possible that there is a loose or disconnected wire in the circuit. If this happens, inspect the connections and the motor as soon as possible and replace any necessary elements.\n\n4. Bad Fuse\n\nBefore the wiper motor goes bad, you will probably experience a blown wiper fuse, which is intentional. The fuse is designed to be the circuits weak spot, which protects the wiper motor. Essentially, if your vehicle\u2019s wiper motor is being overloaded, the fuse will blow to ensure the motor does not become damaged. Therefore, while you might\u202fbe tempted to simply replace the bad fuse, it is better to examine the connections to see if any obstructions could be affecting the wiper motor beforehand.\n\n5. Loose Pivot Joint\n\nLast, your windshield wiper issues could stem from a loose pivot joint. If you remember the mechanics of the windshield wiper system require pivot points to convert the rotational energy of the motor into the back-and-forth motion of the blades. If one of these pivot joints is loose, then it can affect the effectiveness of the blades. Therefore, you will need to check the pivot points and ensure that all nuts and connections are secure.\n\nProfessional\u00a0Inspection\n\nIf you have run through the above list and still cannot resolve your windshield wiper issues, then it might be time to call a professional. Thankfully, the process is pretty\u202fstraightforward, and in some instances, a mechanic might even come to you. They will do a thorough inspection of your entire system to ensure that all the components are in good working order. Through this process of elimination, they will be able to\u202fdiagnose your problem and hopefully resolve it.\nLearning how to fix windshield wipers is not that challenging, but the answer to your problem is not always as simple as replacing your car\u2019s wiper blades. If you are experiencing issues withz your windshield wipers, then head on over to your favorite auto parts store and ask a representative for some assistance. Your vehicle\u2019s windshield wiper system might not be that complicated, but it is integral to your safety.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Who Invented Windshield Wipers?",
        "content": "What Happened Before?\n\nPrior to this handy invention, people in some of the first cars had to contend with rain and snow in much more inconvenient ways. Drivers would have to stop every few minutes and manually wipe of the windshield themselves. Or, people simply wouldn\u2019t drive in such weather. Though car didn\u2019t become widely available until the introduction of Henry Ford\u2019s Model T in 1908, the first automobiles were built in 1885 by Germany\u2019s Karl Benz. It was 1902 when the idea of windshield wipers came to be.\n\nA Southerner\u2019s Visit to the Big Apple\n\nIn 1902, Mary Anderson, a Birmingham, Alabama, native, was on a trip to New York City. On one winter day, she was riding in a streetcar, stuck in traffic. Snow was falling, making it difficult for the driver to see. While the car was stopped, the driver got out and cleaned off the windshield. This happened over and over, causing Anderson to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t a more efficient way of removing snow. The snow impeded the driver\u2019s vision as it built up and the act of stopping to brush it off made the ride much longer. Anderson thought if there was some method of putting a blade on the car that could wipe away the snow, drivers wouldn\u2019t have to keep getting out of cars to clear their vantage point. The thoughts sparked an invention that would benefit every driver in the world.\n\nTo the Drawing Board\n\nWhen she got back to Alabama, Anderson went right to work with her idea. She drew a picture of this water-removing device and described how it would function. Anderson wasn\u2019t merely curious about this concept, nor was she just tinkering with a fanciful dream. She was so serious about it that she applied for a patent for the windshield wipers on June 18, 1903. With Anderson\u2019s device, the driver would work the wipers by using a handle inside the car. The exact language of the patent stated that the wipers would \u201cthus leaving nothing to mar the usual appearance of the car during fair weather.\u201d\n\nSuccess and Disappointment\n\nGood news came to Anderson on November 10, 1903, just five months after filing the patent. The U.S. patent office informed her that it had been accepted. She awarded patent number 743,801 for her \u201cWindow Cleaning Device.\u201d With this significant win in hand, Anderson was eager to market the device and get manufacturers to put it in cars. It certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt her financially, either, if a company were to purchase the idea from her. Unfortunately, no companies were interested in her new invention. She received a letter from one firm that said there was no commercial value in the device that would \u201cwarrant our undertaking of its sale.\u201d She continued to shop around her idea, but no one would accept. She was continuously rejected. Today, it seems easy to be confused by why no one would want to use her invention. Decades later, some of her descendants suggested that the fact she was a woman living in what was then a male-dominated business world had something to do with her inability to interest businesses.\n\nCatching On\n\nEventually, this windshield wiper inventor would see her creation make it into cars, even if it wasn\u2019t her original form. Other inventors such as James Henry Apjohn, John Oishei, and Charlotte Bridgwood filed patents for similar devices that would captivate the interest of the public and manufacturing companies. Fred and William Folberth came up with an automatic wiper that used a vacuum for power. This device was common on cars through the 1950s.\n\nIntermittent Wipers\n\nAnderson\u2019s invention got the ball rolling for other inventors and thinkers to come up with more advanced ways of removing water with windshield wipers. Engineering professor Robert Kearns, of Detroit, Michigan, used electronic components to build a wiper that moved every few seconds. He filed a patent in 1963 for his intermittent device. Kearns wanted the Ford Motor Company to manufacture and sell the device. Ford initially passed on the proposal but offered a similar wiper a few years later. Kearns wasn\u2019t pleased with this development and sued Ford in a patent dispute in 1978. He did the same with Chrysler four years later. He won a settlement in 1990, and a Supreme Court ruling upheld this decision in 1995.\n\nWipers Today\n\nWindshield wipers certainly have come a long way since their humble beginnings at the turn of the 20th century. The next time you\u2019re driving in a rainstorm or during a wintertime blizzard, you can remember the story of Mary Anderson and be thankful for her original design. Though others came after her to refine the concept, this Alabama woman is the pioneer who started it all.",

        "title": "6 Tips for Getting a Better Car Wash",
        "content": "How to Wash Your Car Tutorial Video\n\nHow to wash your car the right way.\n\n6 ways to get a better wash\n\n1. Wash on a regular schedule\n\nSome detailers recommend every week, but every other week is probably fine as long as you immediately address obvious issues like dead bugs, bird droppings, or major dirt buildup.\n\n2. Set up in a good area\n\nSet up to wash the car in a shady area, direct sunlight can cause spotting. We recommend using a dedicated car-wash soap and a microfiber wash sponge. A car wash soap is detergent free. Detergents will cause your wax to have a spider-web finish and create a haze. Wash sponge are great because they hold a lot of soapy water, grab lots of dirt and grime, and won\u2019t leave micro-scratches on your paint. It\u2019s also a good idea to use two buckets. One for clean soapy water, and one with rinsing water to remove dirt from the sponge. If this is not an option, just spray the sponge off between rinsing. It\u2019s never good to wash the whole car and then rinse. The sun and heat can cause soap to dry, making you re-wash.\n\n3. Work from the wheels up\n\nIt might sound counter-intuitive, but you want to start low. Start with the wheels and lower body to clean the dirtiest parts of the car first. Lots of people like to start rubbing down the hood, but the wheels are always the dirtiest part of your car, and you want to get that dirt off before moving on to the paint. Washing the wheels first will also save you time from drying paint twice. Always wait until the wheels have cooled before cleaning them. \n\n4. Take the time to dry the vehicle\n\nYou don\u2019t want soap and dirt residue to hold on the paint after you\u2019ve put in all this hard work. And you\u2019ll need a clean, dry surface if you\u2019re also waxing. It\u2019s a good idea to use a terrycloth or microfiber towel, clean and lint free, for the best drying.\n\n5. Wax in sections, in the shade\n\nYou don\u2019t want the wax to dry before you\u2019ve had a chance to buff, so pick a dedicated section, apply the wax, and buff before moving on. Spray waxes offer an easy way to wax your vehicle in sections. Simply spray while the vehicle is wet, and then use a microfiber cloth to rub the wax onto the surface. If you notice spider-webbing and haze you\u2019ll need to use a cleaner wax. You could also use a nonabrasive cleaning compound to remove the old wax before using a polish. Removing old wax and applying new wax should be done at least once a year.\n\n6. Finish with the glass\n\nIt\u2019s a good practice to clean your interior with appropriate materials as well, shampoo for cloth seats and dedicated leather cleaner for leather seats, but save your glass and windows for last to make sure you catch and residual cleaner from the other applications.\n\nShop All Car Wash and Detailing Products",

        "content": "Tips for Cleaning Your Windshield and Glass\n\n1. Be Aware of When You Clean the Windshield\n\nThere are certain conditions you want to avoid when cleaning your windshield. Obviously you\u2019re not going to have much success if you attempt to clean the outside of the windshield while it\u2019s raining or snowing outside. However, cleaning a hot windshield is also going to create additional problems. \nDirect sunlight or a hot windshield will cause the windshield washer fluid or cleaner to evaporate when it\u2019s applied. This not only creates streaking issues and reduces the impact of the cleaner, but it can also create harmful vapors that can be damaging if inhaled. Always clean a windshield in a garage or in shade to avoid these problems.\n\n2. Choose the Right Supplies\n\nThe first item to choose is the windshield auto glass cleaner. A general rule of thumb is to avoid using products that contains ammonia, alcohol or any ingredients that produce toxic fumes. Glass cleaners come in aerosol cans and spray bottles, and several great auto glass cleaners come in a wipe.\nYou will also need is the right towels or rags to clean the windshield. Back in the \u201cold days\u201d using a newspaper was the best item for effectively cleaning a windshield, but times and technology have changed quite a bit. The best products to use now are microfiber towels.\nWhen you buy microfiber towels, make sure you have (4) to use. Two for the inside glass and two for the outside glass. The first towel will be used to remove liquid residue from the auto glass cleaner, the second is used to remove excessive \u2018fog\u2019 or residual. This step will be addressed below.\n\n3. Start on the Outside\n\nStart by cleaning the outside of the windshield. Spray or apply auto glass cleaner on a small section. If you\u2019re using a spray, follow the directions to determine how long to leave the product on the windshield. Once the product has soaked in (this doesn\u2019t take long, just a second or two), use the first microfiber towel to remove the liquid. \nWhen all liquid has been removed, used the second, clean microfiber towel to \u201cbuff\u201d the windshield. This is best done in a circular motion, to remove the haze that builds-up. Continue these steps until the entire windshield is clean.\n\n4. Continue with the Inside\n\nFor the inside of the windshield, the steps are identical. It might be more difficult to reach certain areas, so clean the inside in three-sections if needed. The Invisible Glass triangle brush is great for helping to clean hard-to-reach corners of the inside of the windshield.\n\nOrder online or visit one of our AutoZone locations to find the best auto glass cleaning supplies that will keep your windshield clean, and improve your visibility as you drive.",

        "title": "How to Bypass Ignition Switch to Start Car",
        "content": "Understanding Ignition Systems\n\nThe ignition system consists of key components such as the ignition switch, starter motor, and the ignition coil. When it\u2019s activated, the system is energized to create the spark necessary to ignite the air-fuel mixture in the cylinders that creates the root of the moniker: ignition. The ignition switch, in particular, plays a pivotal role in initiating the starting process by sending an electrical signal to the starter motor when it\u2019s turned to the START position.\nProblems with the switch can occur from wear and tear that prevents good electrical contact in the switch, or it could be damage from a shorted wire or power surge. A tumbler that piles up internally could also be to blame.\n\nWhen to Consider Bypassing Ignition\n\nRecognizing the signs of a failing ignition switch is crucial for preemptive action. Symptoms may include:\n\nDifficulty turning the key in the cylinder\nIntermittent no-crank problems\nBurning smell or smoke when cranking\nPower loss to accessories\nStalling while driving\n\nBefore attempting an ignition switch bypass, assess your comfort level with DIY automotive tasks. If you\u2019re familiar with basic car maintenance and electrical systems, you may feel confident taking on this challenge. However, if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s always a good idea to seek professional advice or assistance.\n\nTools and Materials You\u2019ll Need\n\nGather the necessary tools and materials before starting the bypass process. Items you should have on hand include:\n\nScrewdrivers\nWire stripper\nElectrical tape\nMultimeter for testing electrical connections\nTrim removal tools\nA jumper wire with switch\n\nEnsure you have the specific tools needed for your vehicle\u2019s make and model.\nSafety should always be a top priority when working on your vehicle. Disconnect the battery before beginning any work on the ignition system. This precautionary step minimizes the risk of electrical shock and protects both you and your vehicle.\n\n\u00a0Step-by-Step Guide to Ignition Bypass\n\n1. Access the Ignition Switch\n\nStart by locating the ignition switch in your vehicle. Use the appropriate tools to remove the panels covering the steering column or on the dashboard and gain access to the switch. Once exposed, carefully inspect the wiring harness at the ignition switch to determine which wire you\u2019ll need to jump to power the START circuit.\n\n2. Connect Bypass Mechanism\n\nWith the ignition switch exposed, connect the bypass mechanism. Attach one end of your jumper wire to the wire responsible for sending the signal to the starter motor and the other end to the battery, creating a direct connection. Follow your vehicle\u2019s wiring diagram to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n\n3. Activate the Bypass\n\nTurn the ignition to the ON position. Then, ll you need to do is press the button on your bypass jumper wire, engaging the starter. Once the engine has started, release the button.\n\nTroubleshooting and Maintenance Tips\n\nAfter completing the bypass, carefully test the system before reassembling everything. If you aren\u2019t removing the bypass, tuck the wiring safely away from anything it could catch on. Turn the key and ensure the engine starts smoothly. And because this is a temporary fix, get your ignition repaired as soon as possible.\nIt\u2019s best to disconnect the bypass jumper when you\u2019ve started your car, preventing the wire from getting caught on moving parts under the hood. If it\u2019s left in place, conduct regular inspections. Check the wiring connections, ensure there are no exposed wires, and verify that the attachment points are secure. This proactive approach can prevent potential problems down the road like a short circuit.\nBypassing the ignition switch may seem like a daunting task, but armed with the right knowledge and tools, it\u2019s feasible. Remember to be safe, follow the step-by-step guide diligently, and check it before every use.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

To tackle this issue effectively, it\u2019s crucial to understand the common causes behind a jammed key. Some common reasons include:\n\nA worn ignition cylinder \u2013 Over time, the ignition cylinder, the component that the key interacts with, can wear out, making it difficult to turn and remove the key.\nMisaligned steering column \u2013 A steering wheel that\u2019s slightly turned can put pressure on the ignition mechanism, making it challenging to turn the key. It\u2019s usually due to turning the wheel after the ignition is off and it locks.\nDamaged key \u2013 A bent, worn, or damaged key is a common culprit. Check your key for any visible signs of wear or deformation and get a new one before it gets stuck.\nShifter not in park \u2013 The shifter interlock solenoid prevents removing the key unless the car is all the way in park.\n\nDIY Fixes\n\nIf you find yourself with a key stuck in the ignition, there are some quick DIY fixes you can try before seeking professional help.\n\nWiggle the steering wheel. \u2013 Sometimes, the steering wheel lock can create tension in the ignition. Gently pull the wheel side to side while turning the key to release the pressure.\nCheck for obstructions \u2013 Inspect the keyway for any debris or foreign objects. Dust and dirt can accumulate over time, causing the key to get stuck, or another key on your keychain could be jamming up and preventing the keys from turning.\nUse graphite lubricant \u2013 Apply a small amount of graphite lubricant to the key in the ignition. This can help ease any friction between the key and the ignition cylinder. Wiggle it and try gently turning it back.\nMove the shifter \u2013 With your foot on the brake, run the gearshift to drive and back to park. The shift interlock will be released once the gearshift is completely in park.\u00a0\n\nOther times, you may need to replace the ignition cylinder or switch to correct the problem. That can happen if the tumbler fails or a bent key gets too stuck to release. To replace the cylinder, you\u2019ll need several common tools including:\n\nTrim tools\nScrewdrivers including Phillips and flathead\nTorx screwdrivers\nGraphite lubricant\n\nEvery vehicle\u2019s replacement process is different, but generally, you\u2019ll need to remove the steering column shrouds or the dash trim. Unplug any electrical connections, unfasten the ignition switch or cylinder, and install the new one in its place. If the cylinder is being replaced, you\u2019ll need to purchase one that\u2019s been rekeyed to your existing key; otherwise, you\u2019ll need to carry a second key.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nWhile DIY fixes can address common issues, there are instances when professional intervention is necessary.\n\nIf your vehicle has an anti-theft system, key replacements and ignition switch replacements may require programming. A locksmith or dealership will need to be involved.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable performing the repair or can\u2019t determine the cause, get a trusted mechanic to diagnose the problem.\n\nAutoZone\u2019s Find-a-Repair Shop Service\n\nPreventive Measures\n\nIn many cases, a key stuck in the ignition could have been prevented. Keep the keyway and ignition cylinder clean from debris by regularly using compressed air or a small brush. Always ensure your steering wheel is straight and not turned when turning off the ignition. This prevents unnecessary pressure on the locking mechanism.\nAs far as maintenance goes, there\u2019s not much required. Periodically apply graphite lubricant to the key and insert it into the ignition to maintain smooth operation. Also, regularly inspect your key for signs of wear or damage.

        "title": "How Does an Ignition Switch Work?",
        "content": "Introduction to Ignition Switches\n\nHow do ignition switches work? Your vehicle\u2019s ignition switch is a small yet mighty component that holds the key to starting your car. The switch and ignition cylinder are often used interchangeably, even though they are separate, with the switch being the electrical portion. It\u2019s responsible for energizing certain circuits based on the ignition\u2019s position. To deliver a current to the starter motor, for example, the ignition switch sends a signal to the starter relay, switching it to provide the current required to fire up the engine.\nImagine being ready to hit the road, only to find that turning the key does nothing. A reliable ignition switch ensures that your car starts without a hitch, offering the reliability you need for your daily commute or long road trips. If it\u2019s not working well, not only is it inconvenient, but it could leave you stranded or even cause your car to stall while you\u2019re driving.\n\nKey Components and Their Functions\n\nInternally, the ignition switch is a series of electrical contacts, just like any other switch. When the switch is moved from the OFF position to one of the other positions, an electrical contact is made, closing a circuit. Keep in mind that the ignition switch seldom has any high-energy current going through it, and instead, it closes the loop on other circuits used for communication.\nThe tumbler, a small but significant part, is responsible for translating your key\u2019s movement into the initiation of the starting process. It\u2019s the mechanical side of the switch. To ensure only the correct key can operate your vehicle, it\u2019s matched to a particular key cut. You\u2019ll use the key to move the tumbler between the different positions.\n\nIgnition Switch Positions\n\nThere\u2019s a standard for the different ignition switch positions that virtually all manufacturers use:\n\nThe OFF position \u2013 This is the position where the key can come out of the ignition when the car is parked. The engine and accessory functions are switched off.\nThe ACC position \u2013 Many, but not all, cars have an ACC, or accessory position. It initiates functions like the radio and power windows without turning on higher-draw systems like the heater fan.\nThe ON position \u2013 This is the position where the additional systems like the heater, safety systems, and instruments are enabled. After starting the engine, your key remains in the ON position until you turn the car off, shutting off the engine.\nThe START position \u2013 The START position is spring-loaded and the switch won\u2019t stay without holding the key there. It\u2019s meant only for cranking the engine over, and the only function it performs is to connect power to the starter motor. Some accessories may turn off momentarily while the key is in the START position.\n\nCommon Ignition Switch Issues\n\nLike any vehicle system, the ignition switch can have issues. If you\u2019re having trouble starting your car, it could be an ignition switch problem. Here are a few things to check to troubleshoot it:\n\nTry using a different key. If your ignition isn\u2019t cranking the engine over, there could be a problem with the immobilizer chip in a key. If a different key for your car doesn\u2019t help, it could be an ignition issue.\nCheck battery power. If the battery is healthy and full but the car won\u2019t start.\nListen for clicking sounds. If there\u2019s no sound from the starter when you turn the key, there may be contact issues in the ignition switch.\nTry the shifter. Rather than the ignition itself, the problem could be that your shifter isn\u2019t all the way in the park position.\nCheck the fuses and relays. Corrosion or moisture can cause issues with the electrical system. Try swapping the relay or fuse with a known good one to see if that\u2019s the problem.\n\nA failing ignition switch can exhibit various signs and symptoms. If you experience any of the following issues, it may indicate problems with the ignition switch:\n\nIf you find it increasingly difficult to turn the key in the ignition switch, the switch or the lock cylinder may be worn or damaged.\nA failing ignition switch might cause the engine to stall unexpectedly or result in intermittent starting problems.\nThe vehicle may lose power while driving if the ignition switch is faulty. This could lead to a sudden loss of engine power, electrical systems, and, in some cases, power steering and braking assistance.\nMalfunctions in electrical accessories, such as the radio, lights, or power windows, may occur due to a failing ignition switch.\nIf you turn the key to the START position and there\u2019s no response from the starter motor or the engine doesn\u2019t crank, the ignition switch may be at fault.\nFlickering or erratic behavior of dashboard lights, especially when turning the key, can be a sign of electrical issues related to the ignition switch.\nIf you hear a clicking sound when turning the key, but the engine doesn\u2019t crank, the ignition switch or its associated components, such as the starter solenoid, may be failing.\nLoss of power in specific key positions like ON or STASRT indicates a problem with the ignition switch.\nA failing ignition switch may cause the key to get stuck in the ignition, making it difficult to remove.\u00a0\nIn extreme cases, a failing ignition switch could lead to overheating or electrical issues, resulting in smoke or a burning smell.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, it\u2019s essential to address the issue promptly to avoid potential safety hazards and further damage.\n\nMaintenance Tips for a Healthy Ignition Switch\n\nOne of the best ways to keep your ignition switch in good shape is simply to reduce the number of keys and items on your keychain. Extra weight hanging on the cylinder can cause issues for both the mechanical and electrical side. Ideally, have your car keys separate from your house keys and other items on a different keychain.\nYou can\u2019t see the inner workings of the ignition switch in a car, but you can keep it moving smoothly by using a lubricant on your key. Silicone spray or powdered graphite are best, and avoid oils that can gum up the parts.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How Does the Car Ignition System Work?",
        "content": "Introduction to Car Ignition Systems\n\nAt the heart of every car\u2019s power lies a crucial system often taken for granted: the ignition system. It serves as the catalyst for the entire combustion process, igniting the fuel-air mixture that generates power to propel your vehicle forward. A small yet powerful spark ignites the mixture in the cylinders, timed exactly to generate the most downward force possible on the piston, forcing the crankshaft to rotate. It\u2019s made up primarily of electrical components.\nIgnition systems have been evolving over the generations, adapting to the changing landscape of automotive technology. From rudimentary systems to advanced electronic setups, the ignition system has transformed to meet the demands of modern engines. Older systems were mechanically driven to time the spark needed, then as electrical advancements occurred, sensors and modules became the predominant methods used.\n\nKey Components of a Car Ignition System\n\nFor gas-powered engines, there are a few key components that are required to deliver the spark to the cylinders:\n\nSpark plugs \u2013 Among the primary players in the ignition system orchestra are spark plugs. These small yet mighty devices ignite the fuel-air mixture within the engine cylinders. Spark plugs generate a spark that initiates combustion, converting potential energy into kinetic power.\nDistributor \u2013 Delivering, or distributing, the electrical charge to the spark plugs is the role of a distributor. It\u2019s driven off of a gear at the front of the engine to maintain the timing.\nSpark plug wires \u2013 Low-resistance cables connect the distributor to the spark plugs, transferring the energy needed for the spark.\nIgnition coils \u2013 On distributorless ignitions, accounting for all modern cars, ignition coils store a low current and convert it to a powerful high voltage the spark plug needs to ignite the air-fuel mixture.\u00a0\n\nIn electronic ignition systems, the engine control unit (ECU) establishes the timing electronically, able to be more precise and more easily adapted than with a mechanical distributor. Other parts that contribute to a smooth-operating ignition system include the battery, ignition switch, and on diesel engines, the glow plugs.\n\nTypes of Car Ignition Systems\n\nThere are several different designs of ignition systems used by manufacturers, whether current or historical. No matter what they\u2019re called by the carmaker, it falls into these four types.\n\nDistributor Ignition System\n\nThe distributor ignition system, also known as a conventional ignition system, is one of the oldest types of ignition systems in vehicles. It consists of a distributor, mechanical points, ignition coil, and spark plugs. The distributor\u2019s primary function is to distribute high-voltage electricity from the ignition coil to the spark plugs in the correct firing order. The spark then ignites the air-fuel mixture in the engine\u2019s cylinders. This type of ignition system is found in older model vehicles.\n\nElectronic Ignition System (EI)\n\nIn the 1970s, the electronic ignition system replaced the traditional mechanical points in many vehicles. This system uses solid-state electronics and a magnetic pickup located in the distributor. The pickup generates a signal that is sent to the ignition control module, which turns the ignition coil on and off. The main advantage of the electronic ignition system is that it eliminates the need for frequent maintenance like the replacement of points and condensers.\n\nDistributorless Ignition System (DIS)\n\nAs the name implies, the distributorless ignition system eliminates the need for a distributor. Instead, it uses multiple ignition coils. Each of these coils serves two spark plugs simultaneously. When one plug is in the compression stroke, the other is in the exhaust stroke, meaning only one spark plug is ignited at a time. DIS improves ignition timing accuracy, reduces high-tension wiring, and enhances overall vehicle performance.\n\nCoil-On-Plug Ignition System\n\nThe coil-on-plug ignition system is the newest and most advanced type of ignition system. Each cylinder has its own ignition coil that sits directly on top of the spark plug. This design eliminates the need for spark plug wires, resulting in a more efficient transfer of the spark. The coil-on-plug system offers better fuel economy, increased power, and quicker starts.\n\nTroubleshooting and Maintenance Tips\n\nEven the most advanced systems encounter issues over time. Recognizing common ignition system problems helps car owners to address issues promptly, preventing potential damage.\n\nIf your car won\u2019t start, it could be due to a variety of reasons, including problems with the battery, starter motor, or the ignition switch. If the engine does not crank and the accessories (lights, radio) do not work, the ignition switch might be faulty.\nAn engine misfire could be due to faulty spark plugs or ignition coils. Inspect the spark plugs. Look for any signs of wear or damage. If they\u2019re old or worn out, replace them. Test the ignition coils with a multimeter. If the resistance readings are outside the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, the coil might need replacement.\nStalling while driving could be due to a problem with the ignition module. Use an ohmmeter to test the module\u2019s resistance. If the resistance is outside the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, the module might be defective.\nPoor fuel economy could be due to a problem with the ignition timing. Use a timing light to ensure the ignition timing is set correctly. If it\u2019s not, adjust it according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, or scan for codes to determine if there\u2019s a sensor that isn\u2019t reading correctly.\n\nRoutine maintenance plays a vital role in ensuring your car\u2019s ignition system operates at peak efficiency. Simple tasks like inspecting and cleaning spark plugs and checking ignition coils for deterioration can go a long way in preventing issues. Maintenance saves you money in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Start a Car",
        "content": "Understanding the Basics\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of how to start a car, take a moment to understand the basics of car ignition systems. The ignition system of a car is responsible for getting the initial motion going in the engine, allowing the car to start and run. The key components involved in starting a car include the battery, starter motor, ignition switch, shift interlock switch, and in some cases, the clutch pedal (in manual cars) or brake pedal (in automatic cars).\nThe battery supplies electricity to the starter motor, and the ignition switch controls the flow of electricity from the battery to the starter motor when you turn the key or press the start button. In manual cars, the clutch pedal needs to be fully depressed before the car starts to ensure the car doesn\u2019t move unexpectedly. In some automatic cars, you may need to press the brake pedal to start the car as a safety measure.\n\nStep-by-Step Starting Process\n\nDifferent designs require different techniques to start the engine. These processes walk you through how to get them each going.\u00a0\n\nKeyed Ignition\n\nA keyed ignition is still the most common style, and by far. Starting a car typically involves inserting the key into the ignition switch and turning it. Most cars have three stages: off, accessories (ACC), and on (RUN/START). The process looks like this:\n\nTurn the key to the ACC position to use features like the radio without starting the car.\nTo start the car, turn the key to the ON position first.\nThen briefly turn it to the START position so it cranks.\nKeep cranking only until the engine fires up, or a maximum of ten seconds.\n\nPush-Button Ignition\n\nMany modern cars come with push-button ignition, eliminating the need for a traditional key. Instead, either a key fob that stays in your pocket or bag or phone-as-a-key, you press a button rather than turn a key. To start these cars, the process is similar:\n\nPress and hold the brake pedal (automatic) or clutch pedal (manual).\nThen press the START button.\nThe engine will crank as long as necessary to start the engine without holding the button down.\n\nManual Transmission\n\nIn manual cars, you need to depress the clutch pedal while turning the key. This disengages the transmission from the engine, preventing the car from moving abruptly when it starts. A safety switch prevents power from transmitting to the starter without the clutch pressed, although some will crank if the shifter is in neutral.\n\nTroubleshooting Common Issues\n\nStarting a car is usually straightforward, but occasionally you might encounter problems. Here are some common issues.\n\nDead battery \u2013 A dead battery is one of the most common reasons a car won\u2019t start. If you turn the key and hear a clicking sound or the engine cranks very slowly, you might have a dead battery. Jumpstarting, charging the battery, or replacing it can resolve this issue.\nIgnition switch problems \u2013 If your car doesn\u2019t start and the battery seems fine, the ignition switch could be the culprit. You might notice the dashboard lights flicker when you turn the key.\nBlown fuse \u2013 If there\u2019s no cranking at all, a fuse might be burnt. Check ignition-related fuses and, if they\u2019re blown, replace it and trace for a reason it burnt.\nStarter motor issues \u2013 A faulty starter motor can also prevent a car from starting. If you hear a grinding noise when turning the key, the starter motor might need replacement.\nShift interlock concern \u2013 If the shifter isn\u2019t in park or neutral on a car with an automatic transmission, it won\u2019t start. Check that it\u2019s in park; otherwise, the switch might be faulty.\nRunning issues \u2013 If it\u2019s cranking strong, it\u2019s possible the engine has problems that prevent it from starting. It could be related to the fuel, air, or ignition systems.\n\nPreventive Maintenance Tips\n\nPreventive maintenance can save you from unexpected starting problems in many cases. Here are things you should try:\n\nChecking your car battery regularly can help you avoid sudden failures. Look for signs of wear or damage, ensure the connections are clean and tight, and consider having the battery tested annually after it\u2019s three years old.\nCold weather can strain car batteries, while hot weather can cause faster battery fluid evaporation. Consider using an engine block heater in winter and parking in the shade or using a car cover in summer.\nRegularly inspect the ignition system for wear and tear. Replace worn-out spark plugs, keep the ignition switch clean, and ensure the starter motor is in good condition.\n\nAdvanced Techniques for Challenging Situations\n\nDespite your best efforts, you might find yourself in a situation where your car won\u2019t start. Here are some advanced techniques to get you going.\n\nJumpstarting a Car Safely\n\nJumpstarting can help get a car running if it\u2019s had a dead battery. Connect one end of the red positive jumper cable to the positive terminal of the dead battery, and the other end to the positive terminal of a working battery. Connect one end of the black negative cable to the negative terminal of the good battery, and the other end to an unpainted metal surface on the car with the dead battery. Start the working car, then try starting the car with the dead battery.\n\nUsing Starting Fluid in Cold Weather\n\nIn cold weather, a shot of starting fluid can help get your engine running. Spray the short blast of the fluid into the air intake, then try starting the car. Be sure to use starting fluid designed for gasoline engines to avoid damage.\n\nEmergency Starting Methods\n\nIn manual cars, you can try push-starting or \u201cbump-starting.\u201d This involves pushing the car to build up speed, then engaging the clutch to turn over the engine. This should only be done in an emergency and as a last resort because it can cause damage.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Failing Ignition Switch",
        "content": "How Does an Ignition Switch Work?\n\nThe ignition switch operates like any other switch does mechanically \u2013 when the contacts change position, it directs power to the circuit or circuits that are selected and cuts power to those that aren\u2019t selected. There are commonly four positions to an ignition switch:\n\nOff. In the OFF position, your vehicle is parked and the engine isn\u2019t running. The ignition-controlled electrical systems are off, and only non-ignition related circuits like the lights continue to operate.\nAccessory. In the accessory or ACC position, systems like infotainment and power windows are often enabled, letting you use limited functions while you\u2019re in the car without the engine running.\nOn. When the ignition is in the ON position, systems like the HVAC controls and dash instruments are on. Essentially, any systems that are enabled when the engine is running are on at this point, and it\u2019s the position your ignition needs to be in when the car is running also.\nStart. The START position is only momentarily powered when the engine is cranking over. This position powers the starter circuit.\n\nThe power for all of these circuits does not flow through the ignition switch. Rather, it\u2019s a low current that\u2019s used, and they operate relays to make these functions work.\nAnother important aspect of many ignition switches is the anti-theft or immobilizer system. \u2018Chipped\u2019 or programmable keys broadcast an RFID, and only an ignition switch that can read the corresponding ID will allow the key to start the car.\n\nSymptoms of a Failing Ignition Switch\n\nThe ignition switch lasts for thousands and thousands of engine starts and key cycles, but there may come a time when it fails. If it does, you\u2019ll encounter symptoms such as these:\n\nKey is hard or impossible to turn in the ignition. If you\u2019re unable to turn the key in the cylinder smoothly, it might be either the cylinder itself or the switch behind it that\u2019s jammed or binding.\nEngine won\u2019t crank. If the electrical contacts inside the switch have failed, turning the key to crank the engine might not result in any response at all.\nEngine starts and stalls. If the engine starts and stalls immediately, it could be an issue with the anti-theft system. It allows the engine to start but doesn\u2019t recognize a valid key so it shuts the engine off again.\nElectrical issues or inoperative accessories. Sometimes, a faulty ignition switch can prevent the accessories and auxiliary functions to stop working since their circuits aren\u2019t receiving a signal to power up.\nStalling when driving. A faulty ignition switch can lose an electrical connection while you drive, such as going over rough roads or bumps or turning the steering wheel.\n\nUnfortunately, these ignition switch symptoms can sometimes be tricky to duplicate and diagnose. They can begin as intermittent concerns and slowly progress.\n\nCauses of a Failing Ignition Switch\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the most common cause of a bad ignition switch is wear and tear. The more ignition key cycles performed, the higher the likelihood of an ignition switch failure. Also, causes can include:\n\nCorrosion on the terminals\nBad wiring\nLoose connections\nElectrical surges or shorts\nPhysical damage from an attempted theft\n\nPreventing Ignition Switch Problems\n\nThe ignition switch is tucked away, out of sight, so there\u2019s not much you can do for preventative maintenance. However, since wear and tear is a leading cause of failure, there are two suggestions that can help in this area.\nFirst, try to reduce any instances of key cycles that aren\u2019t necessary. That\u2019s a tall order since most key cycles are intentional and purposeful, but it can reduce wear on the switch.\nSecondly and most importantly, remove clutter from your keychain. Heavy keychains and trinkets that dangle and sway from your keys can add strain to the cylinder and the switch, causing it to fail sooner. If possible, keep only your car key and fob on the keychain and your other keys separate.",

        "title": "Why is My Car Stalling While I Am Driving?",
        "content": "Charging System Issues\n\nThe alternator is a car component that acts as an electrical generator, converting mechanical energy stored in the battery into electrical energy in the form of alternating current. Your car uses said current to power everything, from replenishing the battery to running the A/C and lighting up the instrument cluster.\nThe alternator usually provides between 13.5 and 14.5 volts, ensuring normal vehicle operation. A faulty alternator can cause significant voltage drops, sometimes even below 12 volts, which could lead to the vehicle stalling, rapid battery discharge, flickering lights, and much more.\nIf your car has a faulty alternator, you probably won\u2019t be able to start it up again. Unfortunately, if this happens, you\u2019ll need to get the alternator replaced.\n\nFuel System Issues\n\nIssues with the fuel system are also relatively common, but sometimes it can be extremely difficult to figure out exactly which component of the fuel system is to blame for the issue.\nThe fuel system is a complicated network of car components that all work together to provide fuel and, ultimately, enable combustion inside your engine. Issues associated with the fuel system commonly result in loss of fuel pressure.\nA clogged fuel filter is the easiest and least expensive component to replace. If your fuel filter is not able to let enough fuel flow through to the engine, simply replacing it might solve the issue.\nA more severe issue is a failing fuel pump since they are much more expensive to replace and requires significantly more expertise.\n\nIgnition System Issues\n\nUnlike diesel engines which use compression to ignite the fuel/air mixture, gasoline engines rely on a spark plug to set off the combustion cycle.\u00a0 A faulty spark plug could cause a sudden stall though it will most commonly only result in a cylinder misfire.\nFaulty ignition coils, worn-out distributor caps, and severely damaged rotor buttons can all cause spark loss, which as we explained, can lead to a stalling engine. You may experience these issues while driving or when simply sitting stationary when you\u2019ll notice a car stalling at idle.\n\nSensor Issues\n\nIf there\u2019s nothing wrong with your car mechanically, the fault could lie in one of the dozens if not hundreds of sensors scattered throughout your vehicle. The car\u2019s brain, the ECU, relies on data from these sensors to control the engine and prevent catastrophic engine damage.\nThe most common sensor which can lead to your car stalling is the manifold absolute pressure sensor (MAP) or the mass air flow sensor (MAF). Most cars typically have one or the other.\nIt\u2019s the MAP/MAF sensor\u2019s job to measure the air density entering the engine and calculate how much fuel should be used to provide the optimal fuel-to-air mixture based on that data. If this sensor fails completely or provides inaccurate data, the ECU can make the fuel/air mixture too lean or too rich, causing ineffective combustion and a stalling engine.\nOther sensors which could potentially cause your vehicle to stall include the engine coolant temperature sensor and the throttle position sensor which measures the position of the accelerator pedal.\nAlthough slightly less common, a faulty crankshaft or camshaft sensor could also lead to your car stalling, both while driving or when stationary. Additionally, certain issues related to the idle air control valve (IAC) or the throttle body itself can be the reasons behind stalling the engine.\n\nVacuum Leaks\n\nSome cars and car systems rely on vacuum to perform their job effectively and as intended. When discussing a vacuum leak, people usually refer to a leak in the intake manifold that brings in more air than the engine can handle or is prepared for.\nAs you can imagine, an air leak will cause the car to run lean, which means that the mixture inside the engine doesn\u2019t have enough fuel in it to combust as intended. Vacuum leaks are most noticeable at startup, especially in colder climates, where your car wants to run rich for the first few minutes until it gets up to temperature.\nVacuum leaks will give symptoms such as engine misfire, delayed acceleration, and most notably, an extremely rough and choppy idle. All of these symptoms could lead to stalling provided the leak is large enough.\n\nTiming Belt Issues\n\nThe engine uses a drive belt to power the rest of the components and systems, such as the A/C compressor and the power steering pump. If one of these components locks up or freezes, the drive belt won\u2019t be able to go over the pulley smoothly and it\u2019ll encounter a great amount of resistance.\nIf the timing belt doesn\u2019t snap, the engine crank pulley will effectively take the brunt of the force, causing your car to run like it has half the amount of horsepower or completely smothering the engine, stalling your vehicle in the process.\n\nContaminated Fuel\n\nAlthough extremely rare in this day and age, contaminated fuel is something that could cause your vehicle to stall, especially if you\u2019ve just filled up at a gas station you\u2019ve never used before. More often than not, your vehicle will be able to use contaminated fuel but run a little rougher until the next time you fill up. If the contamination is severe enough, you may need to drain the gas tank completely and fill it up with fresh fuel.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Ignition Coil Replacement Cost\u00a0",
        "content": "What is an ignition coil?\u00a0\n\nThe main purpose for an ignition coil is to transform a small electrical charge into a pulse of high-voltage energy that ignites the air-fuel mixture compressed in a combustion chamber. The battery itself doesn\u2019t produce enough voltage for a spark that can dependably light the air-fuel mixture since it\u2019s only 12 volts. On average, an ignition coil will act as a transformer to elevate the spark at the spark plug to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts. If the spark is too weak, the air-fuel mixture won\u2019t burn fully or it night not ignite at all.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTypes of ignition coils\u00a0\n\nEarly models used a conventional ignition coil that used points, then an electronic ignition coil that replaced the mechanical points with a pickup coil. A distributor-less ignition coil also offered a more dependable option and the coil could be mounted on the inner fender.\u00a0\u00a0\nHowever, today\u2019s cars almost exclusively use a coil-on-plug design where the ignition coil fits over the spark plug itself. That means that each cylinder uses its own coil-on-plug ignition coil, so a car with a V6 engine will have six coils in use at all times.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow does the ignition coil work?\u00a0\n\nAlthough designs have changed significantly over the years, the principle of what an ignition coil does has remained the same. It uses electromagnetism to multiply an incoming electrical current to a much more powerful current when it leaves.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s called an ignition coil because it contains a literal coil of wire inside. When power is supplied to the ignition coil, a magnetic field is created that amplifies the incoming power by several orders of magnitude. Then, when the current is switched off, the magnetic field collapses and that charge results in a snappy spark sent to the spark plug.\u00a0\nThe engine control module is responsible for timing when to cut current from each coil, resulting in an ignition sequence that precisely times your engine firing.\u00a0\n\nHow to tell when an ignition coil is bad\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll never need to replace an ignition coil on your car, but if it is necessary, you\u2019ll have symptoms show up. For other issues, symptoms can be intermittent but a failed coil almost always has constant problems. Signs of a bad ignition coil can include:\u00a0\n\nA Check Engine Light. There will be a constant misfire in the cylinder associated with the bad coil, and the Check Engine Light will illuminate with related codes.\u00a0The engine won\u2019t run as well as it did. Effectively, you have a dead cylinder when the ignition coil isn\u2019t working. It can feel like the engine is stumbling or about to stall.\u00a0Your emissions will be higher. Because unburned fuel is being pushed into the exhaust, you may notice a raw fuel smell from the tailpipe or black smoke indicating a rich condition.\u00a0Your fuel efficiency will drop. The other cylinders need to compensate for the issue, so more fuel is consumed as you drive.\u00a0Your engine might not start. Especially if you have more than one bad coil or if you have an older car with a points system, electronic coil, or distributor-less coil, the engine might not fire up at all.\u00a0\n\nYou can often test coil-on-plug ignition coils quickly and easily simply with a scan tool by swapping coils from one cylinder to another and seeing if the misfire code moves along with it.\u00a0\n\nWhat does it cost to replace an ignition coil?\u00a0\n\nThe cost to replace an ignition coil depends heavily on the vehicle you drive. Some common models have coils that are as little as $35 each while others can be $300 or more for a single coil. Labor costs add to the job, and it\u2019s an important step so you correctly identify the faulty coil. The coil is almost always easy to access, so labor doesn\u2019t add much to the ignition coil cost, though it varies by repair shop and the time it takes to diagnose the problem.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou might want to take care of the job yourself to save on labor, and swapping a coil doesn\u2019t take much time or any rare tools. Keep in mind that a Check Engine Light will need to be cleared using a scan tool afterward.",

        "title": "How to Do an Engine Compression Test",
        "content": "What is a Compression Test?\n\nIf your engine loses compression on one or multiple cylinders, problems will follow. From a misfire to a massive reduction in power, there are some severe and complicated problems that can arise. A compression test is by far one of the most basic engine test procedures and starting point to understand exactly what your engine is doing, and where the problem may be.\nThe premise of a compression test is to test each cylinder to see in measured PSI exactly how much compression that particular cylinder is producing. From a single piston lawn mower engine, to a diesel or V8 engine, the process is entirely the same \u2013 measure what the cylinder is producing in PSI. \nUnderstanding a compression test procedure is also understanding what you are trying to achieve, and that is consistency between the numbers of each cylinder, and looking for the outlier, or outliers. If you measure the tire pressure of 4 tires on your car, and the measurement of three of them is 32PSI, but one of them is 15PSI, you immediately know you have an issue with that one tire, and further testing or inspection is needed to determine why. A compression test is much the same. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow Difficult is a Compression Test?\n\nA compression test is simple to learn and only requires a few basic tools. From a mechanical perspective, you will need to know how to properly remove the spark plugs on the vehicle or equipment you are testing and properly disable the ignition system and fuel system, the latter if the vehicle is fuel injected. For carbureted engines, you can choose to disable the fuel supply and run the carburetor out of gas, but most simply perform the test without doing this.\nHow easy it is to perform the test rests solely on the ability to perform the above tasks. A compression test can be done on either a hot or cold engine, or an engine that has been running or not running that you are attempting to diagnose problems with.\n\nHow to Do a Compression Test\n\n1. Get Your Equipment\n\nGather your tools, including insulated gloves (or nitrile) and safety goggles to protect yourself from hot parts and oil sprays. Keep in mind if working around a hot engine to be careful of hot engine parts like the exhaust manifolds. You will also need a good quality ratchet, an extension or two (a long one with a \u201cwiggle joint\u201d is a good idea on V6 or V8 engines), and a suitable spark plug socket \u2013 note that while a regular socket may fit, it\u2019s best to use an actual spark plug socket designed to remove spark plugs. You will need a notepad to jot down your readings and label each cylinder appropriately on your notes.\nA compression tester can be purchased or rented and includes a set of adapters that will screw into the spark plug hole. The adapter has a built in Schrader valve to trap pressure and a special gauge to show the compression readings. The Shrader valve in the adapter traps the compression in the gauge so you can do the compression test without an assistant. The gauge will also have a release button, which releases the trapped pressure after each reading.\nCaution: If you do have an assistant, make sure he/she knows NOT to spin the engine until you\u2019re absolutely ready, and always keep your hands clear of the belts and pulleys. Have paper and something to write with so you can record your readings as you go. Do some research and know how the cylinders are numbered so you can write the readings in order \u2013 you can find this information online if you don\u2019t know. \n\n2. Disable the Ignition and Fuel\n\nWhen performing the test, you don\u2019t want the engine to start during the test. With older vehicles using a distributor, you can disable the coil by disconnecting the positive terminal of the coil or unplugging the coil or coils completely. Avoid simply removing the coil-to-distributor wire as the coil is still charged and can still achieve a grounded spark and shock someone. If you have to remove the spark plug wires, first know how the cylinders are numbered and mark the wires with tape or a Sharpie or both to make sure you don\u2019t cross them while putting them back later. On vehicles with Coil-On-Plug (most modern vehicles) you will simply need to disconnect the coil\u2019s wiring harness as you remove each spark plug, or, you may be able to find a fuse that controls the ignition system.\nFor fuel injected cars, you will need to disable the fuel system. Begin by checking your fuse panel details, either in the owner\u2019s manual or under the fuse box cover and disable the fuel pump by removing the fuel pump fuse or the fuel pump relay if the vehicle is fuel injected. Carbureted engines with mechanical fuel pumps don\u2019t have a fuel pump fuse and will not need to have the fueling disabled unless you choose to do so.\nFinding the fuel pump fuse or relay is easier on some vehicles than others. Once you believe you\u2019ve disabled the fuel pump, verify that you\u2019ve disabled the fuel system by starting the engine until pressure is no longer in the fuel rail. Unless removing the fuse or relay also disabled the injectors and the ignition system, the engine will start initially after the fuel pump has been deactivated but then it will spin without starting as the residual fuel pressure is depleted.\nAt this point, you can listen to how the engine spins to see if one cylinder picks up speed while the engine is spinning \u2013 if so, one of the cylinders could have low compression.\n\n3. Remove the Spark Plugs\n\nUsing the ratchet, any necessary extensions, and the spark plug socket, screw all the spark plugs out. This is important because you don\u2019t want other compression strokes slowing the engine spin during the compression testing process.\n\n4. Get Your Compression Testing Kit in Order\n\nChoose the appropriate gauge for either gas or diesel. A diesel compression test typically requires the removal of the glow plugs and a special adapter for that engine.  Since diesel has a higher compression rating, it uses a special gauge. Screw the correct compression adapter into the glow plug or spark plug hole of the cylinder you plan to test first \u2013 it\u2019s good to start with cylinder #1, but you can do it in any order \u2013 just write down your readings next to the correct cylinder number.\n\n5. Begin the Compression Test\n\nA compression test is performed by then cranking the engine. This will then allow the gauge to read multiple compression strokes from that cylinder. Allow the engine to spin until the gauge has received at least six \u201cpuffs\u201d, then release the key. If the compression gauge is working properly, the needle will indicate the amount of max compression.\nCaution: If you do have an assistant, make sure he/she knows NOT to spin the engine until you\u2019re absolutely ready, and always keep your hands clear of the belts and pulleys. Remember to have paper and something to write with so you can record your readings as you go. Do some research and know how the cylinders are numbered (firing order) so you can write the readings in order \u2013 you can find this information online if you don\u2019t know. Consider using an assistant or remote starter if you\u2019re having trouble keeping track of the reading while turning the key.\nOnce you have a valid reading, record the cylinder number and PSI rating. Most gas engine\u2019s compression should be between 125 and 175 PSI while a diesel will generally fall between 275 and 400 PSI. Remember to write down each of your findings. If one or more cylinders looks to be way off in PSI, you can re-run the test again just to check.\n\n6. Finish the Test\n\nContinue the process of inserting the adapter, cranking the engine, and recording the results for all your vehicle\u2019s cylinders.  If one of the readings is significantly lower, it can indicate a problem with that single cylinder. Multiple low numbers can be a sign of other engine issues. Remember that what you are looking for is consistency. Cylinder pressures should not fall outside of 15-20% of each other, meaning, if you run a test on a V6 engine and come up with 150, 155, 150, 145, 135, and 130, this would fall within an acceptable level of consistency. If you run the test and come up with 150, 155, 90, 90, 135, and 130, this would indicate an issue as the highest pressure cylinder is significantly higher than the lowest pressure cylinder.\n\nDiagnosing Potential Problems\n\nA lack of compression is generally caused by 4 things \u2013 worn or damaged piston rings, damaged valves, improper valve timing, or a blown head gasket. The following can help pin-point possible problems.\n\nIndividual Cylinders being low PSI: If you only have a low reading on one cylinder or the cylinders aren\u2019t adjacent or next to each other, the problem is usually valve or piston ring related. By adding two or three squirts of engine oil from an oil can to a low compression cylinder through the spark plug hole, you can attempt to isolate the possibly of worn rings being the issue. Re-run the test, and if the compression increases once adding the oil, the chances are very likely piston rings are the culprit. Many multi-valve engines and turbo engines can run into issues with bent valves, or burnt exhaust valves, and even the slightest leak in a valve can cause low compression, and usually a misfire.\nAdjacent Cylinders: Two side-by-side cylinders with low ratings could be a blown head gasket. If you notice other symptoms such as milky oil or cloudy exhaust fumes, the head gasket probably needs to be replaced.\nAll Cylinders: When all your ratings are below 100 PSI for gas engines or below 275 for diesel, you may have a valve timing issue. First, be sure the valves are all properly opening and closing and that you do not have a broken belt, chain, or gears. This can be done in most cases by removing the valve covers and inspecting when the engine is cranking, and/or remove the timing inspection cover, which is usually available on any vehicle with a timing belt. It\u2019s not uncommon for a timing belt to skip timing as well, which will yield you improper valve timing. If you notice a lot of blow-by gas coming out of the oil filler cap with the engine running and compression is low, suspect worn out piston rings. In this case, the engine will need to be overhauled or replaced.\n\nKeep in mind that low PSI numbers on any combination of cylinders almost always indicate a problem that should be fixed sooner rather than later.

        "title": "How Much Should a Tune-Up Cost?",
        "content": "What is a\u00a0Tune-Up?\n\nEssentially, a tune-up is a catch-all phrase for inspecting and performing preventative maintenance on the parts of your vehicle that are the most likely to need replacing. The reason why the term is so vague is that what exactly is being checked and what will need to be replaced depends heavily on your car, where you have driven it, and other factors specific to your car and the way you drive it.\nThere are many pros to getting a tune-up, and consistent maintenance on your vehicle will help it last longer and keep the price of overall maintenance down. Failing to keep on top of basic maintenance can result in costly repairs that could have been avoided. Maintaining your vehicle can also help performance and fuel economy.\nWhen you go in for a tune-up, it is likely that one of the components checked will be the air filter. Generally speaking,\u00a0an air filter should be replaced at least once a year, though depending on where you drive your vehicle (for example, if you drive on a lot of dirt roads), you may need to have it replaced more often.\nIf an air filter is not replaced when necessary, the engine will not receive the amount of air it needs to run optimally. This in turn will cause the air-fuel mixture inside of your engine to run rich, which means that it has too much fuel in the fuel-to-air ratio. Not only does this waste fuel, it can potentially cause other parts of your vehicle to fail earlier than necessary.\nIt used to be that when you asked about tune-up prices, you were asking about the cost to replace the spark plugs. Older vehicles typically needed the spark plugs replaced much more often than modern cars \u2013 as frequently as once a year. Although spark plugs last many years longer today, spark plugs should still be checked or replaced if necessary during a tune-up.\nA tune-up should also involve\u00a0looking at the spark plugs\u00a0and cleaning them, but only during intervals with an in-depth inspection or when they\u2019re scheduled for replacement. It\u2019s unfeasible to take them out during every oil change since that would jack up the tune-up cost unnecessarily. If you have an older vehicle with manual ignition, a tune-up may involve looking at the rotor and the distributor cap. Fuel filters may need to be replaced during a tune-up, as well as spark plugs, wires, the PCV valve, or the oxygen sensor.\nAgain, the nature of tune-ups depends on your car. If you happen to have a car that runs\u00a0platinum spark plugs, as is common with most modern vehicles, it is likely they will not need to be replaced as often as the general variety of spark plug found in older vehicles. If you have an electronic ignition, you are not going to need to have a rotor or distributor cap replaced as these do not exist in cars with electronic ignition systems.\nDepending on your situation, a tune-up may also reveal bigger problems with your vehicle that need to be addressed. The mechanic should\u00a0do a check of all your vehicle\u2019s general systems, such as the brakes, clutch, and air conditioning systems. Different cars require different levels of maintenance, so it is important to check your owner\u2019s manual to advise the mechanic to look at certain systems during the tune-up.\nYou may also choose to have an oil change at the time of your tune-up but remember that\u00a0an oil change should happen multiple times a year\u00a0while a tune-up typically only needs to happen once a year or even less frequently.\n\nHow Much Does a Tune-up\u00a0Cost?\n\nYour car tune-up cost depends on multiple factors. The cost of a very basic tune-up will run between $40 and $150 depending on where you are. This variety of tune-up tends to focus on spark plugs alone and\u00a0spark plug replacement. However, if you want a full tune-up involving an oil change, air filter check, distributor cap check, rotor check, PCV valve check, fuel filter check, and all systems getting a cursory examination, this variety of tune-up may cost between $200 and $800.\nThe overall cost of your tune-up will depend on the hourly rate of mechanics in your area as well as the cost of parts that need to be replaced. It is typically cheaper to get a tune-up at a regular repair shop as compared to a dealership.\nIf you happen to have an older vehicle or a classic vehicle, expect to pay more for a tune-up. Particularly if your car is over 120,000 miles, you may be looking at a cost of $500 to $1200 or more depending on what exactly needs to be replaced on the car.\nIt is a good idea to comparison shop before taking your car in for a tune-up. Make sure that when you call the mechanic asking for a price quote that you ask exactly what is included in the tune-up. You may also want to ask about discounts since some shops offer coupons or incentives relatively frequently, particularly for new customers.\nIf you really want to save money, many people do basic tune-ups at home. Keep in mind most cars today have an onboard diagnostic system that can be checked for misfire codes, indicating that spark plugs are worn out or fouled. However, you need a scan tool to check up on them. Basic maintenance of spark plugs and air filters can be done at home for a fraction of the price, though.\n\nWhat are Some\u00a0Signs My Car Needs a Tune-up?\n\nWhile tune-ups should be part of the yearly basic maintenance of your vehicle, there are some signs that your car may need to be taken in immediately for one. If you notice that your average gas mileage has dropped considerably, it is time to schedule a tune-up. Other signs that it is time for a tune-up include a\u00a0lit Check Engine Light, frequent stalling, strange knocking noises coming from the engine, or general lack of performance while driving your vehicle.\n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone",

        "title": "How to Tell if a Fuel Filter is Bad",
        "content": "What Does Your Fuel Filter Do?\n\nNo matter where it comes from, any gasoline that you pump in your car will likely contain natural impurities, deposits, and contaminants that settle in the fuel tank\u00a0and\u00a0could potentially cause damage to parts like the fuel injectors.\u00a0As you might guess, a fuel filter simply acts as a barrier, keeping potentially damaging elements from playing havoc on the rest of your vehicle.\u00a0Since it does undergo a lot of heavy use during the regular lifespan of your vehicle,\u00a0it slowly gathers and holds those contaminants, and eventually, if not attended to, will begin to restrict flow and eventually plug up.\u00a0\u00a0\nHow often to replace a fuel filter can depend on\u00a0a number of\u00a0things. Fuel filters on older cars will often last one and a half to two years, but some can last longer. Some newer cars have \u201clifetime\u201d filters that may be built into the fuel pump and do not need to be replace on a service interval. Check your owner\u2019s manual to determine exactly how long the usefulness of your fuel filter lasts. If you end up with a tank of dirty fuel or start to notice symptoms that indicate the fuel you\u2019re using is no longer being filtered properly, you may have to switch it out sooner than expected.\n\nHow Long Does a Fuel Filter Last?\u00a0\n\nSome but not all cars have a fuel filter element that can be replaced. On gas-powered cars, it\u2019s usually underneath, clipped or bolted to the frame rail. On diesel vehicles, it\u2019s usually in the engine compartment and has the same style as an oil filter. For most cases, the fuel filter needs to be replaced every 20,000 to 30,000 miles, while diesel vehicles often are slightly shorter intervals. The best way to tell your vehicle\u2019s interval is to check the maintenance guide provided along with your owner\u2019s manual.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome vehicles don\u2019t have a replaceable fuel filter. Rather, they have a screen on the fuel pump that filters out particles in the tank, and these filters aren\u2019t serviced unless you\u2019re working on the fuel pump itself.\u00a0\n\nSigns of a Bad Fuel Filter\u00a0\n\nAs fuel flows through the filter, pleated material strains out any contaminants on the way to the engine. It could be dirt, salt, or any moisture or debris that gets kicked into the massive tank when the gas station gets a delivery. When the fuel filter gets full of this material, it restricts fuel flow to the engine. Symptoms are sure to result eventually.\n\nPower loss when under loadCheck engine lights is onEngine runs rough or stallsYour engine won\u2019t startFuel pump quitsDecreased fuel economy\n\nPower Loss When Under Load\nRestricted fuel supply to the engine might allow for proper fuel pressure while the engine is idling. However, when you\u2019re accelerating or pulling a load, the demand for fuel is much greater. A blocked fuel filter prevents the fuel rail from staying full of fuel, restricting the amount of power your engine can produce.\n\nCheck Engine Light is On\u00a0\n\nIf the injectors don\u2019t receive enough pressurized fuel, there may not be enough sprayed into the cylinders to be burned. A \u2018P0171 System Too Lean\u2019 code could be stored in the powertrain control module, triggering the Check Engine Light.\n\nEngine Runs Rough or Stalls\n\nWithout sufficient fuel supply, the engine can stumble or stall while driving or while idling. Think of it like pinching the straw while you try to drink your soda through it. When you close off the straw, you\u2019re unable to keep the flow of energy-producing fluid going.\n\nYour Engine Won\u2019t Start\n\nWhen you turn the key, the fuel pump pressurizes fuel going into the supply line. A clogged fuel filter may prevent fuel from pressurizing the same in the section between the filter and the engine. Your engine may not fire up since it\u2019s starved of fuel, or it might fire up for a second and die again.\n\nFuel Pump Quits\n\nExcessive demand for fuel can create strain on the fuel pump. It\u2019s constantly cycling at peak performance, trying to force fuel into a restricted supply line. It can cause the fuel pump relay to kick off, the fuse to burn, or the fuel pump to quit altogether.\n\nDecreased Fuel Economy\n\nIt might seem counterintuitive, but a blocked fuel filter can actually cause higher fuel consumption. The PCM believes that the air-fuel mixture is lean and, to compensate, commands more fuel to mix with the air being sucked into the engine to get the amount of power you\u2019re commanding from your car. Though it\u2019s not performing as well, you\u2019re burning more fuel than if the fuel was moving at the right volume.\n\nHow Do You Replace a Fuel Filter?\n\nIf you see signs you need to change your fuel filter, then it\u2019s probably time to start thinking about whether you can replace it yourself or if you need some professional help. While the exact process for changing the filter can vary a lot depending on your vehicle, it is possible to switch it out yourself.\u00a0\nRemember, that you are going to be dealing with gasoline, and leaking gasoline once you crack open the fuel line, so exercise extreme caution! Be sure to read your repair manual or consult online how to properly relieve the fuel system of pressure before cracking open the fuel line, or what steps need to be taken to open the fuel system.\u00a0\nThe most common location for a fuel filter is in one of the fuel lines coming from the fuel tank, mounted near the tank on the\u00a0vehicle\u2019s frame. Several are also located inside the engine compartment,\u00a0while others are non-serviceable and located within the fuel pump assembly, in the fuel tank.\u00a0\nMost fuel systems on cars built in the last 20 years have quick-connect clips or unions that hold the lines\u00a0together, and\u00a0hold the fuel filter in-line for a leak-free seal. With the right tools,\u00a0such as OEM 25150 or 24681,\u00a0you can disconnect these fittings. Keep in mind, they can often be tricky to disconnect. If you do not have a lot of experience with fuel system maintenance, it may be best to get help from a professional mechanic, which you can search your area for one of our\u00a0Preferred Shops here.\u00a0\u00a0\nKeep in mind, a fuel filter is made to be a service-interval part, rather than a failure part. Follow your vehicle\u2019s OEM guidelines (check the owner\u2019s manual) on when to change a fuel filter, or, if you\u2019ve purchased a vehicle with over 100,000 miles and no indication the fuel filter has been changed, it\u2019s a great idea to change it.\u00a0The good news is that fuel filters can be a relatively affordable part, especially if you buy the parts and do the work yourself. A new filter can cost as little as around fifteen dollars in some cases, and even if you go to a pro, the costs of a replacement generally stays around $200.\nHow to Check a Fuel Filter\n\nOnce you remove a fuel filter, you can tell whether it\u2019s the source of your problem\u00a0by a simple blow-test.\u00a0\nFirst, attempt to drain all the gas out of the fuel filter the best you can.\u00a0Find the inlet to the fuel filter (should be labeled as either \u201cin\u201d or have an arrow pointing to the direction of the fuel flow) and clean that inlet with a shop towel. \nNow, place a disposable rag or shop towel\u00a0on your workbench, and gently blow into the inlet of the fuel filter, aiming down towards your shop rag on the bench. You should be able to easily blow into the filter without much resistance. With a plugged fuel filter, you won\u2019t be able to. With a heavily restricted or clogged fuel filter, it will be hard. \nRemember, gasoline is gross, doesn\u2019t taste good, and is flammable, so be sure to exercise extreme caution. Leave any rags or towels long enough to dry outside before disposing them, and NEVER throw any old fuel or rags wet with gasoline into the trash.\nKeeping Up with Fuel Filter Maintenance\nFuel filter problems generally\u00a0won\u2019t happen with proper maintenance.\u00a0If you start noticing problems with your engine running strangely and experience loss of power and poor gas mileage,\u00a0the fuel filter is a likely suspect\u00a0on the fuel side, and an easy one to check off and change.\u00a0\nLuckily, a\u202fnew fuel filter\u202fshould not cause too much of a dent in your bank account\u00a0and\u00a0even if you find that it doesn\u2019t solve the issue, you are still replacing a maintenance item that needs to be replaced soon enough.\u00a0Following the recommended change intervals in your owner\u2019s manual is key to maintain optimal vehicle health,\u00a0and in this case, the health of your fuel system. Waiting until you are starting to experience issues with your fuel filter may cause bigger fuel delivery issues to deal with beyond a\u00a0clogged filter.",

        "title": "What Are the Signs of Bad Ignition Coils?",
        "content": "What Do Ignition Coils Do?\nTo generate power, your vehicle\u2019s engine needs the right mixture of gasoline and oxygen. Then, it needs a spark to ignite the mixture. Car batteries only have about 12 volts. This is far shy of the several thousand volts necessary to generate the right type of spark. The ignition coil transforms the battery\u2019s voltage to a level that allows the spark plug to do its job.\nOlder vehicles have a distributor, ignition coil, and spark plug wires. Most vehicles made after the late 1990s typically have a small ignition coil that sits directly on top of each spark plug, which is known as coil-on-plug (COP) design. Regardless, the functionality is the same. When you start your engine, current flows to the ignition coil. The coil, being a compact electrical transformer, then steps up the voltage level from 12 volts to as high as 60,000.\n\nWhere Is a Vehicle\u2019s Ignition Coil?\nThe location of your vehicle\u2019s ignition coil or coils depends on its make and model. Some vehicles have an ignition coil attached to every spark plug on the top of the engine block. Others have a single coil that ignites every spark plug in the engine. Furthermore, you may have a vehicle that has a cluster of ignition coils in a single pack.\nWhy Do Ignition Coils Fail?\nMost ignition coils are durable components, but they are neither indestructible nor designed to last forever. Ignition coils tend to fail because of bad spark plugs or plug wires. If your vehicle\u2019s fuel-to-oxygen mixture is either rich or lean, therefore, your ignition coils may fail prematurely. Additionally, engine heat and vibrations can cause damage to ignition coils. Nevertheless, on most vehicles can go 80,000 to 100,000 miles before requiring an ignition coil replacement.\n\nSigns of a Bad Ignition Coil\n\n1. Illuminated Check Engine Light\n\nWith most modern vehicles, a faulty ignition coil is enough to turn on the Check Engine Light. If you have an OBD-II diagnostic scanner, you may see a P0351 ignition code. Of course, because all cars are different, an ineffective ignition coil may register a different code for the problem. Alternatively, you may see a code for an engine misfire, which could be the result of a dead ignition coil.\n\n2. Misfiring Engine\n\nIf an ignition coil is not working properly, your engine will likely misfire. A misfiring engine results in a jerking or sputtering feel when you are moving at normal speeds. When you stop, a misfire from a bad ignition coil may cause your vehicle to run roughly, vibrate or shake.\n\n3. Hard Starts\n\nTo run, your vehicle\u2019s engine needs a spark at the right time. If a spark plug is not getting the right voltage to create a spark, you may experience a hard start. This may mean the ignition coil is not working properly. While this problem can happen with any coil configuration, it is more common with engines that have a single ignition coil.\n\n4. Worsening Gas Mileage\n\nIgnition coils can either fail completely or fail intermittently. This means that you may have a coil that goes bad over time. Accordingly, even if your vehicle seems to be performing normally, you should watch for worsening gas mileage. Even if it is not caused by a bad ignition coil, decreasing gas mileage is a sure sign that something is wrong.\n\n5. Diminished Power\n\nVehicles with bad ignition coils often run roughly. This means, when your vehicle is idling, you may notice a rough feel or sound. Your vehicle may also experience a drop in power. As a result, a bad ignition coil can make it acceleration more sluggish. The vehicle may even stall.\n\n6. Sudden Backfires\n\nModern engines should not backfire. This loud bang happens when unburned fuel suddenly escapes out of the exhaust system. While there are a few causes of backfires, a failing ignition coil is a common one. Regrettably, if you do not address backfires quickly, they can lead to significant engine damage.\n\nHow Do You Replace a Damaged Ignition Coil?\nMany ignition coils offer a plug-and-play design, making them easy to replace. If your vehicle has this style of coils, even a relatively new DIYer can likely handle the replacement without professional assistance. Still, some coils are hard to access. If you do the job on your own, though, you only pay the parts costs. While the price of replacement ignition coils varies widely, on most vehicles, it ranges from $40 to $300 for parts. If you have a mechanic do the job, you must pay labor costs. These likely depend on the design of your engine and the location of the bad ignition coil.\n\nWhat Is Your Next Step?\nTo keep your vehicle running optimally, you need ignition coils that function properly. Watching for bad ignition coil symptoms is critical. Also, replacing your ignition coils per your vehicle\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s instructions may help you avoid car trouble.\nWhether you need ignition coils, tools, or anything else car-related, AutoZone has your back.

        "title": "How to Replace Ignition Coils",
        "content": "How to Change Ignition Coils\n\n1. Safety First\n\nEnsure the engine is cool, apply the emergency brake, and open the hood. Disconnect the negative battery cable before working on anything else. Note: Check the vehicle\u2019s repair guide first before disconnecting the cable. Some vehicles will react negatively when the battery cable is disconnected, especially for an extended period. A memory keeper/maintainer can be used but check first to avoid electrical damage or other headaches.\n\n2. Remove the Ignition Coils\n\nIgnition coil replacement can be challenging on some vehicle\u2019s engines. The greatest obstacles you\u2019ll face is accessibility and sticking components such as the ignition coil insulator boots sticking to the spark plug and tearing apart during the removal process. Some ignition coils can be difficult to reach and require removal of the upper plenum/intake manifold. In these cases, a new plenum gasket will be needed. Check the Repair Guide for your specific vehicle and engine.\nOnce the ignition coils are located and accessible, carefully disconnect the electrical plastic pigtail connector to avoid damaging it. In some instances, due to age and deterioration, the plastic connector will break. Replacing the connector can be challenging so be prepared and use care. Next, unscrew the coil hold down bolt(s) and remove the coil. A twisting motion is usually necessary to make the insulator boot slide off the spark plug. If it tears away, you will need a pick and/or needle nose pliers to remove the stuck portion from the spark plug. Be careful not to damage the spark plug porcelain as this will cause a misfire and you\u2019ll be right back where you started after the work is completed. If replacing more than one coil, it\u2019s always a good idea to replace each one at a time. If removing two or more at a time, identify each coil pigtail connector with stick on numbers or take a picture beforehand. Once the coil is removed, inspect for oil or antifreeze contamination on the boot and inside the spark plug well. If present, the leak should be repaired to avoid future damage and a repeated failure of the new component.\n\n3. Test Each Ignition Coil with a Multimeter\n\nIf the coils are easy to access, try swapping the suspect coil with another coil on the engine. If the misfire \u201cfollows\u201d the suspect coil to the other cylinder, the coil has failed. If this is not feasible due to limited access, use a multimeter and test the primary and secondary winding of the coil. If you\u2019re not sure how to do this, refer to our guide or drop by your local AutoZone. If you get a reading that\u2019s outside the normal range, you\u2019ll need to replace the coil. The owner\u2019s manual should list the normal resistance range. Now that you know if the coil (if any) has failed, you are ready to install the replacement. Before doing so, it\u2019s a good idea to remove and inspect the spark plug. Again, check for contamination and repair any oil or coolant leaks. Also, check and remove any debris in the spark plug well.\n\n4. Lubricate the Coils Install Them\n\nVerify you have the correct coil. Compare the length and pigtail connections and terminal pins. Then, apply dielectric grease to the inside tip of the replacement ignition coil insulator boot/shield. This will ensure a good seal against moisture and aid removal in the future. Carefully install the coil, pushing it onto the spark plug. Next, re-install the coil hold down bolt and then cautiously reconnect the electrical pigtail. A very small amount of dielectric grease may be used and may be applied to the coil or the pigtail/connector. Ensure the connector fits snugly and you feel the connector tab engage and lock onto the coil.\n\n5. Check Your Work\n\nRe-install the remaining components. Attach the negative battery cable, start the engine, and take your car for a test drive.\nOnce you are certain the problem has been corrected, clear the trouble codes.\n\nIf your vehicle has bad ignition coil symptoms, it\u2019s time for a little do-it-yourself action. Grab the tools needed at AutoZone and make sure to test and replace any failing ignition coils before your vehicle breaks down completely.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "The Tools Needed To Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "When To Change Your Vehicle\u2019s Spark Plugs\n\nWhether you are an automotive enthusiast or just prefer to avoid car trouble, occasionally replacing spark plugs is part of regular maintenance. Put simply, if you ignore your car\u2019s plugs, you are asking for trouble.\nSpark plug manufacturers design their products both to be durable and have a long life. You may not need to worry about your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs for 30,000 miles or more. Still, you should not forget to replace your spark plugs when the time comes.\nAn old, damaged, or ineffective spark plug may cause your vehicle\u2019s engine to misfire. Alternatively, old plugs can cause the emissions from your engine to increase. Even worse, a bad spark plug can leave you stranded somewhere you would rather not be.\n\nHow to Tell if Your Spark Plugs are Bad\n\nIf any of the following applies to your vehicle, it may be time for a change:\nYour owner\u2019s manual recommends changing spark plugsYour car\u2019s engine misfiresYour check engine light illuminatesYour car has difficulty startingYour car accelerates slowlyYour car\u2019s engine idles roughly\nLearn more about bad spark plug symptoms.\nWhile other problems and maintenance issues can cause the above situations to occur, spark plugs are often to blame. If changing your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs does not remedy your vehicle\u2019s engine problems, you may need to do some troubleshooting. Still, swapping out bad spark plugs often fixes issues with your vehicle\u2019s overall performance.\n\nHow To Choose the Right Spark Plug Tools\n\nOn most vehicles, replacing spark plugs is not a difficult project. In fact, you can likely do the job in just a couple hours on the weekend. Nevertheless, you need the right tools to replace spark plugs correctly. While you may run into problems, the following tools are often essential for achieving professional-grade results.\n\n1. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual\n\nBefore you can replace spark plugs, you need to know where to find them and how to access them. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual is an excellent resource. If the manual does not shed sufficient light on the subject, you may want to invest in a vehicle-specific aftermarket manual. Chilton and Haynes have some excellent manuals that give you a step-by-step guide to locating and replacing spark plugs as well as a list of tools to replace spark plugs. \n\n2. A spark plug socket\n\nTo remove spark plugs, you need a spark plug removal tool that grabs and twists the spark plugs inside your vehicle\u2019s engine. Because spark plugs can be in awkward positions, you may also need an extension for your spark plug socket. Choosing one that locks in place may help you avoid the sort of aggravation that occasionally accompanies a spark plug replacement.\n\n3. A wobble socket\n\nIf a standard socket does not work, choosing a wobble socket may be a better idea. Wobble sockets are often essential equipment for removing iridium spark plugs. The wobble socket is also smaller than traditional spark plug sockets, allowing you to access tight spaces easier. If a regular socket simply does not fit into the confined area in which you must work, trying a wobble socket may be a better approach. \n\n4. Spark plug boot puller pliers\n\nOccasionally, spark plug boots fuse with your vehicle\u2019s plugs. If this is the case, you do not want to pull on the wires themselves. Doing so may damage the wires, potentially rendering them unusable after your spark plug replacement. Instead, use spark plug boot puller pliers to gently work boots free. \n\n5. A flexible handle ratchet\n\nSometimes you must be a bit creative to remove spark plugs. If your vehicle\u2019s engine configuration requires you to work in tight or bizarre places, using a flexible handle ratchet allows you to remove spark plugs without standing on your head. Using one in conjunction with a wobble socket may be the perfect solution for removing your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs from areas where space is a premium.  \n\n6. A torque wrench\n\nWhen replacing spark plugs, how much you tighten each plug matters. If you do not tighten plugs sufficiently, you risk a bad connection. Too much tightening, though, can destroy both your spark plugs and your engine. Therefore, use a torque wrench and manufacturer specifications to tighten each spark plug appropriately. \n\n7. A spark plug gap gauge\n\nYour new spark plugs need the correct gap to function optimally. Rather than estimating gap, use a spark plug gap gauge to space your new plugs perfectly. To correctly use the gap gauge, first consult manufacturer recommendations. Then, place the gauge between the plug\u2019s center and its electrodes, lining it up to meet manufacturer specifications.\n\nOther Things You May Need\n\nWhile these items are not necessary to every spark plug replacement, they  can certainly help:\nAnti-Seize Lubricant: If your plugs were really hard to remove, it might be because the previous installer didn\u2019t use an anti-seize product. When you apply this product to the spark plugs before installing them, you reduce the risk of having plugs fuse to engine parts. When using an anti-seize product, though, you likely need to reduce the torque by up to 10% on each plug. Spark Plug Wires: You may be able to reuse your existing spark plug wires after replacing old, damaged or ineffective plugs. Still, your plug wires are essential components. If you notice signs of wear and tear or other damage, replacing spark plug wires when you add new spark plugs is a good idea. Distributor Cap: This part only applies to vehicles that have distributors. Just as spark plugs and wires can wear out over time, your vehicle\u2019s distributor cap may not last forever. After replacing spark plugs and wires, inspect the distributor cap for signs of damage. If you see any, opt for a new distributor cap.\n\nAchieving Success \n\nReplacing bad spark plugs is probably a project you can tackle on a weekend. Before you do, though, you must be sure you have the tools needed to change spark plugs. With a bit of planning and the correct tools, you can achieve success.  \nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Car Tune-Up Checklist",
        "content": "What is a Tune-Up?\nThe term \u201ctune-up\u201d has drastically changed since the phrase was coined during the dawn of automobiles. For over 50 years, a tune-up meant that the vehicle\u2019s ignition system \u2013 breaker points and condenser, were replaced and/or adjusted, a new distributor cap, rotor, and spark plugs were installed, ignition timing was set, and the vehicles carburetor was adjusted and \u201ctuned\u201d (hence the term) for optimal performance. The process was as intricate as tuning a musical instrument \u2013 ignition and fueling had to work in perfect tune with each other for optimal performance, thus the term. \nWith vehicles of old, this was a regular occurrence. As electronic ignition replaced points-style systems, the need was still there for plugs, cap, rotor, and carb adjustments, but ultimately, even that became extinct once DIS (distributorless) ignition systems and computer-based fuel injection became the norm. Today, the vehicle\u2019s engine computer and engine components constantly keep these systems running right where they should. \nToday, at its simplest, a tune-up is a bit of a misnomer \u2013 simply a carry-over word of old to describe any time a host of basic routine maintenance is performed on your vehicle. Regular tune-ups can extend the life of a vehicle and help ensure it is operating at its full performance potential. Typically, when to do a tune-up is included in the regular maintenance section of owner\u2019s manuals.\nTuning-up your car today can mean a lot of things. It\u2019s a good idea to check the car\u2019s filters, belts, hoses, and fluids. Also, it\u2019s a good idea if you don\u2019t know the last time you replaced your spark plugs and/or wires/coil boots, now could be a good time. Many may not need to be replaced, but it will give you a chance to stop small issues that could develop into big problems if left unchecked. If you want to learn how to do some of the repairs listed below, consult one of our How-To articles. If you need more detailed vehicle-specific information, check out our Repair Help guides and diagrams.\nCheck out the list below to find the parts and systems that you should check in a tune-up. You don\u2019t need to do all of these things every time, but it\u2019s always a good idea to make sure these are working correctly.\n\nWhat Does a Tune-Up Consist of?\n\n1. Replace Plugs, Wires, and Other Ignition Parts\n\nThe ignition system consists of\u202fspark plugs, plug wires, coils, and other electrical components that ignite the air/fuel mixture in your combustion chamber. The system has changed drastically over the years, where newer ignition systems require only spark plugs and wires/coil boots to be changed at a certain mileage. Older vehicles, as stated before, can have a distributor cap and rotor, and even older, can have breaker points.\nSpark Plugs\n\nSpark plugs have a metal tip (electrode) that wears down over time from high heat and constant electrical arc.\nA symptom of worn spark plugs is a misfire, when the fuel/air mixture in a cylinder fails to ignite.\nWhen replacing spark plugs, it is highly recommended to use plugs of the original equipment (OE) recommended metal. Consult your owner\u2019s manual, repair manual or the experts at AutoZone to learn which is the recommended spark plug metal is right for you or check out our other blogs on spark plugs.\nBe sure to use a light application of anti-seize on the threads of the plugs prior to installation (avoid getting anti-seize anywhere else but the threads).\n\nIn DIS (distributorless) applications that use one coil for multiple plugs, be sure to use either Double Platinum or Iridium plugs as recommended by the manufacturer.\nIf you need some help on replacing yours, check out our guide on\u202fhow to change spark plugs.\nIgnition Wires\n\nIgnition wires will break down over time and eventually fail.\nSymptoms of a failed wire are rough idle, misfire, performance loss, and eventually a dead cylinder.\nWhen replacing a distributor cap or ignition wires, transfer one wire at a time from the old cap to the new cap. This prevents the ignition system from becoming cross wired, which result in a rough running engine. You can make this job easier by using a spark plug boot tool.\nUse dielectric grease in the boots to help prevent arcing and help make future boot removal easier.\nBe sure that your wires are secure and routed away from exhaust components.\n\nIgnition Coils\n\nCoils transform low battery voltage into thousands of volts. Over time this high voltage electricity wears out the coils out.\nSigns your coils may be worn out include engine misfires, weakened acceleration, rough idle, and reduced gas mileage.\nSome vehicles use coil packs, which are typically located near the valve covers, while others use a coil-on-plug design that are over or close to the spark plugs.\nPut dielectric grease on the boot of coil-on-plug coils.\n\nDistributor Cap and Rotor and Breaker Points (If Applicable)\n\nNumerous rotations of the rotor inside the distributor will cause the metal contact point to wear down.\nA failed distributor cap causes misfires or in more severe cases a non-start.\nWhen performing a tune-up it is suggested to replace both the cap and rotor at the same time.\nTransfer ignition wires one at a time from the old cap to the new cap. This prevents the ignition system from becoming cross wired, which result in a rough running engine. You can make this job easier by using a spark plug boot tool.\nOlder vehicles pre-1974 usually contain breaker-points which need to be adjusted / replaced on a regular basis.\n\n2. Let Your Engine Run Clean with New Filters\n\nFilters in your vehicle consist of: oil, fuel, air, and cabin air filters. Filters keep contaminating particles from reaching vital components in your engine and related systems. Having a clean filter improves engine performance and efficiency. Dirty filters make your vehicle work harder to get the air, fuel, and oil that it needs. This can choke off your engine or decrease the ability to deliver air, oil or fuel at the proper pressure.\nEngine Air Filter\n\nFilters thousands of gallons of air for every gallon of fuel and will clog over time.\nClogged air filters can reduce performance, but not MPGs on fuel injected engines*.\nClogged air filters in carbureted engines can reduce MPG\u2019s by 2-6% and up to 14%*. \nReplacing your\u202fair filter is generally a simple task, check out our\u202fair filter replacement guide\u202fif you need help.\n\n*Based on a testing claim from\u202ffueleconomy.gov\nCabin Air Filter\n\nSome vehicles are equipped with a cabin air filtration system and thus have a replaceable filter element to keep the air inside the vehicle clean.\nA dirty cabin air filter can allow dust, pollen, exhaust fumes and other contaminants into your vehicle\u2019s passenger compartment and restrict airflow into the vehicle.\nMost cabin air filters are easily accessible and take less than 15 minutes to change. Learn how from this\u202fcabin air filter guide.\n\nOil Filter\n\nDirty oil can lead to excessive wear on internal engine components.\nAn oil filter is used to filter vital engine oil of contamination and can clog if not replaced at recommended intervals.\nCan lead to high oil pressure in severe circumstances of clogging.\nShould be replaced with every\u202foil change at recommended intervals. Learn more from\u202foil change guide.\n\nFuel Filter\n\nDirty fuel and contaminated fuel tanks can clog your fuel filter and lead to low fuel pressure, sometimes resulting in hesitation while accelerating or rough idling.\nCan lead to premature fuel pump failure in severe circumstances.\nShould be replaced with every\u202foil change at recommended intervals.\n\nPCV Valve\n\nOver time the Positive Crankcase Ventilation Valve can become clogged by carbon build up.\nFailure can cause the engine to consume oil at a much faster rate, cause poor fueling conditions, misfires, and actually blow out gaskets due to pressure accumulating in the crankcase.\nThe PCV Valve is usually easy to replace. In many cases, it can be swapped out in a matter of a few minutes.\n\n3. Keep Your Auxiliary Systems in Check with New Belts and Hoses\n\nBelts connect the pulleys of your accessory drive system which transfer the rotating force of the crankshaft pulley to the\u202falternator, water\u202fpump, power steering pump, and other systems. Hoses transfer vital fluids throughout the engine. Over time, belts and hoses wear down due to the elements they are exposed to such as heat and cold as well as the constant use they see with day to day operation of the vehicle. They eventually wear down, glaze over, turn brittle, crack and even break.\nSerpentine Belt\n\nThe serpentine belt rides in a series of pulleys on the front of your engine.\nThe belt wears down, and needs replacement because of exposure to heat and stress.\nInspect the belt(s) for cracks, fraying, glazing or fluid contamination. Any of these conditions can cause the belt to slip or break.\nIf you need help changing the belt out, check our\u202fserpentine belt replacement guide.\n\nBelt Tensioner\n\nThe belt tensioner maintains the correct belt tension.\nA weak belt tensioner will cause premature belt wear.\nA \u2018tight or sticking\u2019 belt tensioner will cause premature wear to the water pump and other accessory bearings.\nWith the belt off, rotate the tensioner through its arc of travel. It should move smoothly and provide firm tension.\nWhile the belt is off check the idler and tensioner pulley, plus accessory pulleys for proper alignment and smooth rotation \u2013 if any roughness or noise is detected in any pulley \u2013 replace it at this time.\n\nTiming Belt\n\nThe timing belt controls the internal mechanical timing on many engines. This belt usually has an 80,000 \u2013 100,000 mile life cycle, and then must be replaced, along with any tensioner or idler components that run the belt.\nWhen a timing belt breaks on most vehicles, the piston can and will come in contact with valves that are stuck open which causes catastrophic damage.\nThe timing belt is an intricate job, and should be replaced on the recommended mileage intervals.\nWhen inspecting your timing belt, take the time to check the cam and crank seals for leaks.\nSome vehicles feature a\u202ftiming chain\u202finstead of a timing belt. Timing chains typically do not need to be replaced as often, and usually have a much longer life cycle, although tensioner components which keep the chain tight can fail.\n\nHoses\n\nRadiator hoses and heater hoses circulate coolant through the engine and the radiator to expel the heat absorbed.\nMost hoses are made of rubber and will break down over time. You can find out of it is time to replace your hoses by inspecting them for swelling, bulging, or leaks. When the engine is cool, squeeze the hoses to feel for hard spots and soft spots.\nCheck the hose clamps for damage or loss of tension too. You don\u2019t want one to let go while your engine\u2019s hot.\nIf a hose were to fail, the engine could overheat. Overheating can cause serious, sometimes irreparable damage to the engine.\n\n4. Maintain Your Car with the Right Fluids\n\nEngine oil, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, and power steering fluid are necessary for your vehicle to operate properly. Contaminated fluids can lead to excessive wear on internal components. You can save money in the long run by servicing these fluids before expensive damage occurs. Regular change intervals exist for each type of fluid and as such, they need to be replaced at recommended service intervals, find out more by consulting your owner\u2019s manual or by visiting Repair Help.\nMotor Oil\n\nAs oil circulates through your engine and is exposed to heat and pressure, the oil will become contaminated.\nAn oil filter will keep large particles from being recirculated, but will not keep the oil from providing a protective barrier of lubrication.\nReplace the oil filter during an oil change.\nOil should be replaced at manufacturer recommended mileage or time intervals, consult your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nCoolant\n\nYour cooling system keeps your engine from overheating in the summer and prevents your engine from freezing in the winter.\nCoolant will eventually break down and become contaminated which results in degraded flow and the fluid\u2019s ability to fight corrosion.\nFlushing your cooling system with a flush product specifically designed to remove deposits regularly will improve the performance of your cooling system.\nAlways refer to your owner\u2019s manual to determine the recommended coolant for your vehicle. Different manufacturers require the use of different types of coolant and using a fluid other than what\u2019s specified by the manufacturer can result in engine damage.\nBe sure to mix the coolant with the correct amount of water or use a pre-mixed product that\u2019s ready to pour in.\nShould you decide to change your coolant, check out our\u202fcoolant flush and fill guide.\n\nBrake Fluid\n\nBrake fluid is a vital fluid in your vehicle, without it you would not be able to stop.\nDOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid are hygroscopic, which means the fluid will absorb moisture from the air. This added moisture lowers the fluids ability to operate efficiently as a hydraulic fluid and causes internal corrosion in the braking system.\nDark or muddy looking fluid is a sure sign of hygroscopic contamination.\nIt is recommended that the brake fluid be changed out for fresh fluid and the brake system bled to ensure that new clean fluid is flowing throughout the entire system.\n2 years is the recommended changing interval. Learn how to do it yourself with our\u202fguide on how to bleed brakes.\n\nAutomatic Transmission Fluid (ATF)\n\nAutomatic transmissions use friction packs, along with gearing to operate, which in turn needs a fluid to regulate that friction. This creates a ton of heat and results in wear of internal components and contamination of transmission fluid. This wear and tear makes it imperative to follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for transmission fluid and filter change.\nBrown transmission fluid is an indication that the fluid needs to be changed but, if the fluid is muddy or smells very burnt, do NOT change, instead, take your vehicle to a professional for a professional diagnosis and opinion on how to proceed.\nBe sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual for recommended change intervals as well as the correct fluid type to be used.\n\nPower Steering Fluid\n\nOver time contamination can cause wear to the power steering pump.\nBe sure that your power steering fluid does not appear muddy and is between the MAX and MIN levels in the reservoir.\nBe sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual for recommended change intervals as well as the correct fluid type to be used.\n\nYou can get great benefits from performing a tune-up on your vehicle. It\u2019s one of the best ways to maintain original performance. In fact, fixing a car that is badly out of tune can give a noticeable boost to both engine performance and fuel economy*. A vehicle running in top shape today prevents and lessens costly repairs tomorrow. AutoZone\u2019s tune-up guide will show you the common parts that are replaced when tuning up a vehicle such as spark plugs, plug wires, air filter and fuel filter. It\u2019s also a great time to check other components under the hood such as belts, hoses, and fluids.\nConsider purchasing a repair manual or\u202fregister on AutoZone.com to view free repair guides\u202fthat give information on how to replace these parts as they relate to your vehicle\u2019s specific needs.\n*In vehicles with major emissions issues or carbureted vehicles.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "How to Test Ignition Coils",
        "content": "Types of Ignition Coils\n\nIgnition coils come in various types of ignition systems, but all of them take energy from the battery (usually 12 volts) and convert it to a high enough voltage (50,000 volts or more) to create a spark. Depending on the type of coil you have, this voltage either travels from the single ignition coil into a distributor, from the coil itself into a spark plug wire, or in the case of Coil-On-Plug (COP) systems, the coil sits directly on top of the spark plug. Older vehicles with a distributor have a single coil which provides voltage to the distributor. DIS, or wasted spark systems, use what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccoil pack\u201d to send voltage to each spark plug wire, where other vehicles use a single coil for each spark plug wire. Most newer vehicles now incorporate COP.\nRegardless of how many coils your vehicle has, you\u2019ll need some basic tools to properly test a coil:\n\nA basic tool kit to remove coils\nA multimeter or an ohmmeter\nSpark plug or ignition tester\n\nIgnition coils fail in 2 ways \u2013 either complete failure and lack of output, or intermittently, meaning, the coil gets weak, output gets low, or the coil sometimes works and sometimes doesn\u2019t. Because of this, intermittent problems are more difficult to diagnose. You\u2019re going to want to do your initial diagnosis by looking for common bad ignition coil symptoms, because you need to remove the coils before testing them. That way you can save yourself some time if you find that the symptoms don\u2019t match up. These are the symptoms of a bad ignition coil:\n\nMisfires \u2013 Check Engine Light: Misfiring is usually the first and most common symptom, and in most vehicles today, this will appear as a Check Engine Light. The misfire will either be on a particular cylinder, or random. Most of the time, specific-cylinder misfires become easier to diagnose than the random-cylinder. If the car is running rough, stumbling, or lacking acceleration, and a check engine light code is revealing a misfire, an ignition coil or coils may be the culprit.\nRough Idling or Hesitation Under Load: As stated before, most ignition problems that are misfires also cause a rough or bad idle, but in cases where a vehicle (mostly older vehicles) does not have a Check Engine light or ability to detect a misfire, a rough idle or constant stalling of the vehicle may indicate a bad ignition coil, or a coil that is over-heating, whereas hesitation under load could also be a sign of a weak coil.\nNo-Start Situation: When a vehicle has a no-start situation, especially on older vehicles, the ignition coil is the first thing some people turn to. This often is not the culprit, as there are many other pieces of the ignition system, but even on modern vehicles, there are cases where a coil can fail between the last run cycle and the next start-up. In these cases, the vehicle may have ran fine, then on the next start, suddenly either won\u2019t start, or runs horribly. Either way, the ignition coil, or coils could be suspect.\n\nTesting Ignition Coils\n\nCommon Check Engine Light Causes: Ignition Coils\nThere are several key things to know first about testing ignition coils. For one, there are many different methods for testing them, some low-tech and others high-tech, and we will cover them all. \nIt\u2019s important again to remember that most coil failures are intermittent, which make them more difficult to diagnose. It\u2019s also important to note that many ignition systems, most notably DIS or \u201cwasted spark\u201d coil pack systems, and several COP systems use a processor, or \u201cIgnition Module\u201d to properly power and send signals to the ignition coils. While these issues may appear that the coil isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s actually the Ignition Module causing the problem. Below we will highlight several different methods for diagnosing coil issues.\n\nHow to Test Ignition Coils\n\n1. Swapping Coils\n\nSwapping the ignition coil with another known, good unit on the car is the easiest and simplest way to begin diagnosis and works extremely well on any vehicle with single coils, multi-packs, or Coil-on-Plug.\nAs mentioned before, in these cases, you will usually have a misfire on a particular cylinder. In this case, let\u2019s say you have a cylinder 3 misfire on a vehicle with Coil-on-Plug packs. Simply remove another coil \u2013 say \u2013 the coil from cylinder 6, and swap with the coil from cylinder 3. Now, if you have a code reader, you can clear your engine codes. If not, take note of which engine code you had. \nNow, start the vehicle and run for several minutes. If the ignition coil was indeed faulty, you will now see an engine code for \u201cMisfire \u2013 Cylinder 6,\u201d as the defective coil from #3 was moved to #6. Your next step is to pull the #6 coil you just moved and replace. \nIf you swap these coils and still have a misfire on cylinder 3 and it doesn\u2019t move, you know the coil is not the suspect. You either have an Ignition Module issue (some COP units use a module, some don\u2019t), an issue with the coil\u2019s connector or lead, you have a spark plug issue, a fuel injector issue, or mechanical internal engine issue with that cylinder.\n\n2. General Inspection\n\nOn any coil \u2013 look it over carefully for signs of cracks, burns, melting, or leakage in older canister coils. This often points to a problem on its own, so check carefully.\n\n3. Test the Windings with a Multimeter\n\nTesting coils with a multimeter for Ohm\u2019s resistance has been around for a long time. While it works to some degree, a major issue is that you are not able to simulate load, or measure the coil during operation, so weak coils that are not performing may still pass this test, but still be bad. \nNonetheless, testing the coil\u2019s windings for proper resistance can help you find potential problems. Each ignition coil consists of two separate coils wrapped around each other: the primary winding and the secondary winding.\n\nCheck your vehicle\u2019s specific repair manual, or online to find out what the correct resistance reading should be for both the primary and secondary windings. Both must be tested.\nConnect the multimeter\u2019s positive and negative leads to the corresponding terminals as instructed for testing Primary and Secondary windings. Different coils will have different touch-points depending on how the coil is designed. Your repair manual, or online information should tell you exactly where and which pins to touch off to.\nCheck the reading on the multimeter and compare it to the resistance specifications for both the primary and secondary windings.\n\nIf the reading falls outside the normal resistance range, you\u2019ll need to replace the ignition coil. A zero means the coil shorted internally. An excessively high reading means the coil is open. Double check the placement of your leads to be sure they are correct.\n\n4. Spark Test or Active Analysis\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that many times when a coil fails, it becomes weak. It still produces spark, and may still run the vehicle fine at times, but often under load, or acceleration, it can produce a misfire. Other times, the coil completely fails and stops working altogether. Doing an actual, on-vehicle spark test or output test is sometimes the only way to validate what is going on without simply replacing parts and hoping. It\u2019s worth noting, that with any Coil-on-Plug vehicle (COP), that the ignition coil swap highlighted in step #1 is usually the quickest and easiest way to determine you have a coil problem.\nA spark test or active analysis of the coil\u2019s operation while on the vehicle can be performed with a number of different tools or procedures. Keep in mind, with any of these, you are often going to be testing the coil\u2019s output while the vehicle is running, so review any spark test procedures either in a repair manual, or online tutorial. Simply yanking off coil wires while the vehicle is running can result in you getting shocked or seriously injured. You can also research a method known as the \u201cpower balance test\u201d to help isolate where you have a cylinder issue. We will highlight several different style coils and basic methods of how you can test those, along with the tools for doing so:\n\nAn inline ignition tester like OEM 25227 can be helpful. This unit runs inline with many spark plug wires and/or coils and gives you a window to see active spark.\nAn ignition spark tester like OEM 25069 takes the place of a spark plug \u2013 is grounded to the engine and can easily show you whether a particular wire or coil is providing spark.\nThere are several new technology items, like a COP or coil on plug testers, which use inductive technology to tell that a coil is firing properly without even removing the coil. There are also several small, affordable oscilloscopes, along with tutorials online and on youtube on how to use them, that show you how you can pinpoint bad coil output without even removing the coil or wires.\n\nNow, let\u2019s cover different types of coils, and diagnostic methods to pinpoint an issue.\n\nCoil-on-Plug (COP): You will recognize these coils immediately as they sit directly on top of the engine\u2019s valve or cam cover, are bolted down, and attach directly to the spark plug via a rubber boot. The easiest and best method to pinpoint a problem on these coils is to do the #1 method of swapping the coil with a neighboring coil to see if the misfire moves to a different cylinder. If you suspect the coil is dead, you can also remove the coil, plug it back in, and use an ignition spark tester like OEM 25069 to determine if the coil is firing. You can also use a multimeter to test resistance. Individual coils for each cylinder that attach with a spark plug wire, similar to the LS motors used on Chevy and GMC trucks, can also follow this method.\nDIS (Wasted Spark) Coil Packs: Coil packs were the norm of ignition systems for well over 2 decades. These units use either a single pack or series of packs that have tower terminals that spark plug wires hook to. They often have pairs of the terminals that fire in unison, where one cylinder fires on the compression stroke and one is wasted on the exhaust stroke of another cylinder, giving it the name \u201cWasted Spark\u201d ignition. They are usually powered and controlled by an Ignition Module, which can also fail. Sometimes, a pair of terminals can go out on the pack, and other times, just a single terminal running a single cylinder can fail. If your system is composed of several of the same packs (like a V6 engine with 3 packs, each having 2 terminals) you can also do the #1 \u201cswap\u201d method and move the coil pack to a neighboring position, and see if the misfire moves to those cylinders. You can also test with an ignition tester like OEM 25227. In this case, it\u2019s good to compare the intensity of the spark with a cylinder you know is good and working properly, with one that\u2019s suspected of being bad. If you notice the spark is considerably weaker, the chances are the coil is bad and needs to be replaced. There are also methods of testing the windings on these coils with a multimeter, but they can get complex as you have multiple terminals and towers to test.\nTraditional Single Coil: The single-terminal \u201ccanister\u201d coil has been around in one form or another since the 1920\u2019s. While they are not used on vehicles today, there are millions still on the road in vintage vehicles which use a distributor. Testing these coils for resistance via a multimeter is a good start, along with doing an inline spark test to be sure the coil is firing properly. Keep in mind, many of these coils can suffer intermittent problems, especially from overheating or vibration and your resistance test will not necessarily lead to a proper conclusion. Luckily, most of these coils are rather affordable, and often times if you are dealing with a pesky intermittent problem and all testing hasn\u2019t led to a conclusion, swapping the coil with a known good unit may be the best course of action.\n\nDiagnosing coils or the ignition system can sometimes be difficult. Simply swapping parts to diagnose the problem can sometimes be costly and ineffective. Professional shops often have a series of expensive, state-of-the-art equipment to help with these processes, and often giving them an opportunity to diagnose the problem ends up being more cost-effective and less time consuming.

        "title": "Common Ignition Problems",
        "content": "Common Ignition Problems\n\n1. Faulty Ignition Coil, Spark Plug, or Spark Plug Wires\n\nAn ignition issue can be caused by a faulty or failing ignition coil, spark plug, or spark plug wire set. These critical components of your ignition system keep your engine running smoothly. If they have a problem, you\u2019ll notice a rough ride, engine misfires, and possibly decreased gas mileage, along with in most cars, a Check Engine Light (CEL) for a misfire.\nOften times, replacing the failed or failing part will correct this issue.\nIgnition coils and wire sets are fairly straightforward to replace. However, some applications will require removal of major components such as the upper intake plenum manifold. Reference a repair guide for more specific information for your vehicle. We highlight how to properly test your ignition coils, or troubleshoot problems here.\nSpark plugs may require a bit more attention on some vehicles. Some can be very easy to get to and replace, where other ones are a long, complex job depending on their location. We have a guide on replacing spark plugs. Some spark plugs need to be gapped and have anti-seize applied before installing and some do not. Check the spark plug manufacturer\u2019s requirements. \n\n2. Crank Position Sensor Failure\n\nAny modern ignition system that doesn\u2019t use a distributor has to have a method at which to determine the precise moment to fire the ignition coils. To do this, a crank position sensor is used, which is essentially a magnetic trigger. At the precise moment in revolution, the sensor picks up a trigger point in the rotating crank, and sends signal. When this sensor fails, this signal is lost. Sometimes, it the part fails completely and you have either a dead vehicle on the road, or a no-start situation. Other times, the problem can be intermittent, leading to misfires, or stalling issues. In most cases, when this occurs, the vehicles engine computer will pick up a code for crank position sensors.\n\n3. Cam Position Sensor\n\nLike it\u2019s cousin, the crank position sensor, a cam position sensor does the same thing on the engine\u2019s camshafts, or multiple camshafts. These devices read the position of the cam in respect to ignition timing, to either advance (make the spark come earlier) or retard (make the spark come later) in the stroke. \nWhen a cam position sensor goes awry, you can experience much of the same issues \u2013 misfires, lack of power, poor gas mileage, or a no-run / no-start situation. Like most sensors, it\u2019s also picked up by the vehicles engine computer, so if there\u2019s a fault, an engine code will pick it up.\n\n4. Distributor Pick-Up Coil / Hall Effect Sensor\n\nVery similar to a crank position sensor, in distributor-style ignition systems that do not use breaker points, each distributor has a pick-up coil, or hall effect sensor (same thing) that reads a cog wheel inside the distributor to accurately pick up and tell the precise moment when to send a signal to the coil to fire. \nWhen a pick up coil goes out, you generally have a no-start situation. Many people often think this is the ignition coil, but often times, the pick-up coil is the culprit. Changing these coils can be difficult, because often, the distributor must be completely removed to gain access to it.\n\n5. Ignition Module\n\nMany vehicles made in the last 10 years no longer use a proper Ignition Module, and instead house its function either in each individual coil, or in the vehicles onboard computer. Ignition Modules were the standard for many electronic ignition systems from the late 70\u2019s all the way through the early 2000\u2019s. Many foreign vehicles refer to the unit as a power output stage control, or ignition control unit, but they are all the same thing. \nThese devices help process the signal from a crank position sensor or pick-up coil in a distributor system and distribute the signal of when the coil should fire. When they go out, you can have a misfire, coil packs not functioning properly, or a no-run / no-start situation.\n\nPinpointing an issue\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, that there are a multitude of other sensors and situations on a vehicle not related to the above scenarios that can cause a misfire. Fueling, vacuum, engine timing \u2013 to name a few \u2013 can also cause issues that will need to be investigated. Remember on any of these components to always carefully inspect the electrical connectors and related wiring for shorts or potential problems before changing parts.

        "title": "What Kind of Spark Plugs Do I Need?",
        "content": "What are Spark Plugs\n\nDifferent Types of Spark Plugs\n\n1. Copper Spark Plugs\n\nCopper plugs have been around for over a century and have a solid copper core with a nickel alloy electrode. Nickel is softer than platinum or iridium, and thus has a much shorter life. These plugs are usually best for older, low-voltage systems. Because of copper\u2019s high conductivity, some high performance\u202fvehicles require them.\n\n2. Platinum Spark Plugs\n\nPlatinum plugs became popular in the late-80\u2019s, when ignition systems began to migrate from distributor-based systems, to coil pack or DIS (wasted spark) systems, which demanded a plug that could withstand the higher-energy, more demanding system. The harder, platinum material lasted longer, as manufacturers made a push to develop spark plugs and antifreeze that lasted upwards of 80-100K miles. Platinum plugs use a platinum disc that is welded to the end of the center electrode, which allows the plug to last longer than a copper plug, retaining its edge better, which means better conductivity. Platinum spark plugs tend to run hotter, preventing fouling and buildup of deposits. It\u2019s important to note that DIS \u201cwasted spark\u201d coil systems operate best on Double Platinum Plugs. Learn more about these related issues in our ignition systems article.\n\n3. Double Platinum Spark Plugs\n\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, DIS \u201cwasted spark\u201d ignition systems were created, which essentially means that one coil pack controls the firing of two spark plugs in the system. In doing this, both spark plugs that attach to that single coil pack spark at the exact same time \u2013 the difference is that one is firing on the compression stroke, and one is firing on the exhaust stroke of the sister-cylinder, which is referred to as a \u201cwasted spark\u201d. To make this even more complicated, one spark plug attached to each coil is positive polarity, while one is reverse polarity. This means that the spark on one plug travels from the center electrode to the side electrode. On the other plug, the spark travels from the side electrode to the center electrode. What this means is that instead of the center electrode wearing as it does in traditional ignition systems, now, the side electrode wears on the plug that is reversed-polarity! This created the need for a double-platinum plug that has a platinum disc on both the center electrode, and the side electrode. This created a plug that is very durable in DIS systems, lasting upwards of 80-100K miles. You don\u2019t want to install single platinum plugs if your owner\u2019s manual recommends a double platinum spark plug. Granted, the plug will work, but will wear prematurely and not perform as well.\n\n4. Iridium Spark Plugs\n\nHarder than platinum, Iridium plugs came on the market in the mid-2000\u2019s as coil-on-plug systems began to get more popular. Iridium plugs usually feature the smallest diameter center, which can increase efficiency by reducing voltage needed to create a spark. Iridium is also famous for continuing to fire under extreme conditions. If your manual specifies iridium spark plugs, best practice is to absorb the extra cost associated with this rarer metal for best performance.\n\n5. Double Iridium Spark Plugs\n\nLike double platinum spark plugs, double Iridium spark plugs feature two discs of rare metal for increased performance and durability. Double Iridium Spark Plugs are designed to deliver the firepower necessary under any driving conditions, especially extreme heat or continual high-speeds, and can provide up to 4 times the normal life of service compared to a standard copper spark plug.\n\nWhat Kind of Spark Plugs Do I Need?\n\nThe different types of spark plugs can seem overwhelming at first, but the simple way to find out what kind of spark plug you need is by checking your owner\u2019s manual. The manual will specify the right plugs for your vehicle. Another way to check is to enter your vehicle\u2019s information on AutoZone.com, or by checking with a parts specialist at your local AutoZone store.",

        "title": "What are Bad Spark Plug Symptoms?",
        "content": "Signs to Tell If Your Spark Plugs Need to Be Replaced\n\n1. Visual Inspection\n\nRemove and compare your old spark plugs to a new one. If the tip and/or electrode show excessive wear they should be replaced. Also, look for fuel and oil contamination. If contamination is found, the spark plugs should be replaced. However, additional inspection is needed to determine the cause of the contamination whether it is caused by oil, fuel, or coolant. Failing components within the engine itself can cause oil or coolant contamination. Fuel contamination can be caused by failing components within the fuel, ignition and/or emission systems.\nPro Tip: The following are symptoms that may occur with worn spark plugs. Keep in mind, there may be other issues causing the problem. Be sure and do a complete inspection before replacing any parts.\n\n2. Trouble Starting\n\nIf you are experiencing what seems to be longer cranking times, especially on a cold morning, you\u2019ll want to look at your spark plugs and related ignition and fuel system components. Over time, spark plugs develop residue from unburnt gases and oils, which reduces your car\u2019s performance and makes cold-starting more difficult. Tough cold starting is not only bad for your engine, but can also drain the battery and increase starter wear and tear.\n\n3. Rough Idling\n\nIf your vehicle\u2019s engine is running rough or noisy when idling, you likely have a problem in your ignition system. Heavy rumbling when waiting at a stoplight or in a drive-thru may indicate your car is overdue for maintenance. It may be a spark plug issue, but it could just as easily be another component like ignition coils causing the problem. Inspect the system and determine if the spark plugs or something like the ignition coils and wires need to be replaced. Make sure that you diagnose the issue before you go about replacing parts, otherwise you could end up wasting time and money.\n\n4. Misfiring\n\nMisfires are hard to miss, as the engine will shake so badly that you\u2019ll feel the vibration throughout the car. Misfiring results in poor performance, reduced fuel economy, increased emissions, and rough idling. Replacing spark plugs may help with this issue but, as above, inspect the system first.\n\n5. Decreased Fuel Mileage\n\nLow gas mileage is a subtler sign of worn spark plugs. Deteriorated spark plugs can account for as much as a 30-percent loss in fuel economy, which you\u2019ll definitely feel at the pump and your wallet. If you\u2019ve checked and determined the fuel mileage has dropped, check your spark plugs and related items for signs of wear.",

        "title": "How to Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "HOW TO CHANGE SPARK PLUGS\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and ensure the engine is cool. Clean the engine area of any dirt and debris to prevent anything from falling into the engine cylinder during spark plug replacement. Additionally, you may want to disconnect the battery (negative post only). Check the vehicle repair guide or other resources to ensure no damage will occur if the battery is disconnected for any length of time or if any modules or other items would need to be reprogrammed. Ensure the positive and negative terminals do not become crossed with a foreign object such a hand ratchet and cause a dangerous short circuit.\n\n2. REMOVE THE SPARK PLUG WIRE\n\nFirst, remove any interference items. If your vehicle requires removal of the upper intake plenum, a new gasket will be needed. After gaining access, you will likely find the rubber spark plug wire end and inside metal terminal somewhat difficult to remove from the spark plug. You must be careful to avoid damaging the rubber boot or tearing the wire terminal away from the plug wire end. If you discover the plug wire boot is \u2018stuck\u2019 to the spark plug try using spark plug wire pliers to aid in removal. The boot may need to be twisted back and forth to break the bond from the spark plug. Again, be careful. The metal terminal that connects to the spark plug inside the boot must be removed simultaneously with the boot to avoid damage. If damage to the boot or wire occurs, don\u2019t feel bad. In many instances, even a professional is unable to remove them without damage occurring. If damage does occur, the wire(s) must be replaced. Re-installing a damaged boot or wire will cause a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the spark plug wires are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. A new plug wireset will ensure the newly installed spark plugs will receive all the necessary firepower from the ignition coil(s).\n\n3. REMOVE THE COIL ON PLUG (COP)\n\nCOP designed coils attach directly to the spark plug end and use a long rubber insulator boot. Start the removal process by disconnecting the electrical connector from the ignition coil. Press down or pull up on the locking tab to make the connector release so it can be disconnected. A small screwdriver may be needed to help depress the locking tab. Once the connector is off, remove the hold down bolt and carefully twist the coil about a quarter turn or so back and forth until the \u2018bond\u2019 is broken. Then it should pull straight up and out. Use caution! There is always a risk of damage to the COP boot. COP coils and their insulator boots are made of plastic and rubber that protect and insulate the high voltage conducting materials inside. Damage will cause the high voltage to leak (short) to ground causing a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the boots are damaged they must be replaced. Just like spark plug wires, if they are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. Check the COP boots for signs of engine oil or engine anti-freeze contamination. Oil puddled in the spark plug well hole is usually caused by a valve cover tube seal and/or leaking O-ring. The appearance of coolant in the plug well can be caused by a leaking heater or by-pass hose or even the intake manifold gasket. These leaks should be repaired first, especially if severe, to prevent damage to the new components.\n\n4. UNSCREW THE SPARK PLUG\n\nBe sure the engine is cooled off. Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs. Avoid thread damage by following these suggested steps. On COP applications remove debris by blowing air down into the spark plug well hole. Even the tiniest of particles can build up in the threads of the spark plug during removal and cause damage to the cylinder head threads. If this occurs, sometimes a spark plug thread restorer tool may be used to do just that, restore damaged threads in the cylinder head. Next, loosen/turn the spark plug about a half a turn counter-clockwise and blast a small shot of penetrant fluid to the base/ thread area of the spark plug. Allow a few minutes to soak. On some engines, the manufacture may provide additional removal steps. Check the repair guide. Take note it you feel considerable resistance while turning the spark plug counter-clockwise. You may need an additional small amount of penetrant and soaking time. If you encounter resistance, turn the spark plug clockwise and carefully work it back and forth. If the plug just won\u2019t co-operate, you should probably stop and seek a professional\u2019s help. Damaged cylinder head threads can often be expensive to repair, depending on your vehicle.\n\n5. PUT IN THE NEW SPARK PLUGS\n\n6. RE-INSTALL THE SPARK PLUG WIRES OR IGNITION COILS (COP)\n\nApply a small amount of plug wire grease to the plug wire boot (or COP boot) and re-install each plug wire or ignition coil. Be sure and connect the plug wires to the appropriate spark plug for each engine cylinder (refer to a firing order diagram if necessary). Re-install the coil hold down bolt(s). Re-attach the electrical connector(s). Re-install all other components removed to gain access. Be sure and gather up all tools and the engine is free and clear to start. Remember to re-connect the battery if it was disconnected at the beginning.\n\n7. START UP THE ENGINE\n\nStarting the engine after the spark plug replacement is a good way to validate your work. Note: If your Check Engine Light is on, you can drive your vehicle to your local AutoZone store and have the code translated. If the Check Engine Light \u2018flashes\u2019 there is a cylinder miss-fire. Re-check your work. Do not drive the vehicle very far if the engine is missing as the\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0could be damaged.\nYou may need to\u00a0gap your spark plugs\u00a0before installing them. Some plugs come pre-gapped, and if this is the case it will say so on the box. Otherwise you\u2019ll need a gap tool to gap your new plugs according to the specifications in your owner\u2019s manual. Most modern cars use plugs made from long-lasting materials, so you might only need to do a spark plug replacement once or twice over the time you own a vehicle.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "Best Car Air Fresheners: Buying Guide 2023",
        "content": "Types of Car Air Fresheners\n\nGenerally, there are four different categories of car air fresheners on the market. They include:\n\nHanging air fresheners. These car fresheners hang over rearview mirrors and are often shaped as trees, cartoon characters, or animals. They typically contain a pad soaked in a scent that emanates into the air when they\u2019re open.\nSprays. Aerosol or pump sprays atomize a fragrant liquid that can cover up bad smells or neutralize them. They\u2019re a more immediate solution and can be re-sprayed as often as you\u2019d like.\nVent clips. These clips can be attached to your dashboard\u2019s vents or on a visor and release a light scent while the air is flowing.\nSolid air fresheners. These solid car fresheners are small cubes that have a pleasant smell and slowly release fragrances over time, often lasting for up to four weeks.\n\nThere are also liquid diffusers that can be used with essential oils. A small heater warms the oil-and-water solution.\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Car Air Freshener\n\nThe type that suits you best varies depending on your needs. You should consider a few different things like:\n\nA commercial or natural option. While air fresheners are considered safe, some artificial scents aren\u2019t as pleasing as natural options like essential oils.\nConvenience. Vent clips are non-intrusive where you might have to give up a cupholder or rearview mirror visibility with other options.\nPrice point. Some products are extremely inexpensive where others are more costly, even if they\u2019re your preferred option.\nVisual appeal. Hanging trees can make your interior feel cluttered, and some options are packaged more discreetly than others.\nSafety. Some air fresheners like gels can stain your interior if they spill while others are pet-safe, child-safe, and non-spillable.\n\nBest Car Air Fresheners\n\nLittle Trees Gold Air Freshener 3-Pack\n\nYour favorite hanging air fresheners have a classy black-and-gold look with Little Trees Gold air freshener.

The small, low-profile can fits neatly in a cupholder or under a seat with a grippy lid that converts to a base.

        "title": "Tips and tricks on how to clean your leather car seats",
        "content": "How often should you clean your seats?\n\nThere are several factors that impact the overall cleanliness of your seats and how often you should clean them. If you live in a hot climate, your perspiration will cause body oils to seep into the seating surfaces on a daily basis and you\u2019ll need to clean them more often. If you use your vehicle for work, there is the constant transfer of work-related dirt and grime to the vehicle, including the seats, and if you have kids, it is just a matter of time before they do some redecorating in their part of the car.\nAll the oils, greases, and other liquids that adhere to your seats attract more dirt, and pretty soon you have layers of filth accumulating on all the seating surfaces, so it\u2019s a good idea to clean them regularly. Schedule a one-per-year cleaning, but if you can see dirt or grime accumulating before then, it\u2019s not a bad idea to perform a preemptive cleaning and avoid more damage to the material.\n\nHow to Clean Leather Car Seats: Vacuum, spray, scrub, protect\n\nLeather is a great material for car seats because they see a lot of abuse, and leather is a naturally resilient material. Plus, most leather seats in cars today have a coating that lengthens their lifespan and makes cleanups easier. Most spills can be addressed immediately and wiped clean, to avoid setting a stain, and it pays to keep a spray bottle of leather detailer in your trunk for those cases.\nWhen it\u2019s time to do a comprehensive cleaning of the seats, follow these steps to get the best cleaning and protection for your seats.\n\n1. Vacuum\n\nThe first step is to remove all the loose debris from your seats, backrests, and even areas like the center console, which is usually leather surfaced. Use a vacuum with a fine tip to get into all the cracks, depressing the folds in the upholstery to release any stubborn particles. You can even use a small brush, or even a toothbrush, to agitate the material and release all the little stuff for your vacuum to suck up. If you have access to an air compressor, you can use it to blow those microscopic Cheerios pieces from the hard-to-reach places, too.\n\n2. Spray\n\nOnce you\u2019ve removed all the loose debris, it\u2019s time to get at the grime that is left behind and you will use a leather cleaner for that. Start by spraying the entire surface that you intend to clean with your leather cleaner. Allow it so sit for a moment, before wiping it off with a clean microfiber cloth. Microfiber cloths work great for this application because the tiny fibers trap the dirt, oil, and grime in the cloth, but be aware that you don\u2019t want to reuse a dirty microfiber cloth to polish something that is shiny because all the dirt in the cloth can scratch a smooth surface.\n\n3. Scrub\n\nIf you find that there are stubborn stains, you may need to work the leather cleaner into the material with a brush before removing it with your microfiber cloth. Allow the spray to break down the soil for a minute before getting to work on it.\n\n4. Protect\n\nThe final step in caring for your leather seats is protection. You\u2019ll want to use a leather conditioner that protects without leaving a greasy feel or residue, and you definitely want the product to have UV protection, to block out harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.\nSpray the entire surface of the seat with leather conditioner and work it in with a soft brush, or if the product is not in a spray format, use a brush to apply it. Let it soak for a while so that the leather can absorb the nutrients from the conditioner and then buff it out with a microfiber cloth before it dries. You\u2019ll see a big difference in the sheen of the material once you have completed this part of the process.\n\nWhat products work best for leather car seats?\n\nAutoZone also has many other leather cleaning and conditioning products available, if these do not suit your application. The important thing is to take the time to clean and protect your car leather, so that it lasts over the long haul.\n\nHow to protect your cloth car seats\nUse the same steps to clean your cloth seats but use an automotive upholstery cleaner spray or foam and consider using a wet or dry vacuum to suck out all the residue, for a deep clean that you won\u2019t get just by rubbing out the cleaner. For all your seat cleaning needs, remember the following process:\n\nVacuum all the loose junk out of the seats\nSpray or apply seat cleaner with a brush\nScrub the cleaner into the seat material to agitate all the dirt and grime out of the seat\nWipe the seat clean with a microfiber cloth, or use a wet-dry vacuum on cloth seats\nProtect the seat with a high-quality leather conditioner, or fabric protector for cloth seats\n\nRegardless of what your seat an upholstery material is, you can buy AutoZone leather cleaner or other cleaning products to keep your car looking and smelling fresh and clean.",

        "content": "How often should you clean your seats?\nThe best way to clean cloth car seats is to have a weekly and monthly approach to maintaining their look. Each week, you should likely make time to vacuum the seats to remove any crumbs, dust, or dirt. Depending on how often you drive your car, you may also want to treat stains each week.\u202f\nHowever, if you do not use your car a lot, it may make sense only to do thorough cleanings once a month.\n\nWhat products work best for cloth car seats?\n\nBefore you clean your car seats, it\u2019s best to have the necessary products read to go. You should grab an oxygen-based bleach to help pre-treat any stains. Next, you should acquire a car fabric cleaner like the highly rated Tuff Stuff Multi-Purpose Foam Cleaner Spray or Turtle Wax Power Out! Upholstery Cleaner to clear out the dirt, grime, and stains attached to your seats.\u202f\nLastly, you\u2019ll want to use a spray-on fabric protector to coat your seat and prevent stains from setting into your fabric car seats. The Chemical Guys Total Interior Cleaner and Protectant Spray is a great option to protect all surfaces \u2014 including cloth \u2014 against dirt and stains.\u202f\u00a0\nThese products can help you clear away stains that are impacting the aesthetic look of your seats and protect them from future damage.\n\nTips on How to Clean Cloth Car Seats: Vacuum, spray, scrub, repeat\n\nNow that you have an idea of what you\u2019ll need to start, it\u2019s time to go over the process. Here are the steps for how to clean your cloth car seats.\n\n1. Vacuum your Seats\u202f\n\nStart the process by vacuuming your cloth seats to remove dust, dirt, and any crumbs. This step will clear the way for you to begin using the cloth seat cleaner for your car and avoid pushing these materials further into your car\u2019s fabric.\u202f\u00a0\n\n2. Do a Pre-Treatment\n\nThis extra step will make it easier to get rid of stains. Combine oxygen-based bleach with a small amount of water, and spread it over any stains. Leave it for an hour to allow it to begin lifting the stain off your car seat\u2019s fabric. A powder will likely form that you can vacuum or brush away in preparation for the next step.\u202f\u00a0\n\n3. Spray the Car Fabric Cleaner\n\nBe sure to look at the car fabric cleaner\u2019s directions before getting started, as it\u2019ll likely include instructions on whether you need to mix it with warm water and how much water you need to use per gallon. Take the formula and water blend and put it in a spray bottle for easy and effective distribution. Then, lightly spray it over your seat. If you encounter some stubborn stains, allow the formula to sit for a few minutes.\u202f\u00a0\n\n4. Scrub the Stain\n\nGrab a microfiber cloth or a brush and carefully scrub the stain to ensure the cleaner is fully rubbed into your car\u2019s fabric. Also, be sure to wipe away any excess moisture to avoid oversaturating your seats.\u202f\u00a0\n\n5. Repeat the Process\n\nStart from the beginning, and continue this practice for your other seats and any other stains in your car. Once you\u2019re done, let each seat air dry.\u00a0\n\nHow to protect your cloth car seats\n\nNow it\u2019s time to preserve the cleanliness you\u2019ve worked so hard to produce. Grab a fabric protector to spray onto your car seats. This action will prevent any dirt, grime, or crumbs from settling into your car\u2019s seats. This product protects the look of your car seats and helps diminish the amount of work you need to do in the future to clean your car seats.\n\nYou can walk away with a professional-grade look without taking your car to the dealership.\nVisit your local AutoZone to check out our selection of car fabric cleaners today to ensure the interior of your vehicle looks as good as new!",

        "content": "Introduction to Car Interior Cleaners\n\nAlthough there\u2019s pride in driving a clean vehicle that\u2019s showroom-ready, there\u2019s much more to it than that. Dirt and grime can speed up wear and tear in your car quickly. Sand, dust, and dirt act as aggregates, and when they rub against your carpet, upholstery, or trim, they cause wear and scratches.\nThink about where you rest your heel on the floor mat as you drive. If there\u2019s dirt on your shoe or on the mat, it will rub through the carpet fibers much faster than if it\u2019s cleaned regularly. The same goes for other surfaces in your car too, whether the driver\u2019s seat or dashboard. Some particles can be corrosive or caustic too, eating into the surface they\u2019re on.\nHigh-quality cleaners trap these particles and neutralize them, preparing them to be wiped away.\n\nHow to Choose the Right Cleaner\n\nAnd not all cleaners are useful for every job, which is why you have separate sprays for cleaning leather than you do glass. Soft surfaces such as vinyl, some plastics, and leather can dry and crack if an incorrect cleaner is used. An all-purpose spray might be great for hard surfaces but won\u2019t leave a streak-free finish on the glass like a dedicated glass cleaner will. Always use the correct cleaner for the job or you risk either doing the job again or even damaging your car.\nAnd, choosing the right cleaner may be about preferences too. Some drivers may love the fresh scents that are available in car interior cleaners. But if you have a sensitivity to odors or you simply prefer a neutral, fresh smell, there are many unscented products you can choose from too.\n\nProtectant Wipes\n\nArmor All Extreme Shield Protectant Wipes\n\nArmor All has been making some of the best car cleaning products for as long as most of us can remember, and they have an extremely highly rated product in their\u202fExtreme Shield Protectant\u202fwipes. With 25 wipes per container, you have the perfect convenient and disposable tool for touching up surfaces when you get to the show. Great for wiping away dirt, dust, and lint, they even contain a UV blocker to protect your vinyl, rubber, and plastic surfaces from harmful sunlight.\n\nMeguiar\u2019s Supreme Shine Protectant Wipes\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to spend just a little more, you can step up to the\u202fMeguiar\u2019s Supreme Shine Protectant\u202fwipes that include Scotchgard, a high-tech product that 3M developed to protect fabrics and other materials from spills.

Proper interior detailing involves more than just wiping surfaces; it requires a thoughtful approach and attention to detail.\nWhen using concentrated cleaners, follow the recommended dilution ratios. Too much product can leave residue, while too little may result in ineffective cleaning. Before applying any cleaning product to a visible surface, test it in an inconspicuous area to ensure compatibility and avoid potential damage. This precaution is especially crucial when dealing with sensitive materials like leather.\nInvest in quality detailing brushes, microfiber cloths, and applicators. These tools are designed to reach into crevices, lift dirt, and prevent scratching. Avoid using abrasive materials that may harm surfaces over time.\nExcessive use of liquid cleaners or water can lead to mold, mildew, and unpleasant odors in your vehicle. Be mindful of the amount of moisture applied, especially in areas prone to water retention. When you\u2019re cleaning, ensure proper ventilation. This not only helps products to dry faster but also prevents the inhalation of fumes. Open doors or windows and, if possible, clean in a shaded area to avoid quick evaporation of cleaning solutions.\nElectronic components within your vehicle, such as screens and buttons, require specialized care. Use electronics-friendly cleaning solutions and soft, lint-free cloths to avoid damaging delicate surfaces.\nConsider applying protective coatings or treatments to surfaces like leather and fabric to repel stains and spills. This preventive approach makes future cleaning more manageable and extends the life of your interior materials. As well, prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fading and damage to interior surfaces. Use sunshades or park in shaded areas whenever possible to protect your vehicle\u2019s interior from UV rays.\n\nGet Ready For Car Season\n\nAutoZone interior cleaning products are easy to search for and purchase, so don\u2019t waste any time getting your ride ready for the next car show or get-together.

        "content": "What you should be looking for to find the right car vacuum\u00a0\n\nAs you begin your research, you should factor in a few features to find the best car detailing vacuum for you.\u202f\u00a0\n\nDo you have pets? \u2013 Pet hair can be tricky as it can get stuck within your upholstery, making it hard to get rid of. As a result, you\u2019ll need a vacuum cleaner with an effective suction ability to easily remove pet hair.\u202f\u00a0\n\nDo you need a wet/dry car vacuum? \u2013 Do you frequently handle liquid within your car? A wet/dry car vacuum allows you to clean up both wet and dry stains.\u202f\u00a0\n\nDo you prefer a corded or cordless car vacuum? \u2013 Both options come with pros and cons. A corded vacuum will limit where you can park and clean your car, but it can handle more extensive and longer cleaning jobs. On the other hand, a cordless car vacuum can clean your vehicle practically anywhere. It may also be easier to maneuver as these vacuums tend to be portable. However, you\u2019ll have to charge the battery sufficiently.\u00a0\n\nHow lightweight is it? \u2013 A heavier vacuum can likely handle more extensive cleaning jobs, but it will not be as mobile, which will limit where you can clean your car. Alternatively, a smaller car vacuum will be more lightweight, but it may not be able to take care of large messes in one sitting.\u202f\u00a0\n\nHow much suction does it have? \u2013 If you have a history of having heavy-duty messes in your car, you want to make sure you have a car vacuum with considerable suction.\u202f\u00a0\n\nHow effective is the air filter? \u2013 You want to focus on cleaning the materials within your car, but you also want to ensure the air within it is as clean as possible. For this reason, you want to consider whether the vacuum has a high-efficiency particulate air or HEPA filter.\u202f\u00a0\n\nThese points can help you narrow down the right car vacuum to look into.\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe Best Car Vacuums to Clean Your Car\u2019s Interior\u202f\u00a0\n\nNow that you have an idea of the features you need to consider for your next car vacuum, check out our picks for the best car vacuum cleaner to elimnate those crumbs and dirt within your car.\u202f\u00a0\n\nWagan Wet/Dry Auto Vacuum 12V\u00a0\n\nPrice: $26.99\u00a0\n\nIf you need an affordable and portable car vacuum cleaner, the Wagan Wet/Dry Auto Vacuum 12V should be high on your list. It comes with a 120W motor and a 9-foot power cord. However, this product shines because it can be powered with a cigarette lighter receptacle in your car. Bonus! This car vacuum can inflate those pool toys if you\u2019re heading to the beach. Reviews for this one highlight its size and relative power.\u202f\n\nProElite 14.8 Volt Rechargeable Car Vacuum\u00a0\n\nPrice: $31.99\u00a0\n\nAt 2.1 pounds, the ProElite 14.8 Rechargeable Car Vacuum is a lightweight vacuum that packs a punch. This vacuum can be recharged, making it a cordless car vacuum option. With a rating of almost 4 out of 5, this vacuum has shown to be primarily effective for customers who have used it. Reviews highlight the vacuum\u2019s compact size, suction, and portability. If you need a lightweight and easy to hold car vacuum, consider this one.\u00a0\n\nArmor All Utility Vacuum 2.5gal\u00a0\n\nPrice: $46.99\u00a0\n\nThis car vacuum delivers on offering an exceptional product for an affordable price. The Armor All Utility Vacuum comes with an eight-piece detail kit that includes components that enable you to get those crumbs between the seats and clean out the dashboards, vents, and electrical components. The car comes with a nozzle that allows you to reach tight spaces and an automatic shut-off feature to prevent overflow. While it is corded, its power makes up for the lack of mobility. With a rating of 4.6 out of 5, the reviews for this one highlight the vacuum\u2019s thorough cleaning ability and suction.\u202f\u00a0\n\nDewalt 20 Volt 1.5gal Wet/Dry Vacuum Cleaner\u00a0\n\nPrice: 180.99\u00a0\n\nThe Dewalt 20 Volt 1.5gal Wet/Dry Vacuum Cleaner allows you to have the best of both worlds. It offers the power of a corded vacuum in a cordless form. It comes with an extended runtime battery, a flexible hose and front utility nozzle, and a HEPA wet/dry filter that catches 99.97% of dust. While it is almost 4 out of 5 stars, reviewers highlight how helpful the vacuum is for individuals who need convenience in dealing with more giant messes \u2014 particularly individuals that drive with children or people who have jobs that produce dirt and grime in their car.\u202f\u00a0\n\nDewalt Dust extractor\u00a0\n\nPrice: 499.99\u00a0\n\nIf suction and a good air filter are important to you, then the Dewalt Dust extractor is a great option. Weighing in at 27 pounds, this car vacuum is more prominent in size and price, but the trade-off may be worth it. Coming with a 15 AMP motor, this car vacuum cleaner\u2019s airflow facilitates significant suction power. The vacuum\u2019s eight-foot power cord and wheels make the 27-pound size easier to maneuver around.

        "title": "How Your Car's Interior Heating System Works",
        "content": "Your Car\u2019s Heating System\n\n Luckily, internal combustion engines have no shortage of heat, so the air that is brought in through the duct can pass by a heater core. The heater core is essentially a small radiator that is filled with hot coolant from the car\u2019s engine cooling system. The airflow passes over this heater core, allowing for heat exchange that cools the core while heating up the air before it reaches the cabin interior.\n\nThis might seem very straightforward at first, and it certainly is efficient, but the system gets more complicated when it comes to regulating temperature. Without some mechanism to do this, your car\u2019s interior temperature would depend on how hard the engine was working. The two most common ways that cars regulate temperature are by using a water-valve or air-blending. The valve method is more common on older cars, and has a valve that allows more or less hot coolant into the heater core depending on the desired interior temperature. Air-blending systems keep the heater core at full operation, but keep the temperature within a desired range by using flaps that can let in cold outside air to mix with the heated air.\n\nWhy is My Car Heater Not Working?\n\nHaving your car blow cold air in the winter is terrible, and in some climates in can be downright unsafe. Common causes of a car heater that\u2019s not working include:\n\nLow Coolant: If there\u2019s not enough coolant in the car, the heater core might not be able to get enough hot coolant in it to heat up the cabin air. Check this one first, because it is comparatively easy to top off the coolant. Also, air pockets in the coolant system can cause your heater core to not get a proper supply of coolant. This happens often when coolant is flushed and replaced without\u00a0properly bleeding the system, which needs to be done on certain vehicles to remove these air pockets.\nBad Blower: This one\u2019s also pretty easy to diagnose. If your car gets hot, but won\u2019t blow that hot air, you may need a new blower fan motor. To make sure, check the fuse, blower motor resistor, and wiring first including the ground circuit.\nFaulty Thermostat: If your car\u2019s temperature gauge stays on C well into operation of the engine, you might have a non-working thermostat. Some cars won\u2019t divert hot coolant to the heater core until the engine has heated up. For a lot of reasons, it\u2019s important to replace the thermostat ASAP if it is not working.\nClogged or Restricted Heater Core: Coolant that is not changed frequently enough gets contaminated, and this contamination can cause corrosion or clogs in the heater core. Make sure to check every other possible cause first, installing a new heater core can be a time-consuming DIY job or an expensive professional one.\nStuck Blend Door / Actuator:\u00a0Inside the dash, you have a blend door that shuts off the airflow to the AC side of the system and opens the heat-side, or vice-versa. There are also a series of actuators that help open and close the blend door, or various directions that the air flows (like defrost as opposed to the floor or vents) The blend door can become stuck, or actuators fail, causing air not to flow through the heater core properly.",

        "title": "How to Clean Your Car's Interior",
        "content": "How to Clean Your Car\u2019s Interior\n\n1. Remove All Items\n\nThe first thing that you are going to want to do when you begin to\u202fclean out the interior of your car\u202fis to ensure that you clear out all of your belongings. Some folks practically live in their vehicles, which means that trash can accumulate. If you are driving around with children in tow, the situation can get messy fast.\nMake sure that you remove everything from the interior of the car that is not attached. This includes trash, gym bags, children\u2019s toys, magazines, or anything else that is in there. You may find it advantageous to have a trash receptacle and a recycling bin near the car while you are doing this. Also, remove the front and rear floor mats. Now is a great time to hose them down. Even if they are carpeted floor mats, then can be soaped, scrubbed, and hosed off. Hang them over an outdoor chair or somewhere in the sun for several hours to dry out.\n\n2. Vacuum\n\nOnce you are done removing everything, you can begin the vacuum process. Regardless of whether you start in the back floors or front, move the front seats all the way forward, or backward to gain the most space to vacuum. Don\u2019t forget the trunk or cargo area. Many cars present challenging nooks and crevices, especially along the edge of the door that are tough to fit a vacuum or Shop Vac extension into. \nOne tip is to make your own custom hose tool by attaching a length of smaller heater hose (like 5/8 size) or vinyl hose and taping it around a vacuum extension piece. Then, whenever you need to tackle these tough crevices, install your custom hose, and have the ability to clean tight spots.  \n\n3. Interior Detailing\n\nNow it\u2019s time to start your car\u2019s interior cleaning. Using some basic\u202fcleaning wipes or glass cleaner, you can start wiping down the dash, instrument cluster, and center console. \nMost center console units that have cup holders will have a way to remove either the holders, or the entire section, which can then be cleaned in the sink with soap and water. This is best to remove spilled drink residue and grime. \nFor small cracks, vents, and tough to reach spots, you can use detailing brushes, an old toothbrush, or cotton swabs to clean. \nOnce your plastic dash and interior pieces are clean, these can be treated with interior shine, such as Meguiar\u2019s Supreme Shine interior detailer. Use a microfiber towel or applicator pad to apply the detailer.\nAfter you are done with cleaning the plastic pieces of the interior, you can move onto the interior windows. A\u202fmicrofiber towel\u202for good old paper towel will work well here. Some folks even swear on old newspaper (yes, it\u2019s a thing!) You can go ahead and spray the interior windows with window cleaner and use the towel to get a streak-free shine. If you have tinted windows, make sure that you follow any cleaning instructions that came with them, so you do not accidentally ruin the finish. Don\u2019t forget the inside of the back window, which is often neglected.\nLast, you can address your upholstery. If your seats are cloth, they can be cleaned with either a foam cleaner or a small portable carpet cleaner. If you happen to have leather seats rather than upholstered ones, you can clean them with treatments used specifically for cleaning and conditioning leather, like Lexol products. Make sure to test your preferred cleanser out on a small area to ensure that it does not affect the coloring or feel of the leather. \n\nOnce you are done with all of this, make sure that you leave time for your car to air out. It is likely that you will have used multiple cleaners inside of the car, and while you probably commonly use these cleaners in your house, the small interior of your car will make the smells more overwhelming. Leaving your car doors open for a bit so that the smells can dissipate will make your car a more pleasant place to be.\u00a0\nFinally, you may wish to finish with an\u202fair freshener\u202fif you like to use these in your vehicle.\u00a0\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere is no one best way to clean a car\u2019s interior, but the overall process can be very simple. A few hours of your time on a lazy weekday can help make your car a much more pleasant place to be for the rest of the work week.\nDon\u2019t forget: the more often you clean your car, the less time it takes! Consider how much time you spend inside your vehicle, and it\u2019s easy to see how that time can go a long way to more pleasant times down the road.",

        "title": "How to Select, Install, and Clean Floor Mats",
        "content": "Everything You Need to Know About Floor Mats\n\n1. What type of floor mat should I buy?\n\nFloor mats are cut into three sizes or \u201cfit types\u201d: universal fit, trim-to-fit, and custom fit.\nUniversal Fit mats are designed to fit just about any vehicle. So just take them out of the package and put them in the right place after cleaning the original interior.\nTrim-to-Fit mats have extra rubber around the edges that can be trimmed with scissors or a heavier blade to fit your interior more precisley. Put trim-to-fit mats in your interior to see where the best trim mark is, then cut along the appropriate groove. Once it\u2019s cut, go ahead and install as you would an universal fit mat.\n\n2. What floor mat material should I get?\n\nRubber and Vinyl mats provide all-weather protection, trapping debris and dirt that could potentially ruin the interior of your car, truck, or SUV. Rubber and Vinyl mats are also the easiest to clean. While vinyl mats will get the job done, rubber ones are made from a higher-quality material, last longer, and usually look better.\nCarpet mats look great and are pretty comfortable. Carpet may not be as resistant to moisture as the rubber mats, but their tough, nylon materials are simple to clean and stand up to a moderate level of punishment while still protecting your natural interior and factory mats.\nCarpet and rubber hybrid designs give a nice mix of style, comfort, and protection. Some mats, like faux-leather, provide basic protection while making your interior look really cool.\n\n3. How do car floor mats stay in place?\n\nGood floor mats are designed not to move around and stay in place after being installed. This is an important safety feature. To make sure the mat you\u2019re installing will hold secure, just check the back of the mat you\u2019re buying for pegs or holders that will ensure the mat is locked in while you\u2019re getting in, getting out, and driving.\n\n4. What\u2019s a heel pad on a floor mat?\n\nA heel pad provides extra protection where your heel sits while your foot is on the accelerator. This area of your floor mat gets used the most and is the fastest to show wear. If you\u2019ve got a heavy foot, wear particularly thick shoes, or just plan on using the same mats for a while, a heel pad is a feature you\u2019ll want to look for.\n\n5. How to install car floor mats the right way\n\nLet\u2019s walk through how to put the mats inside your car. \n\n Remove original mats from the floorboard and make sure the area is vacuumed. \nPlace mats on the ground to examine where the openings are located to latch onto your car. If your vehicle or mats don\u2019t have latches, skip this step and the next one. \n Align to corresponding openings. \n Take a step back and double check that the mats are straight and aligned correctly.\nYou did it! Your interior now has an addiotional protective layer. \n\n6. How to clean your car floor mats to look great and last longer\n\nFloor mats will get dirty, but cleaning them is relatively simple. Keeping mats clean will help them last longer, help you enjoy time in your vehicle, and anyone who rides in your car will notice. \n Remove the mats from the car and give them a good shake and place them on the ground.  \nCleaning carpet floor mats (or carpet sections of a hybrid mat) \n\n A vacuum and a stiff bristle brush make this job simple. \n Remove the mats carefully, not spilling and dirt or debris onto the natural interior or factory mats underneath.\n Give the mats a good shake to get loose dirt and debris off, then set the mats on the ground. \n Use the vacuum to to collect any dust or dirt. \n As you\u2019re vacumming, use the brush to scrape off anything trapped in the carpet and collect it with the vacuum. \nDouble check for remaining dirt or stuck debris.\n If you see any dirt on the back or front, repeat the first step until it\u2019s gone. \nPlace all mats back inside the car and you\u2019re all set. \n\nHow to clean rubber or vinyl floor mats\n\n Remove the mats carefully, not spilling any dirt or debris onto the natural interior or factory mats underneath. \n Give the mats a good shake to get loose dirt and debris off, then set the mats on the ground. \nThe shake should help with removing dirt and debris, but rubber and vinyl mats can also be cleaned with some spray car carpet cleaner, a bristle brush or even a garden hose. \nIf you\u2019ve got a hose, rinse off the mats. This will remove grease and dirt (or whatever else) trapped on the mats. \nWhile the mats are wet, spray them with your cleaner. Let the cleaner maneuver through ridges, groves, and grips for a deep clean. \nUse the bristle brush to scrape off any oil, grime, dirt, or whatever else might be there. Rubber mats are pretty durable so you can put some elbow grease into it if you have to. \nRinse the mats and let them air-dry in the shade. If you\u2019re in a rush, use a microfiber towl to dry the mats quickly. \n Check to make sure the interior under and around the mats is clean. If it\u2019s not, use a vacuum and bristle brush to clean up any dirt or debris. Then install the mats back in your vehicle.\n\nInstalling and maintaining floor mats will help keep your vehicle\u2019s interior clean and improve the quality and comfort of your time in the car.

        "title": "How to Protect Your Car's Interior in Winter",
        "content": "Keep The\u00a0Trash Out\n\nOf course, it is a good idea to ensure that your car does not become a garbage disposal during any season of the year. However, winter is an especially bad time to leave food wrappers, papers, and other debris on the floor of your car. This is because while a mess on its own merit is never pleasant, a mess that is also mixed with slush and snow and mud and wet leaves is even worse.\nIf you do not have a dedicated place to put trash in your vehicle, now is the time to designate one. There are several products on the market that can hang on the back of your car seats to act as a small trash can. Some people also recommend using plastic kitchen containers with lids as miniature sealable trash cans.\n\nKeep The\u00a0Inside Dry\n\nWhether it tends to rain or snow more where you live, when you get into the inside of your heated vehicle it\u2019s likely that the exterior of your coat is going to be wet during inclement weather. This dampness is easily transferred onto the upholstery in your vehicle. This becomes especially problematic if you have fabric upholstery as the upholstery can absorb this dampness and this can lead to unpleasant odors in your vehicle.\nMuch of the time the vehicle can dry out overnight. However, if you find that a musty smell is permeating your vehicle, vacuum out, and nullify any smells with an\u00a0odor neutralizer. You may also wish to invest in a seat protector if this is a common problem.\n\nKeep the\u00a0Vacuum Running\n\nOf course, vacuuming the inside of your car should be part of regular maintenance, but the importance of this is paramount during the winter months. Your boots are likely to attract various forms of salt over the course of the winter, and this can be very bad for your carpets and upholstery. Make sure to vacuum underneath any rugs that are in your car as well as under the seats and in the trunk.\n\nKeep Those\u00a0Wipes Handy\n\nIf you happen to have a leather interior to your vehicle, the cold winter air can dry it out. It\u2019s a good idea to have a stash of conditioner wipes on hand to ensure that your leather interiors get exposure to natural oils and conditioners to keep them in good condition.\nAdditionally, dashboards and car controls happen to be really germy places. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so be sure to keep some antibacterial wipes in your glove box as well. This way you can give these germ hideouts a good wipe down when necessary. Especially if somebody sneezes in your car you want to have these on hand.\nAnother form of wipe you may want to keep on hand are for your windshield. Foggy windshields are an unfortunate reality of winter driving conditions, and it\u2019s second nature for most people to reach forward and clear out a spot for visibility when this occurs. However, this can leave smears on the window, which can lead to dangerous visibility conditions. If the sun comes down at the exact wrong angle from the sky, streaks on the windshield can result in the driver being blinded by sunlight.\nTo this end, You may wish you keep a demister pad to wipe your windshield when necessary. It\u2019s smart to clean your windshield once per week with basic window solution to keep your view as unobstructed as possible.\n\nKeep Your\u00a0Carpets Covered\n\nIt is probably no surprise that the biggest focus of how to keep car interior clean in winter is carpets. Particularly if you live in an area with rough winter conditions, it\u2019s likely that you are going to unintentionally track in snow, slush, and rock salt all winter long. This can be very difficult on your carpets.\nThe best way to prevent your carpets from being ruined by winter is to protect them. Purchasing floor mats for your vehicle is a smart way to protect your carpets. The best kind of floor mats are flexible and rubber and are in a deep tray style. These are impervious to wetness and salt and are very easy to clean.\nIf you are against rubber mats or are unable to invest in them, you want to keep your car as clean as possible to protect the carpet. Many people who do not have rubber mats actually keep a second pair of shoes in the car that they can change into when entering. This is a very good strategy if you are often alone in your car, but if you happen to travel with a family in tow it can be difficult to realistically enforce this for everybody all the time.\nAnother strategy is to cover your carpets with either plastic or newspaper to protect them from debris. This can be moderately effective, but you need to switch out the newspaper or plastic pretty frequently to ensure that your carpets remain protected.\nIn the event that your carpet does become soaked through, you want to remove the carpets from the vehicle and hang them up to dry. Once they are dry, then you can vacuum out the worst of the dirt. Generally speaking, trying to clean carpets while they are still wet is not a very good idea. However, you definitely want to get them out of the vehicle, otherwise they can start to molder and smell.\nHowever, the absolute best thing that you can do for the interior of your car is to get\u202ffloor mats and liners, so start your research on these purchases today.",

        "title": "How to Improve Your Interior Car Lights",
        "content": "The Benefits of LED Lights Inside Your Vehicle\n\nGone are the days when you had to deal with stock lighting inside your vehicle. With the advent of LED interior lights, you can upgrade your vehicle\u2019s existing lights. When you do, you are likely to notice some immediate benefits. Here are the pros of LED lights:\nEfficiency: LED lights typically use less energy than their conventional counterparts. Whenever you can conserve energy inside your vehicle, you are sure to notice an improvement. That is, by swapping out traditional lights for an LED alternative, you help your vehicle conserve energy and operate more efficiently.Brightness: LED lights are often brighter than standard ones. As you know, your vehicle has many nooks, curves, and compartments in its interior. When you install LED lights, you increase the overall visibility of the space inside your vehicle. This allows you to see more parts of your car. For finding items in a dark area, upgrading to LED lights likely makes sense.Longevity: Like essentially all types of lightbulbs, the interior lights in your vehicle have a limited lifespan. While LED lights do not last forever, they have a significantly longer useful life than conventional bulbs. In fact, LED bulbs often shine brightly for 15,000 hours.Affordability: The price of LED interior lights has fallen considerably in recent years. If you want to upgrade your car\u2019s existing lights, you are likely to find that LED lights are either about the same price or even more affordable than incandescent ones.\n\nReasons to Install LED Lights\n\nPart of the experience of owning a car, truck or SUV is thinking of ways to turn your stock vehicle into the custom machine of your dreams. While you have thousands of options for upgrading your vehicle, adding LED lights is a popular way to do so. Here are some of the custom reasons to install LED lights in your vehicle\u2019s interior:\nColors: You don\u2019t have to stick to white light when you install LED lights inside your vehicle. Because LEDs come in a seemingly endless number of shades, you can choose the perfect color for accenting the interior of your car.Clarity: If you are not in love with the yellowish hue of your car\u2019s existing interior lights, upgrading to LED lights may be a wise decision. Because LED lights tend to produce bright, white light, you achieve clarity when swapping out incandescent bulbs.Innovation: The sky is the limit when it comes to LED lights inside your vehicle. That is, you do not have to confine lighting to existing spaces. Because LED lights come in a variety of styles, you can stretch light into dark spaces inside your car. You can also install LED lights outside your vehicle to give it an instantly innovative appearance.\n\nSwapping Incandescent Bulbs for LED Lights\n\nWhether you are looking for improved efficiency, better lighting, or a custom enhancement for your vehicle, installing LED lights helps you achieve your goals. If you are wondering how to change interior car lights to LED, the process is likely not as difficult as you may suspect.\nAnywhere inside your vehicle where there are incandescent bulbs is eligible for an LED upgrade. That is, you may want to tackle your vehicle\u2019s dome light, glove box light, trunk light, and other lights. You do not, however, have to replace all incandescent bulbs at once. Instead, you can choose which bulbs to swap out for LED upgrades.\nWhen you are ready to begin your interior car lights project, follow these steps:\n\n5 Steps to Spruce Up Your Interior Lights\n\n1. Locate lights\n\nDepending on your vehicle\u2019s make and model, you may have one or several incandescent lights. To change incandescent bulbs for LED ones, first decide which lights you want to address. For your first project, it may be easiest to begin with the central dome light. This light is likely easy to see and access. \n\n2. Remove bulb cover\n\nMany, although not all, interior lights have a lens or cover to protect the bulb from damage. If the light you want to upgrade to LED has a cover, you must remove it to access the bulb. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual likely tells you how to remove the lens cover. If not, there is a good chance the cover either twists off or simply pops loose. Alternatively, you may need to remove a couple screws to work the bulb cover free. Regardless, you must be careful when detaching the cover to avoid damaging it. \n\n3. Pick an LED bulb\n\nNot every LED bulb fits inside every type of socket. Therefore, you must be sure to choose a compatible bulb when ordering a replacement for your incandescent bulb. The most important part of selecting the correct bulb is the connector. Put simply, you must find a bulb that has a compatible connection.\n\n4. Connect the LED bulb\n\nOnce you have a compatible LED bulb in the correct shade, you are ready to connect it. Bulbs usually have a positive and negative side. After connecting the bulb, test it to ensure it works before reattaching the lens cover. If it does not, try turning the bulb the other direction to be sure you have installed it correctly. \n\n5. Replace the lens cover\n\nAfter you have installed the bulb and checked that it works, you are ready to replace the lens cover. Simply reverse the steps you used to remove it. Before you do, though, clean dust, dirt, and debris from the inside of the lens cover to ensure you do not obscure your new LED light.\n\nGet More From Your Interior Lights",

        "title": "How Your Car\u2019s AC Works",
        "content": "How Does a Car\u2019s Air Conditioning Work?\n\nAny AC system requires a refrigerant, such as R-134a. Your vehicle\u2019s compressor, powered by the serpentine belt, compresses the refrigerant into a liquid, putting it into a high-pressure state. This pressure forces the liquid out of the compressor through the hoses in your AC hose assembly, which carry refrigerant through the system. Regardless of which of the systems your car uses, the compressed refrigerant travels from the compressor to the condenser on the high-pressure side of the system to cool off before reaching the AC evaporator core on the low-pressure side.\nThe condenser is like a small radiator where the AC hoses come in contact with the outside air, which absorbs heat from the liquid inside before the liquid reaches the AC in-line filter, which removes debris that could contaminate the system. The now cooled refrigerant moves to the low-pressure side of the system through either the expansion valve or the orifice tube, depending on which system you have. There it goes through the evaporator core in a gaseous state, allowing the refrigerant to absorb heat from the air that passes through the evaporator fins. This leaves the cabin with cool air while the warm refrigerant makes its way back to the compressor.\nScroll down to see a step-by-step breakdown of how refrigerant travels through your car\u2019s AC parts.\n*Air conditioning systems will use either an orifice tube/accumulator or an expansion valve/receiver-drier set up. Some vehicles that have a rear AC system can use a combination of the two with an additional evaporator.\n\nAutomotive AC System Components\n\n1. The System is Filled with Refrigerant\n\nThe refrigerant gas used in most vehicles is commonly known as R134A. Prior to 1994, R12 was used in air conditioning systems, but was discontinued due to the highly polluting nature of the gas. The ability of the refrigerant to change its physical properties as it is compressed, cooled and metered is what makes the AC system work.\n\n2. The Refrigerant is Turned into Liquid by the Compressor\n\nThe compressor is responsible for compressing the refrigerant gas. When the gas is compressed it becomes very hot and is then sent through a condenser.\n\n3. Refrigerant is Cooled in the Condenser\n\nThe condenser is a series of coils that outside air passes over to remove the heat from the compressed gas. This will cause the gas to cool and condense into a cold liquid.\n\nA parallel style (non-serpentine) condenser cannot be flushed and must be replaced if it fails.\nA serpentine-style condenser can be identified by inspecting the ends of the component and observing a snake like appearance that indicates a long singular tube that switches back several times almost like a ribbon. This style condenser can be flushed using the AC Flush Kit available in the AutoZone Loan-A-Tool program.\n\n4. Air is Dried in the Receiver-Drier*\n\nThe receiver-drier is a canister that contains desiccant inside to absorb moisture. The receiver-drier sometimes has a sight-glass on top to observe flow (however, on retrofitted systems the sight glass will be rendered useless since the oil used with R134A is not transparent), while an accumulator will not.\n*In expansion valve and receiver-drier systems\n\n5. Debris is Removed by the AC Inline Filter\n\nThe AC Inline Filter Kit traps debris that even flushing cannot remove from your AC lines.\n\n6. The Liquid Refrigerant is Turned into Mist by the Expansion Valve*\n\nThe expansion valve provides a restriction in the flow of refrigerant. This restriction causes the refrigerant to change from a high-pressure liquid refrigerant into low-pressure liquid refrigerant mist before it enters the evaporator. The failure of an expansion device is usually restricted flow due to clogging.\n*In expansion valve and receiver-drier systems\n\n7. \u2026or by the Orifice Tube*\n\nThe orifice tube has a conical shaped fixed orifice that provides restriction in the flow of refrigerant. This restriction causes the refrigerant to change from high pressure liquid refrigerant into low pressure liquid refrigerant mist before it enters the evaporator. The failure of an orifice tube is usually restricted flow due to clogging.\n*In orifice tube and accumulator systems\n\n8. The Mist Removes Warm Air from the Cabin in the Evaporator\n\nAs the low-pressure liquid refrigerant mist flows through the evaporator, a blower motor pushes air across the cold tubes of the evaporator to deliver cooled air into the passenger compartment of the automobile.\n\n9. Moisture is Removed from the Mist by the Accumulator*\n\nThe accumulator is a holding tank for the refrigerant exiting the evaporator. While the refrigerant is circulating inside, the accumulator desiccant bag removes any moisture that may be present.\n*In orifice tube and accumulator systems\n\nTwo Common A/C Systems\n\nOrifice Tube and Accumulator System\n\nThis\ntype of system features an orifice tube before the evaporator core and an\naccumulator before the compressor. The orifice tube restricts the refrigerant\nflow, changing the high-pressure liquid to a low-pressure mist before entering\nthe evaporator. The accumulator is a holding tank with a desiccant bag to\nremove any moisture from the refrigerant before it reaches the compressor.\n\nExpansion Valve and Receiver-Drier System\n\nThis\nsystem has a receiver-drier between the condenser and the in-line filter kit\nand an expansion valve before the evaporator core. It contains desiccant to\nabsorb moisture like the accumulator does, but the receiver-drier is located on\nthe high-pressure side instead of the low-pressure side. The expansion valve\nplays the same role as the orifice tube in that it restricts refrigerant flow\nto allow the pressurized liquid to expand into a low-pressure mist.",

        "title": "Learn 3 Common AC Problems",
        "content": "How to Diagnose Your Car\u2019s AC Problems\n\n1. Is Your AC Cool but Not Cold?\n\nIf the air conditioning is set to max cool and fans on high, but is only blowing moderately cool air:Check to see that the cooling fans on the condenser or radiator are running when the air \u2013conditioning is on.Look for any restrictions like leaves, bugs or dirt that would keep air from passing over the condenser.Check the cabin air filter to ensure that it is not clogged.Beyond this, the next step is to always check the pressures in the system using a manifold gauge set. The recommended high-side and low-side pressures can be found in your vehicle\u2019s repair manual, or online. Once you have your gauges hooked up, move on to observing the AC compressor itself.\n\n2. Start with the AC Compressor\n\nWhen diagnosing an air conditioning issue, it\u2019s easiest to begin at the compressor:With the engine running turn the A/C on max cool, set fans high, and make sure that the clutch is engaging on the compressor. Note: this is not the pulley, but the center piece that engages the pulley to the compressor shaft. If the clutch is engaging and disengaging once every few seconds, this is a sign of low refrigerant. You will also see the low-side pressure on your gauge drop rapidly when the clutch engages, hit a point of too-low pressure, then disengage and the pressure will rise. As you add more refrigerant, the gauge will hold steady, with the compressor running, and should hold at the recommended pressure.\n\nIf the clutch is not engaging and the system has refrigerant, use a voltmeter to check for voltage getting to the compressor.\nIf there is voltage \u2013 the clutch may be bad.\nIf there is no voltage \u2013 a cycling switch may be bad, a fuse may be blown, and the system may not have enough refrigerant pressure to trip the low pressure cutoff switch that cycles the compressor.\n\n3. Most Problems are Caused by Leaks\n\nLeaks are the most common problem associated with the air conditioning system. If pressure is low, then there may be a leak:\n\nUsing a UV A/C leak detection kit is the easiest way to find a leak. Follow the instructions on the packaging to introduce UV dye to the system and UV light to find the leak.\nCheck around all fittings to verify that they are all secure.\nCheck hose manifolds on the compressor.\nCheck the front seal and the o-rings sealing the pressure switches on the back of some compressors.\nCheck where the hoses are crimped onto the fittings.\nCheck the Schrader Valves.Check for pin holes in the condenser.\n\nCheck where the evaporator drains condensation with UV light. Sometimes oil or dye can be seen.Note: The dye check will not work if the system is too low and the compressor is not cycling.\n\nStill Not Sure? Check These Components\n\nAC Compressor and Clutch\n\nThe AC compressor is a rotating pump that circulates refrigerant (Freon) throughout the system.\nCommon Problems: Leaks in one or more seals or the compressor itself can occur. Particle contamination from worn parts inside the compressor are a frequent culprit. The engagement clutch, called an AC clutch, can also fail rendering the compressor inoperative.\nWhat to Look For: If the refrigerant is low, check for visible system leaks that appear green and oily. Failing internal components caused by normal wear or low AC Oil levels caused by leaks. Failed AC clutch. Failed power supply to the AC clutch caused by a blown fuse, bad pressure control switch, dash control module or a broken circuit wire. Inspect and test before replacing!\n\nAC Accumulator / Drier\n\nThe Accumulator/Drier collects and absorbs moisture. Moisture is like poison to the internal system components and can damage the AC Compressor as well. Depending on your vehicle, you may have an accumulator or a receiver/drier.\nCommon Problems: Internal failure allowing desiccant material to enter the AC system. Like sugar in the gas tank, this stuff in the wrong places can cause major problems. Leaks can result in over-saturation of the desiccant material that can lead to compressor damage.\n\nAC Orifice Tube / Expansion Valve\n\nThe AC orifice tube / expansion device filters and regulates the flow of refrigerant through your air conditioning system. Depending on your vehicle, you may have an orifice tube or an expansion valve.\nCommon Problems: Contamination is the main cause of failure. If the system pressures are too high and/or too low, the expansion device could possibly be the issue. But first, ensure the refrigerant levels are correct and the radiator/A/C Condenser fan(s) are working properly. Remember, inspect and test before replacing!\n\nAC Condenser\n\nThe AC condenser looks similar to a radiator and works in conjunction with the radiator fan(s). Air flowing across the AC condenser tubes cool the hot (gaseous) refrigerant that absorbed heat from inside the vehicle. This returns the refrigerant back to a liquid state where it will once again enter the evaporator core and absorb more heat from the interior.\nCommon Problems: Refrigerant leaks. Contaminant particles from the AC Compressor or AC Accumulator/Drier restricting the flow of refrigerant can lead to poor cooling. While checking the AC Condenser, inspect the Radiator / AC cooling fan motor(s).\n\nAC Evaporator Core\n\nThe AC evaporator acts like a huge ice cube with holes in it. It allows the hot, cabin air to flow through the core, rapidly cools this air, and blows it out into the cabin again. The cool air felt from the dash vents is provided by the AC heater blower motor assembly.\nCommon Problems: The number one cause of failure is a leak due to age and wear. An electronic leak detector is the best way to check for leaks. Give attention to the AC evaporator box water drain tube. Use the tester to search for a leak. A green and oily substance may appear in the drain tube if larger leaks are present.",

        "content": "Tips for Cleaning Your Windshield and Glass\n\n1. Be Aware of When You Clean the Windshield\n\nThere are certain conditions you want to avoid when cleaning your windshield. Obviously you\u2019re not going to have much success if you attempt to clean the outside of the windshield while it\u2019s raining or snowing outside. However, cleaning a hot windshield is also going to create additional problems. \nDirect sunlight or a hot windshield will cause the windshield washer fluid or cleaner to evaporate when it\u2019s applied. This not only creates streaking issues and reduces the impact of the cleaner, but it can also create harmful vapors that can be damaging if inhaled. Always clean a windshield in a garage or in shade to avoid these problems.\n\n2. Choose the Right Supplies\n\nThe first item to choose is the windshield auto glass cleaner. A general rule of thumb is to avoid using products that contains ammonia, alcohol or any ingredients that produce toxic fumes. Glass cleaners come in aerosol cans and spray bottles, and several great auto glass cleaners come in a wipe.\nYou will also need is the right towels or rags to clean the windshield. Back in the \u201cold days\u201d using a newspaper was the best item for effectively cleaning a windshield, but times and technology have changed quite a bit. The best products to use now are microfiber towels.\nWhen you buy microfiber towels, make sure you have (4) to use. Two for the inside glass and two for the outside glass. The first towel will be used to remove liquid residue from the auto glass cleaner, the second is used to remove excessive \u2018fog\u2019 or residual. This step will be addressed below.\n\n3. Start on the Outside\n\nStart by cleaning the outside of the windshield. Spray or apply auto glass cleaner on a small section. If you\u2019re using a spray, follow the directions to determine how long to leave the product on the windshield. Once the product has soaked in (this doesn\u2019t take long, just a second or two), use the first microfiber towel to remove the liquid. \nWhen all liquid has been removed, used the second, clean microfiber towel to \u201cbuff\u201d the windshield. This is best done in a circular motion, to remove the haze that builds-up. Continue these steps until the entire windshield is clean.\n\n4. Continue with the Inside\n\nFor the inside of the windshield, the steps are identical. It might be more difficult to reach certain areas, so clean the inside in three-sections if needed. The Invisible Glass triangle brush is great for helping to clean hard-to-reach corners of the inside of the windshield.\n\nOrder online or visit one of our AutoZone locations to find the best auto glass cleaning supplies that will keep your windshield clean, and improve your visibility as you drive.",

        "title": "Brake Lights vs Tail Lights",
        "content": "Overview of Brake Lights and Tail Lights\n\nBrake lights and tail lights may appear similar and often use the same bulb, but they serve distinct purposes. Brake lights are designed to illuminate when you apply your vehicle\u2019s brakes, signaling to those behind you that you are slowing down or coming to a stop. Tail lights, on the other hand, are always on when your headlights or marker lights are activated, serving as a crucial component of your vehicle\u2019s rear lighting system.\n\nFunctionality: What Sets Brake Lights Apart?\n\nBrake lights go beyond just indicating that you\u2019re slowing down. They serve as an immediate warning to drivers behind you. When you press the brake pedal, an electrical circuit closes in the brake light switch and triggers the brake lights to illuminate, alerting others that you are decelerating. This swift response is crucial for preventing rear-end collisions, giving drivers behind you the time needed to react.\nImagine a scenario where you need to make a sudden stop \u2013 perhaps due to an unexpected obstacle or a rapid change in traffic conditions like a driver slamming on the brakes ahead of you. Brake lights provide an instantaneous visual cue to those behind you, giving them precious seconds to respond and avoid a potential collision. Even fractions of a second make a difference at highway speed. This rapid communication can make all the difference in preventing accidents and promoting overall road safety.\nBrake lights are always red in color, and when they\u2019re applied, they shine brightly. In almost all vehicles, there\u2019s a center high-mount stop lamp that illuminates too. If there is more than one filament in a brake light bulb, it\u2019s possible that both will be lit when the brakes are applied.\n\nTail Lights: More Than Just Rear Markers\n\nWhile brake lights grab attention during stops, tail lights serve as constant rear markers for your vehicle. They are an integral part of your vehicle\u2019s lighting system, ensuring that your car is visible to others on the road at all times. Tail lights are typically on whenever your marker lights or headlights are activated, providing a continuous indicator of your presence at times when visibility is less than perfect.\nTail lights contribute significantly to overall visibility, especially in low-light conditions. Whether you\u2019re driving at dusk, dawn, or during inclement weather, tail lights make your vehicle more noticeable to those following behind. This increased visibility reduces the risk of rear-end collisions and enhances the safety of both you and the drivers around you.\nTaillights are also red, like brake lights, but at a much lower intensity so they won\u2019t be mistaken for the brake light bulbs. They may share the same bulb as the brakes or be separate \u2013 it depends on your vehicle\u2019s design.\n\nChoosing the Right Lights for Your Vehicle\n\nWhen it comes to selecting the right brake and tail lights for your vehicle, several factors should be taken into account:\n\nConsider the compatibility with your vehicle\u2019s make and model, ensuring a proper fit.\nUse the same bulb size and color, which is indicated on the side of the bulb.\nAdditionally, check for lights that comply with safety standards to guarantee optimal performance.\n\nFor the best visibility and lighting performance, choose lights that are not only compliant with safety standards but also provide brightness and clarity. LED lights, for instance, are known to be energy efficient and easily seen. Regularly inspect and replace your brake and tail lights to ensure they are in top working condition, further keeping you safe on the road.\n\n\u202fFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "When to Replace a Brake Light Switch",
        "content": "Understanding the Brake Light Switch\u2019s Role\n\nBefore delving into when to replace a brake light switch, let\u2019s first understand its role. The brake light switch is located near the brake pedal assembly, and its primary function is to activate your vehicle\u2019s brake lights when you apply pressure to the brake pedal. This simple yet critical action serves two primary purposes.\n\nVisibility. When you press the brake pedal, the brake lights instantly illuminate at the rear of your vehicle. This alerts drivers behind you that you\u2019re slowing down or coming to a stop, helping prevent rear-end collisions, especially in low-light conditions or inclement weather.\nSafety. Your brake lights also inform drivers and pedestrians of your intentions on the road, contributing to smoother traffic flow and reducing the risk of accidents.\n\nBut it also serves as a signal for your vehicle\u2019s onboard computer. If you have your cruise control set, pressing the brake pedal sends a signal to the computer to cancel the set speed, letting your car decelerate.\nSigns of a Failing Brake Light Switch\n\nA malfunctioning brake light switch can compromise your safety and potentially lead to accidents. Fortunately, there are telltale signs that can alert you to the need for a brake light switch replacement.\n\nBrake lights stay on. If your brake lights remain illuminated even when you\u2019re not pressing the brake pedal, it\u2019s a clear sign of a failing brake light switch. This not only poses a risk to your safety but also drains your vehicle\u2019s battery.\nBrake lights don\u2019t illuminate. On the flip side, if your brake lights don\u2019t come on when you press the brake pedal, it\u2019s another indicator of a malfunctioning switch. This can lead to rear-end collisions since drivers won\u2019t be aware you\u2019re stopping.\nInconsistent brake light operation. Sometimes, a faulty switch may cause your brake lights to work intermittently. This inconsistency can confuse drivers behind you and make your intentions unclear.\nCruise control issues. If your cruise control behaves erratically or fails to disengage, it could be linked to a failing switch.\n\nNow that you know what to look for, let\u2019s move on to diagnosing a faulty brake light switch.\nDiagnosing a Faulty Brake Light Switch\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed any of the signs mentioned above, it\u2019s essential to confirm whether your brake light switch is indeed the culprit.\u00a0\nBegin with a visual inspection. Start by locating the brake light switch, typically positioned near the brake pedal assembly. Inspect the switch for visible damage or loose connections. Tighten any loose connections and replace the switch if it appears damaged. \nUsing a multimeter set to continuity mode, disconnect the electrical connector from the brake light switch. Then, press the brake pedal while testing the switch\u2019s terminals for continuity. If there\u2019s no continuity when the brake pedal is depressed, it\u2019s a clear indication that the switch is faulty and needs replacing.\nPotential Consequences of Ignoring the Brake Light Switch Issue\nNeglecting a failing brake light switch can have severe consequences beyond the inconvenience of a non-functional brake light system. Your brake lights are a critical safety feature that alerts others to your braking actions. Ignoring a malfunctioning switch increases the risk of rear-end collisions and other accidents.\nAlso, operating a vehicle with malfunctioning brake lights is often against the law and can result in traffic citations or fines. Additionally, insurance claims may be affected if an accident occurs due to this negligence.\nIf your brake lights stay on continuously due to a faulty switch, it can drain your vehicle\u2019s battery, leaving you stranded and requiring a jump-start.\nSteps for Troubleshooting and Resolving Brake Light Switch Problems\nIf you\u2019ve determined that your brake light switch is faulty, don\u2019t put it off. Follow these steps to troubleshoot and replace the brake light switch.\n\nGather tools and materials. You\u2019ll need a replacement brake light switch, a wrench or socket set, a multimeter, and a screwdriver.\nMake it safe. Ensure your vehicle is parked on a level surface with the engine turned off. Disconnect the negative terminal of the battery to prevent electrical accidents.\nLocate and remove the old switch. Find the brake light switch near the brake pedal assembly. Use your wrench or socket set to remove the mounting bolts or clips holding the switch in place. Disconnect the electrical connector.\nInstall the new switch. Connect the electrical connector to the new brake light switch and secure it in place using the mounting bolts or clips.\nTest the new switch. Reconnect the negative battery terminal and test the new switch by pressing the brake pedal to ensure the brake lights illuminate correctly.\nAdjust if necessary. If your vehicle allows for adjustment, ensure the switch is correctly positioned to activate the brake lights when the pedal is pressed.\nReassemble and test. Reassemble any components you removed during the process and test your brake lights again to confirm they are functioning correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can replace a faulty brake light switch and restore your vehicle\u2019s brake light system.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

Pull out Bulb\n\nMake sure you have gloves on when you remove the bulbs, as your skin\u2019s salts and oils can decrease their effectiveness. Both substances can cause the heat in the bulb to concentrate and potentially burn out sooner or break. After putting on your gloves, turn the bulb socket toward the left, and it should easily come out. Then, pull the bulb out of the socket slowly.\n\n4. Replace Bulb\n\nYou may want to use bulb grease to help you correctly install the brake light replacement bulb into the socket. Once you apply the bulb grease (if needed), slowly guide the new bulb into the socket. Then take the socket and carefully insert it into the same area it came from in the assembly or car. Slowly turn it to the right to secure it.\nIf you had to take out the assembly, grab those bolts and fasteners and reattach it to the car. Correctly line it up with its original spacing, so it fits and operates properly.\u00a0\n\n5. Reconnect Battery\n\nLastly, make sure to reconnect your battery carefully.\u00a0\n\nImportant Brake Light Replacement Tips to Remember\n\nEnsure the tail lights work \u2013 Before you put everything away, turn on your lights to ensure that the tail light you\u2019ve replaced is working properly. If not, you may need to disconnect the battery and recheck the assembly or the car to confirm the bulb\u2019s fit.\nSelect the right bulbs \u2013 All brake light replacement bulbs were not created equally. So, check the base of the old bulb for fitting details. Next, shop brake light replacement bulbs at AutoZone to find the correct bulb for your car. We offer a wide range of tail light bulbs, so start there to find the right one for your vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\nNewer vehicles could take a bit longer \u2013 Tail light replacement on more recent cars may be a bit more complex, but not impossible! There could be more wires to disconnect, so make sure you have those tools handy.\nRoutinely check your tail lights \u2013 Once you finish with brake light replacement, plan to check your tail lights regularly. Because of their positioning, it\u2019s hard to know if your tail lights are working properly. Therefore, set a date on your calendar every month to check to ensure your tail lights \u2014 and even headlights \u2014 are operational. Broken tail lights are not only a traffic violation, but they can contribute to a rear-end accident. So, make checking your tail lights a standard and routine inspection.",

        "title": "LED vs Halogen Headlight Bulbs: Which is Best?",
        "content": "What are the Different Types of Headlight Bulbs?\n\nThe two most common types of headlights bulbs today are halogen headlights and LED, or light emitting diode, headlights. Halogen lights got their start in Europe in the 1960s, making their debut in the United States in the late 1970s, and they represent the most common form of headlight bulb in use today. LED headlights have become more common in the last several years, as automakers are realizing the cosmetic and energy saving potential in the technology.\u00a0A third variety of headlights, HID, or High-Intensity Discharge, have been popular on high-end vehicles since the early 2000\u2019s, but are not as prevalent in the aftermarket today other than factory replacements. For the sake of choosing between LED or Halogen, we\u2019ll skip HID systems as most vehicles equipped with these systems must retain the factory bulb, which is accompanied with a ballast as well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow Halogen Headlight Bulbs Work\u00a0\n\nHalogen bulbs are like the incandescent light bulbs we grew up with in our homes, in that they pass electrical current through a filament within a closed bulb and that generates light. Halogen bulbs use a quartz bulb material, as opposed to the standard light bulbs that are made with a glass exterior, because a halogen bulb creates much more heat when in operation. Halogen bulbs are also brighter than standard light bulbs because their tungsten filaments release vapor that combines with the gases inside the bulb to create a cycle in which the tungsten atoms then recombine with the filament, creating higher light output and generating heat.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe other advantage to this recombination cycle is that halogen bulb filaments last longer than the filaments in traditional bulbs. The downside is that they produce a lot of heat, and all that heat manifests itself in wasted energy, when compared to some other forms of automotive lighting.\u00a0\n\nHow LED Headlight Bulbs Operate\u00a0\n\nLED lights use diodes to pass electrical current through a semiconductor in one direction, causing that material to emit photons, or light. The components in LED lighting systems are quite simple and that translates to much longer service lives than halogen bulbs. Some original equipment LED headlight bulbs can last for the service life of the vehicle, while halogen bulbs are known to burn out after 500 to 1,000 hours of use. LED bulbs also use dramatically less electricity to provide similar or better lighting output, and that is a game changer in the automotive industry, especially for electric vehicles. Another bonus is little heat is produced.\u00a0\n\nWhere do LED Headlights Excel?\u00a0\n\nThere are several advantages to LED headlights in automobiles, including improved light output and frequency, flexibility in creating stylistic lighting array shapes, light shaping, and reduced power consumption. These advantages balance the increased cost that you\u2019ll see if you are looking to upgrade.\u00a0\n\nLight Output\u00a0\n\nLED lights often have a whiter light frequency than their halogen counterparts, which makes it easier to pick up road markers and hazards in the dark. The white frequency of the light is much more comparable to daylight, when compared to the yellowish light frequency of halogen bulbs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStylistic Flexibility\u00a0\n\nManufacturers are spending millions of dollars to improve fuel efficiency in their fleets and improving the drag coefficient of a vehicle is an easy way to reduce the amount of fuel it consumes, especially at high speeds. LED lights are much smaller that halogen bulbs and can be arrayed in a range of shapes to reduce drag coefficient, improve function, and contribute to the style or design of the car. This is one of the reasons that LED lighting was first seen on luxury brands like Audi and Porshe\n\nLight Shaping\u00a0\n\nAn LED array has many small bulbs, and those bulbs can be oriented in a variety of directions to shape the light pattern. This allows manufacturers to create different light patterns for the driver side, where the light should go straight forward to avoid blinding oncoming drivers, versus the passenger side, where the light needs to illuminate objects or hazards on the shoulder of the road. It has also led to movable light arrays that follow the steering input from the driver to illuminate \u201caround the corner\u201d.\u00a0\n\nPower Consumption\u00a0\n\nEvery watt of energy consumed by a light or accessory in a running car creates drag on the alternator and that translates to poorer fuel economy. LED lights are about 80% efficient, converting much more of their energy into light, as opposed to heat. Because of that, an LED bulb requires much less energy to provide excellent illumination, and this improves the overall fuel efficiency of the vehicle.\u00a0\nIt is not a coincidence that most electric vehicles also utilize LED lighting, due to the huge energy saving inherent in their operation.\u00a0\n\nDoes the Type of Bulb Really Make a Difference?\u00a0\n\nLED headlights are superior to halogen bulbs in almost every way, but the main downside with LED headlights remains the cost. Many automakers now offer LED headlight options as an upgrade to the standard halogen or incandescent bulbs, but it is safe to say that as fuel economy standards continue to rise and electric vehicles become more common, more carmakers will adopt LED lighting as a standard feature, even replacing high-end HID systems with LED.\nIf you do some driving on highways, you might consider replacing your halogen bulbs with LED aftermarket headlights either when the original equipment headlights burn out, or just as an upgrade. The improvement in visibility will be quite dramatic and could be a literal life saver, so you can\u2019t really put a price on that. The new LED bulbs could also last for the entire life of the vehicle, so that would offset the increased purchased price as well.",

        "title": "Headlights Not Working? Check These Solutions",
        "content": "How Do Headlights Work?\nThe good news is that headlight systems are simple when compared to other systems in your car. Most headlight systems are going to involve a fuse, switch, relay, and bulb. Depending on the age of your car you may also have adaptive headlights or running lights; however, even these more complex headlights systems work similarly.\nWhen the headlights turn on, they activate a relay in the system. This relay is the connection between the battery of your car and your headlights. There are also fuses involved to protect the rest of your electrical system should there be a shortage. There are special relays involved if you choose to turn on your high beam lights. When one of these components (or many of them) stop functioning properly, you may find that your headlights no longer turn on.\nCan I replace my headlights on my own?\nIn some cases, you may be able to fix your own headlights if they stop functioning. Particularly if the issue happens to be a burned-out headlight, you may be able to replace the bulb on your own with basic tools.\nIf the problem is more complex than this, you may be better off taking it to a mechanic as a mechanic has advanced electrical equipment. For instance, you may not have a voltmeter laying around at home, but your mechanic certainly does.\n\nWHY ARE MY HEADLIGHTS NOT WORKING?\n\n1. WHAT IF ONE HEADLIGHT ISN\u2019T WORKING?\n\nThis is probably the most common issue with headlights: you come home and notice that one of your headlights isn\u2019t working. The most common issue here is that one of the two bulbs has simply burned out. Even if both of your headlights were installed at the same time, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they will have the exact same life. In fact, it\u2019s more common for one bulb to fail before the other as opposed to both failing at the same time.\n\nVisual inspection may prove that one of your headlights has corrosion or damage at the site of the\u00a0headlight connector. In the event that the electrical connector is simply not tight enough, you may find that pushing on it solves the problem.\n\nHowever, you may want to take the time to ensure that outside forces are not at work. Generally speaking, a halogen capsule headlight lasts between 500 and 1,000 hours of driving in the dark. If your light has suspiciously failed before this amount of time, there may be something at work outside of the electrical system that is causing it to fail. Another red flag is\u00a0condensation on the inside surface of the headlight. Sometimes the seal around the headlight can fail, and this leads to water leaking inside of the headlight. If this happens, then the headlight experiences a drastically reduced lifespan. In this case, fixing the entire headlight assembly is necessary to prevent leakage.\n\n2. WHAT IF BOTH HEADLIGHTS STOP WORKING?\n\nBoth headlights suddenly ceasing to work is generally rarer than one headlight turning off. A\u00a0voltmeter\u00a0can help you check the level of power at the headlights. However, the issue causing the failure is usually going to be more complex than bad bulbs if both lights go out simultaneously. In this case, you may need to go through and test out the headlight fuses, switches, and relays.\n\nThe easiest of these components to check is the fuse. You need to read your owner\u2019s manual to discover how your particular car operates, but replacing a blown fuse is relatively simple in most circumstances. It is very important to ensure that you are replacing the old fuse with a new fuse featuring the same amperage rating. If you replace the fuse and it blows again soon after, you likely have an issue somewhere else in the circuit.\n\nIf both of your headlights are not working and the fuse is not blown, you should experiment with the relay. The most basic way to do this is to shake it: if you hear rattling inside of the relay, this likely means that the relay has experienced failure. Discolored terminals on the relay can also be a red flag. If your headlights are not working but high beams are, it\u2019s likely that the relay is the culprit.\n\nIn some cars, identical relays are used in circuits outside of the headlight system. In this event, you can exchange the\u00a0headlight relay\u00a0with an identical component to test it out. If this results in your headlights functioning again, then the problem is the relay and you can simply purchase a new one for installation.\n\nIf this does not fix the problem or if you find that your car has a different relay for the headlight system compared to other electrical components, you may need to take it into a professional for a diagnosis. More advanced equipment may be necessary to determine the problem.\n\n3. WHAT IF MY HEADLIGHTS ARE JUST DIM?\n\nIf your headlights are still functioning but simply not as bright as they used to be, there may be a number of factors causing this. The first is that as headlights age, they often lose a bit of their brightness. You may find that simply replacing the bulbs fixes the problem.\n\nAnother issue could be related to the headlight lenses. Oftentimes, older\u00a0headlight lenses\u00a0may discolor or oxidize after a period of time. Additionally, the headlight lenses may simply be dirty, in which case it is time to\u00a0clean the assembly. If your headlights are foggy, this may be caused by condensation on the inside of the lenses. Generally foggy headlights mean that you should fix or replace the headlight assembly.\n\nFixing headlights when they go out or go dim is of utmost importance. Safe driving depends on it, so fix any issues related to your headlight system today.",

        "title": "How to Remove Moisture from Headlights",
        "content": "How Moisture\u00a0Affects Your Headlights\n\nRemoving a Headlight Bulb\nTrapped moisture can be dangerous, particularly for nighttime driving. Just like debris and fog on the exterior of your headlight casing, moisture trapped inside the seal can dim your lights or even create blind spots.\nIn some states, you won\u2019t pass your vehicle inspection with headlight fog. This could be caused by a leak in the seal around your headlight, which allows water to enter the space behind your headlight lens. Alternatively, it may be caused by moist air, which heats up when your\u00a0headlight bulb\u00a0is turned on and cools off when it is shut off. This causes condensation to form on the inside of the lens.\nHere are some steps you can take to remove moisture from your headlights:\n\n1. Remove Minor Condensation\n\nIf you notice a small area of condensation building up in your headlight, there\u2019s a few easy tricks you can use without breaking the\u00a0headlight seal. Breaking the seal between your headlight lens and housing is relatively easy, but once it\u2019s broken, you\u2019ll need to be very cautious to create a firm seal once you replace it. If you aren\u2019t comfortable working with sealants, it might be worth bringing your car to a mechanic who is.\n\nBefore removing the seal, check your headlight housing vent. The exact location of the venting will depend on your make and model of vehicle, but most headlight units have a vent to help prevent condensation buildup. A common cause of minor condensation is a blocked vent. This could be caused by debris, spider webs or dust. Carefully wipe the vent or blow it out with compressed air. Try not to blow or push any debris into the headlight housing, otherwise you\u2019ll need to break the seal to remove it.\n\n2. Remove Major Condensation\n\nMajor condensation requires more extensive tricks. There are a number you can try, depending on your resources, available time and the amount of condensation. For major condensation removal, you\u2019ll need to remove the headlight unit. Refer to a service manual for instructions on removing the bulb, electronics, plugs, and any other components you can. Carefully remove the headlight housing and follow the removal strategy.\n\nUse a hairdryer to dry out the moist air without breaking the seal. Use a hairdryer to blow hot, dry air into the vent or on the outside of the headlight unit. As it heats up, it should dry out. Wait for your headlight unit to cool off to determine whether this strategy was effective.\n\nFinally, if you want to know how to get water out of headlights thoroughly, you\u2019ll need to remove the seal. Before attempting this, check a service manual to figure out how to remove your seal. This route will be substantially more complicated and require a\u00a0heat gun\u00a0unless your assembly uses a replaceable seal. If you don\u2019t have experience using a heat gun in these kinds of situations, your headlight assembly is probably not the thing to try it out on. These instructions assume you have a replaceable seal.\n\nFor this removal strategy, you\u2019ll need\u00a0hand tools\u00a0like sockets and screwdrivers, silica gel packs, a lint-free cloth, and a\u00a0sealant. It\u2019s more time consuming than other options but should thoroughly remove any moisture buildup.\n\nCarefully remove the seal and the clear plastic headlight cover from the housing. Make sure you don\u2019t miss a screw or other attachment point. Wipe off the existing moisture with your cloth. Be sure the cloth is clean and dry before use. Drying off the interior with a cloth will remove most of the moisture, but it isn\u2019t a perfect solution.\n\nIn order to soak up the remaining moisture, use silica gel packs. These can be placed in the headlight assembly and are designed to soak up any moisture in the air. You don\u2019t want a pack bouncing around in front of your headlight beam, so be sure they aren\u2019t blocking the light or exposed to the bulbs.\n\nCheck again to see if there\u2019s any existing moisture or debris in your headlight assembly. Use the following steps to prevent further moisture and effectively reseal your assembly. This is the most important step, as improper reinstallation will allow more moisture to enter your headlight.\n\n3. Prevent Further Moisture\n\nThe key to preventing further moisture is creating a strong seal. There\u2019s a number of products that can help you recreate a firm seal. First, inspect the seal for any damage or debris. If necessary, run a bead of silicone sealant around the factory seal area to ensure no moisture can enter the assembly, or replace the seal if your housing uses a replaceable seal. You\u2019ll also want to check the O-rings that protect the electrical connectors, bulb, vent and other components of your headlight assembly.\n\nConsider purchasing a few quality products to promote a strong seal. Silicone spray is excellent for protecting your O-rings, and silicone sealant gel can be used to repair any cracks or damaged portion of seal between the lens and housing.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve carefully inspected and sealed your headlight, it\u2019s time to reinstall it. Check that you have the correct angle and that all brackets and electrical connectors are firmly in place. Test out your light to be sure it\u2019s working properly and shining brightly. Routinely inspect your headlight for any signs that it may not have sealed properly.\n\nFind All the\u00a0Parts You Need\n\nRestoring your headlight may be a time-consuming project, but with just a few tools and these steps you can avoid a costly headlight assembly replacement. If you need to remove moisture from one headlight, keep an eye on the other one as well. Chances are, the same issue may appear on your other headlight.",

        "title": "Everything You Should Know About Light Bars",
        "content": "What is a Light Bar\n\nEssentially, a light bar mounts onto the roof (sometimes elsewhere, but normally the roof) of a truck or SUV in order to help provide additional lighting. Given that many people who own modified trucks like to go off-roading or otherwise drive in dark, unlit spaces, having a light bar can make these endeavors much more fun and far less dangerous.\nWay back in the day, people who wanted to drive their trucks in unlit spaces would just stack headlights on top of headlights until they got the output they wanted, but then the aftermarket caught up to desire and started offering other options.\nThe original solution was KC HiLites, which you may recognize from the famous vehicle in Back to the Future. However, while these were cool looking and definitely provided a lot of light output, they required replacing bulbs far too often and the amount of power they needed to operate could result in a difficult installation.\nThus, attention turned to LED light bars. LED light bars can provide an outstanding amount of light with a comparatively small amount of required power. They also operate at far lower temperatures than halogen and are extremely reliable. The issue originally with LED was the expense, but this has definitely dropped in recent years. If you don\u2019t believe us, go ahead and check out the lightbulb selection at your local big-box store. You\u2019ll definitely see a lot of affordable options.\nEssentially, light bars have solved one of the major problems facing off-road enthusiasts for years: how to get a lot of light for a little money, little hassle, little power, and not needing to install a heavy-duty headache rack in order to attach halogen lights. This is why you see light bars basically anywhere you go. They are practical, affordable, and make off-roading fun.\n\nWhat to Consider When Buying a Light Bar\n\nNow that we have convinced you that light bars are the best thing since sliced bread, you\u2019re probably tempted to go out and purchase one right away. However, it\u2019s important to keep some things in mind to ensure that you end up with the right light bar for you.\nIf you are looking to outfit a vehicle for recreational activities like camping, off-roading, hunting, or anything like that, you want to turn an eye to the amount of lumens that different light bars produce. The more lumens that are available, the more light that a light bar produces. Therefore, you should focus on getting the light bar with the highest lumen output that you can afford.\nIf you are the sort who needs a light bar on a work vehicle, your concerns are slightly different. You definitely want to make sure that you have a waterproof housing on your light bar for when you have to work in inclement weather.\nFor those of you (we know who you are) who simply just want to trick out your truck and make it look great, your main concern is likely style. Take a look at the different finishes available in the market and see what your preferred aesthetic is. You also want to consider where you want to mount the light bar. You could choose a mount on the top of the cab, the front bumper, the grill, or the brush guard. You also want to check out how exactly the light bar mounts, so that you have the best chance of hiding the wiring.\nTo these ends, there are many different options in the light bar market. Pay attention to the size of the light bar. Those that are around four feet long can generally be mounted in a variety of different positions, but if it\u2019s five foot and up you\u2019re usually stuck just putting it on top of the cab. Make sure that you get a bar that fits your truck well.\nPay attention to what the light bar comes with, as well. Some of them are entire install kits, and some of them are simply the light bar itself. If you want to install a lone light bar, you need to invest in mounting brackets, relay, switch, wiring, and nuts.\nLight bars can also come in a smorgasbord of colors. The color output can certainly be used to up the cool factor if you are building a show truck, but they can also be used in work applications as well. For instance, different colors can indicate whether a truck is empty or full.\nTechnology is also something to turn an eye toward. Most light bars operate with a manual switch, but some of them also offer Bluetooth technology as well. This allows you to turn the light bar on and off when you are outside of your vehicle by means of an app.\nThe good news is that installing a light bar is not very difficult at all (this is part of the reason they are so popular). You only require basic tools, such as an allen wrench set, a socket and ratchet set, and an extension.\nThen, simply follow these steps:\nHow to Install Light Bars\n\n1. Safety First\n\nMake sure to disconnect your battery before working on your vehicle\u2019s electrical systems.\n\n2. Install the Wiring Harness\n\nPut the wiring harness in the engine bay and approximate where you want the wiring to point.\n\n3. Decide Where You Want the Light Bar\n\nUse double-sided tape to mount the light bar to ensure you like the way that it looks. You also want to check to make sure that it is centered before drilling anything.\n\n4. Drill Your Holes\n\nAfter drilling, all you need to do is put the bolts in and make sure that everything is properly connected. Take the negative and positive wires and connect them to the light bar, then pass it through the firewall and connect to the on/off switch.\n\n5. Wire Up the Light Bar\n\nTake the positive wire and connect to the battery. Meanwhile, find a ground for the negative wire.\n\n6. Check Your Work\n\nReconnect your battery, then go ahead and test out the light bar.\nAfter this, you\u2019re ready to flip a switch and shine on.",

        "title": "How to Replace Tail Lights",
        "content": "Don\u2019t Put It Off\n\nResponsibly owning and driving a vehicle requires maintenance and attention to detail. It is easy to forget about issues or put them off until a later date. You shouldn\u2019t drive around too long without a tail light. Not only does this pose a danger for others on the road, but it\u2019s also illegal. You could get cited for this infraction, even on a first instance. Other drivers may rear-end you if they can\u2019t see your car\u2019s tail lights. They may lose control trying to avoid your car once they notice you\u2019re there. Take care of this issue as soon as you can.\n\nThe Issues\n\nAs you look around, you\u2019ll notice that this isn\u2019t an uncommon problem. Taillights fail frequently for many reasons. The bulb itself may have burned out, as these don\u2019t last forever. There could faulty wiring or a disconnected wire somewhere. Accidents could cause the light to crack or break as well. You may have to replace the light and the light cover in some cases.\n\nWhy Do It Yourself?\n\nEven if you are not the handiest person in the world, this is a task you should be able to handle. You don\u2019t have to be a mechanic or even have experience replacing vehicle bulbs. This is an ideal project for a first-timer. It\u2019ll take you more time to finish this than it would for a professional or someone with more experience. However, you\u2019ll be able to save and learn an important skill.\n\nBe Prepared\n\nIt\u2019s important to know what to expect with any car maintenance or repair job. Fortunately, tail light bulb replacement isn\u2019t difficult and shouldn\u2019t take you more than 45 minutes to an hour to complete. Be aware that newer models may be a little more complicated than older ones, as there will be more wires to disconnect. Make sure you grab a screwdriver, socket wrench and a pair of gloves before starting the replacement process.\n\nHow to Change Tail Light Bulbs\n\n1. Safety First\n\nSafety is critical anytime you are working with bulbs and wires. Start by disconnecting the car battery. This will reduce the risk of shock or electrocution. Once you have done this, you\u2019ll need to access the tail lights through the trunk or rear hatch. It will be helpful to do this in a well-lit place, or you can grab a flashlight. There could be extra carpet or padding in the way of the access point. Move these away until you can easily see the back of the taillights. Some cars have a panel you\u2019ll have to remove, so have your screwdriver handy.\n\n2. Remove the Bulb Holders\n\nOnce you can see and touch the taillights, remove the bulb holders from the rear side of the lamp. You can do this by moving them clockwise. Remove the broken or burned-out bulbs; be careful to not cut yourself if the bulbs are broken. Put on a pair of gloves and replace the bulbs with the new ones. The gloves will help keep the bulbs clean, thus preserving their life and effectiveness.\n\n3. Remove the Assembly\n\nYour job isn\u2019t quite done yet. Next,  you need to remove the tail light assembly. Once you  find and take out the nuts, this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. It may require you to use some grease or oil to help free the nuts. The assembly should easily slide out at this point.\n\n4. Final Processes\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to put the assembly back in the housing, first hand-tighten the bolts before using a ratchet. It\u2019s important to not tighten these too much, as they have a tendency to crack or break the housing. Replace the bulb holders. These should look different than the turn signal lights and brake lights. Finish up by replacing the carpet and any panels in the trunk. Don\u2019t forget to reconnect the car battery.\n\nTest Them Out\n\nYou may feel good about learning how to change tail light bulb, but your job isn\u2019t quite done yet. Before you put all your tools away and drive off, make sure you did everything correctly. Turn on the lights and see if the taillights are working properly. This is also a good time to check the turn signal lights and brake lights. If they are not, you may have skipped a step. Retrace your steps and try again.\n\nChoosing the Right Bulbs\n\nThough your car will run just fine without tail lights, this will create an unsafe environment for you and for cars on the road around you. These lights are priced within anyone\u2019s budget and are simple to install. Following these guidelines, and you should be able to put in your new lights correctly and quickly.",

        "title": "How to Improve Your Interior Car Lights",
        "content": "The Benefits of LED Lights Inside Your Vehicle\n\nGone are the days when you had to deal with stock lighting inside your vehicle. With the advent of LED interior lights, you can upgrade your vehicle\u2019s existing lights. When you do, you are likely to notice some immediate benefits. Here are the pros of LED lights:\nEfficiency: LED lights typically use less energy than their conventional counterparts. Whenever you can conserve energy inside your vehicle, you are sure to notice an improvement. That is, by swapping out traditional lights for an LED alternative, you help your vehicle conserve energy and operate more efficiently.Brightness: LED lights are often brighter than standard ones. As you know, your vehicle has many nooks, curves, and compartments in its interior. When you install LED lights, you increase the overall visibility of the space inside your vehicle. This allows you to see more parts of your car. For finding items in a dark area, upgrading to LED lights likely makes sense.Longevity: Like essentially all types of lightbulbs, the interior lights in your vehicle have a limited lifespan. While LED lights do not last forever, they have a significantly longer useful life than conventional bulbs. In fact, LED bulbs often shine brightly for 15,000 hours.Affordability: The price of LED interior lights has fallen considerably in recent years. If you want to upgrade your car\u2019s existing lights, you are likely to find that LED lights are either about the same price or even more affordable than incandescent ones.\n\nReasons to Install LED Lights\n\nPart of the experience of owning a car, truck or SUV is thinking of ways to turn your stock vehicle into the custom machine of your dreams. While you have thousands of options for upgrading your vehicle, adding LED lights is a popular way to do so. Here are some of the custom reasons to install LED lights in your vehicle\u2019s interior:\nColors: You don\u2019t have to stick to white light when you install LED lights inside your vehicle. Because LEDs come in a seemingly endless number of shades, you can choose the perfect color for accenting the interior of your car.Clarity: If you are not in love with the yellowish hue of your car\u2019s existing interior lights, upgrading to LED lights may be a wise decision. Because LED lights tend to produce bright, white light, you achieve clarity when swapping out incandescent bulbs.Innovation: The sky is the limit when it comes to LED lights inside your vehicle. That is, you do not have to confine lighting to existing spaces. Because LED lights come in a variety of styles, you can stretch light into dark spaces inside your car. You can also install LED lights outside your vehicle to give it an instantly innovative appearance.\n\nSwapping Incandescent Bulbs for LED Lights\n\nWhether you are looking for improved efficiency, better lighting, or a custom enhancement for your vehicle, installing LED lights helps you achieve your goals. If you are wondering how to change interior car lights to LED, the process is likely not as difficult as you may suspect.\nAnywhere inside your vehicle where there are incandescent bulbs is eligible for an LED upgrade. That is, you may want to tackle your vehicle\u2019s dome light, glove box light, trunk light, and other lights. You do not, however, have to replace all incandescent bulbs at once. Instead, you can choose which bulbs to swap out for LED upgrades.\nWhen you are ready to begin your interior car lights project, follow these steps:\n\n5 Steps to Spruce Up Your Interior Lights\n\n1. Locate lights\n\nDepending on your vehicle\u2019s make and model, you may have one or several incandescent lights. To change incandescent bulbs for LED ones, first decide which lights you want to address. For your first project, it may be easiest to begin with the central dome light. This light is likely easy to see and access. \n\n2. Remove bulb cover\n\nMany, although not all, interior lights have a lens or cover to protect the bulb from damage. If the light you want to upgrade to LED has a cover, you must remove it to access the bulb. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual likely tells you how to remove the lens cover. If not, there is a good chance the cover either twists off or simply pops loose. Alternatively, you may need to remove a couple screws to work the bulb cover free. Regardless, you must be careful when detaching the cover to avoid damaging it. \n\n3. Pick an LED bulb\n\nNot every LED bulb fits inside every type of socket. Therefore, you must be sure to choose a compatible bulb when ordering a replacement for your incandescent bulb. The most important part of selecting the correct bulb is the connector. Put simply, you must find a bulb that has a compatible connection.\n\n4. Connect the LED bulb\n\nOnce you have a compatible LED bulb in the correct shade, you are ready to connect it. Bulbs usually have a positive and negative side. After connecting the bulb, test it to ensure it works before reattaching the lens cover. If it does not, try turning the bulb the other direction to be sure you have installed it correctly. \n\n5. Replace the lens cover\n\nAfter you have installed the bulb and checked that it works, you are ready to replace the lens cover. Simply reverse the steps you used to remove it. Before you do, though, clean dust, dirt, and debris from the inside of the lens cover to ensure you do not obscure your new LED light.\n\nGet More From Your Interior Lights",

        "title": "How to Change Headlights",
        "content": "What to consider when you\u2019re selecting for bulbs your vehicle\n\nThrow distance or how far you can see down the road. One of the most important aspects for seeing better at night is looking ahead, being able to see twists and turns or obstacles in the road. Seeing farther gives you the chance to react more quickly in the dark.\nColor temperature. Some bulbs feature a warmer white, while some feature a cooler white. A cooler white will give you greater contrast and clarity \u2013 especially on reflective surfaces like road markings or road lines.\nBulb life, or how long a bulb lasts.\n\nBenefits of different bulbs\n\nSylvania Basics are the longest lasting bulbs on the shelf and they\u2019ll closely match what came in your vehicle from the factory.\nXtraVision bulbs are rated for more down road vision and longer throw distance.\nSilverstar bulbs pair more down road vision with a cooler whiter light color.\nSilverstar Ultra gives the same Silverstar white light with the farthest down road field of vision of any Sylvania bulb.\nZXE are incredibly powerful halogen bulbs that give the look and feel of an HID or LED system with no conversion kit and no worries about the bulbs being street legal.\n\nHow to install headlight bulbs\n\n1. Safety first\n\nYou want to protect your hands and face with safety gloves and goggles during this installation. You\u2019ll be holding sensitive bulbs and potentially reaching into some tight spots, so make sure you\u2019re protected.\n\n2. Replace both bulbs (recommended)\n\nIf you\u2019re replacing one bulb, it\u2019s a good idea to replace them both. It\u2019ll save you time later and ensure you\u2019re looking at even lighting on the road.\n\n3. Identify the high and low beam placement\n\nMost vehicles have a separate bulb for the high beam and the low beam, but some vehicles use one bulb for both. If your vehicle has two bulbs, the low beam bulb is usually on the outside, and the high beam is usually on the inside. Test this or check a repair guide to be sure on your vehicle. \n\n4. Gain access to the lights (this varies)\n\nThis is where you\u2019ll run into the most variance. Some headlights are stored in removable, easy-to-access assemblies that usually come out after removing a few screws.Take those out, and you can lay the headlight assembly onto the fascia to reach the bulbs. Example of this at 2:06 in the video on the top of the page.\nOther bulbs can only be accessed by going through the wheel well. You may need some tools to pull the wheel arch back to get to the bulb, remove and replace it, and then reinstall the wheel well cover. Example of this at 3:40 in the video\nSome casings don\u2019t remove easily, but, with the hood up, you can reach behind the casing and access the bulb. It\u2019s not always so easy, though. Occasionally you will have to remove something, in the video it\u2019s an air filter housing but in other vehicles it may be a coolant reservoir or a battery, to get to one or more of the bulbs. If that\u2019s the case, just remove what you need to, change the bulb, and put back what you removed. Example of this install at 6:21 in the video.\n\n5. Remove the plug by releasing the clip\n\nWhen you\u2019re removing the plug for the bulb, a pocket screw driver helps to release the clip. These can be stiff sometimes, especially if it\u2019s an older vehicle.\n\n6. Remove the old bulb\n\nSimply grab the bulb casing and turn it counter-clockwise. When the tabs line up, you can pull it straight out.\n\n7. Identify the correct high and low beam bulbs\n\n8. Install the new bulb\n\nTo install the bulb, line up the tabs turn clockwise about a quarter turn until you hear a click. Install these one at a time so you don\u2019t get confused as to whether you\u2019re replacing a high or low beam.\n\n9. Install on both sides\n\nEven if one of the lights is still working. It\u2019s always a good idea to replace bulbs in pairs for maximum safety and visibility.\n\n10. Test the headlights\n\nWith your bulbs installed, turn the headlights on and cycle through the high and low beams to make sure everything is working properly.\n\nThe bulbs you find at AutoZone fit more than 90% of the vehicles on the road, giving you great options for safety and style. Using one of the techniques above, installing new bulbs you can do this yourself. Just remember to replace both bulbs so you have even lighting on the road.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "How to Adjust Your Headlights",
        "content": "How to Adjust Your Car\u2019s Headlights\n\n1. Level the Vehicle\n\nBefore adjusting your headlights, make sure the car is level. This means checking the tire pressure and removing any excess weight from the cargo area or trunk. It\u2019s also a good idea to adjust the headlights when your gas tank is half-full. If possible, have someone sit in the driver\u2019s seat to mimic the weight that would be present when you\u2019re on the road driving at night. Position the car on level ground by parking 10 to 15 feet from a dark garage door or wall with the headlights aimed toward the wall. Bounce the car on all four corners a few times to level out the shocks, then measure the distance from the ground to each headlight to make sure they\u2019re level.\n\n2. Measure the Lights\n\nNow that the car is level, turn on the headlights. Just use the low beams, not the high beams or fog lights, as those can give you an inaccurate reading. Mark the headlight beams vertically and horizontally on the wall with masking tape. This should create a cross. Using the taped marks, measure the lines (cross) to check that they\u2019re even. If they\u2019re uneven, note the difference in measurements and lower the highest center line marker to the same height as the lowest center line marker. Make sure these center lines are no higher than 3.5 feet from the ground.\n\n3. Back the Car Away from the Wall\n\nUse a tape measure to make sure you back the car exactly 25 feet from the wall. Turn off the headlights. It\u2019s now time to make your adjustments. Remove each headlight\u2019s trim ring and locate the headlight adjustment screws. You should notice marks for both the horizontal adjuster and vertical adjuster. If you\u2019re having trouble finding any of these features, refer to the owner\u2019s manual. You can then adjust each headlight separately using a screwdriver in and the adjustment screws. Remember to block out the light from one headlight while adjusting the other using a heavy fabric or object; having both headlights shining against the wall can make it difficult to distinguish between them.\n\n4. Adjust the Vertical Field\n\nIf you can enlist an assistant, have someone sit in the driver\u2019s seat to turn the lights off and on as you make your adjustments. When turning the vertical field\u2019s screw or bolt, turning clockwise typically raises the lights while turning counterclockwise lowers them. Your model, however, might work differently, so check the owner\u2019s manual. When adjusting the headlights, the most intense part of the beam should hit at or just below the center tape line you created on the wall.\n\n5. Adjust the Horizontal Field\n\nDo the same thing with the horizontal field as you did with the vertical one. Turn the side screws or bolts carefully until the most intense part of the headlight beam is just to the right of the tape\u2019s vertical line. You can then check to see if both headlights line up close enough to the tape marks you\u2019ve created on the wall. Continue to make any necessary adjustments until they look right.\n\n6. Perform a Road Test\n\nAfter making any headlight adjustments, test the alignment on the road at night. Simply take the car for a test drive and note any problem areas. You can then readjust as needed. Adjusting your car\u2019s headlights is a straightforward job. Adhere to recommended instructions and test the alignment as you go to ensure your beams are precisely where you need them to be.",

        "title": "What Do P0171\u202fand PO174 Mean?",
        "content": "Your bank 1 or bank 2 sensors will be referred to as \u201csensor 1\u201d or \u201csensor 2\u201d. Sensor 1 refers to \u201cupstream\u201d sensors, or the ones near the engine and before the catalytic converter. Sensor 2 is \u201cdownstream\u201d or after the converter. These upstream sensors verify the correct air/fuel ratio is entering the engine cylinders by measuring the oxygen levels in the exhaust gases leaving the cylinders. This is done by a continual but changing voltage signal to the computer. A continual high voltage reading indicates a rich fuel mixture, not enough oxygen. A continual low voltage reading indicates a lean fuel mixture, too much oxygen. The optimal ratio is 14.7:1 (air:fuel).  When your\u202fpowertrain/engine control module\u202freceives a reading that indicates there\u2019s too much oxygen and the ratio is incorrect, it sends an error code P0171 or P0174. Depending on the problem, it may send both codes if the issue is causing a lean condition on both engine banks. It\u2019s important to note here, the very nature of the oxygen sensor sending these codes, without any other oxygen sensor fail-codes tells us the sensor is working as it should. What makes this code tricky is if this code appears by itself, there is NOT a monitored component that has failed, or it would be getting a code as well. In short, the engine is running lean, but the computer cannot tell why.\nP0171 and P0174 Symptoms\nIn many instances engine performance issues are not exhibited. However, some lean situations can cause your vehicle to have these performance problems:\nSurging or hesitating acceleration Misfires (which will usually set a misfire code) Spark knock or detonation Reduced power Rough idle \nMore commonly, you\u2019ll only be alerted by the presence of an illuminated CEL. Look for one of these common causes to determine how to solve the problem code. \nThe first thing to determine is what other codes are present? If either code arrives (or both) at the same time as, say, a Mass Airflow Sensor code, it\u2019s a logical step to assume the MAF sensor may be causing the lean condition. If either P0171 or P0174 is appearing by itself, or both codes are stored, you have a problem that requires more detective work, and you must look beyond sensors and items monitored by the engine\u2019s computer.\nCommon Causes\nThere are many minor or major repairs that could create this issue. Start with the easiest issues and work your way through to identify the cause of your problem code. Lean conditions are often caused by air entering the system somewhere where it cannot be monitored. Two main areas for this would be the intake system, usually after the MAF sensor, or a vacuum leak somewhere in the intake. Start by checking the intake boot from the MAF to the throttle body. Inspect for cracks, loose hose clamps, or anywhere air could enter. Next, check over all the vacuum hoses on the engine for any cracks or breaks in the hose. While the engine is running, listen carefully as often you can hear a major vacuum leak from the sound of air being sucked through a break. Check the entire PCV system of hoses for leaks or cracks as well.\nIf nothing pops up here, there are other major issues that could be occurring. One is a vacuum leak due to a failed intake manifold or throttle body gasket. This will cause a major vacuum leak and trigger a lean condition. Another possible issue is improper fueling, which could be caused by low fuel pressure (potentially a fuel pressure regulator, or clogged pump strainer in the tank, or weak pump), or weak / plugged / misfiring fuel injectors. Its important to note that usually fuel issues such as these will often trigger a misfire code as well \u2013 either random or on particular cylinders.\nHow to Fix P0171 and P0174\n\nOnce the sensor is cleaned and working properly, and all your hoses and intake have been checked over, a vacuum test on the engine while running is the next step. A vacuum diagnostic gauge can be hooked up and used, or a professional shop can help at this point. If the vacuum is out of parameters or fluctuating wildly, it is likely there is a hidden breakage in a hose, or the intake manifold gasket is suspect.\nOnce you find the solution and repair or replace the appropriate part, check your vacuum and reset your trouble code to test whether you\u2019ve fixed the issue or need to look for further vacuum leaks. \n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone",

        "title": "How To Tell If Your Mass Air Flow Sensor Is Bad",
        "content": "How the MAF sensor works\n\nMAF sensors are located between the air filter and the throttle body and are responsible for measuring the amount of air entering the engine.\nMost vehicles have a hot wire MAF sensor. It has one heated wire and one ambient temperature wire. The microprocessor inside the MAF sensor measures the air entering the engine by maintaining the temperature of the hot wire 200\u00b0F above the ambient incoming air. The energy required to maintain the sensor at the same temperature is calculated and sent to the powertrain control module (PCM). The PCM then controls the injectors to deliver the specific amount of fuel that\u2019s proportional to the airflow, creating an air fuel mixture that, ideally, is perfect for your engine.\n\n3 SYMPTOMS OF A BAD MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR\n\n1. YOUR CAR HESITATES OR SUDDENLY JERKS FORWARD WHILE ACCELERATING\n\nA bad MAF sensor can cause your vehicle to experience poor drivability issues such as engine stalling, jerking or hesitation during acceleration. This could happen while speeding up on the highway on-ramp or cruising down a city street. These issues can create dangerous situations causing accidents and injury. If you experience any of these symptoms you should examine your vehicle as soon as possible.\n\n2. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO RICH\n\nYour vehicle needs the proper ratio of fuel to air in each combustion cylinder. Running rich means there is too much fuel and not enough air. Signs that your vehicle is running rich include:\n\nBlack smoke exiting the tailpipe\nWorse fuel efficiency than usual\nRough idling\nCheck Engine Light\n\n3. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO LEAN\n\nRunning lean is the opposite of running rich. It means your vehicle has too little fuel and too much air. Similar to running rich, the MAF sensor is sending inaccurate information to the PCM. This time underestimating the amount of airflow instead of overestimating it.\nAlthough this will temporarily improve your fuel efficiency, running lean for too long can seriously damage your vehicle. You may experience:\n\nEngine hesitation and/or surging\nHard engine seizures\nHard starting\nCheck Engine Light\n\nAs with other MAF sensor problems, the solution may be as simple as cleaning the wires. However, it\u2019s also a good idea to have a mechanic check your vehicle for damage.\n\n4. YOUR OBD-II SCANNER GETS\u00a0CODE P0101\n\nIf your\u00a0Check Engine Light is on, use a code reader to see what diagnostic trouble codes the system puts your way. If you don\u2019t have a code reader, stop by AutoZone to use our free Fix Finder program.\nThis Code\u2019s full read out is: P0101 \u2013 Mass Air Flow Sensor Circuit Range/Performance.\nThe engine computer uses the MAF sensor signal to determine how much fuel needs to be injected to meet the proper air-fuel ratio. The MAF sensor signal is also used to calculate engine load, meaning it can cause trouble for the traction control system, or change the automatic shifting pattern in applicable vehicles. This code is most commonly caused by a dirty, obstructed, or faulty MAF sensor, but can also be caused by issues including:\n\nDamage to the intake boot\nVacuum leaks\nClogged or improperly installed engine air filter\nClogged-up cat converter or restricted exhaust\n\nBecause there are other potential causes besides the bad MAF sensor, it\u2019s worth looking into these other possibilities so you are positive this code is being caused by the sensor before you go about replacing it.\n\nA malfunctioning MAF sensor may cause your vehicle to jerk during acceleration, run too rich, or run too lean. Make sure to fix the problem right away so you can be safe, avoid costly repairs, save money at the pump, and avoid being stranded on the road. Be sure to take a look at the mass air flow sensor before replacing it, you may only need to clean your MAF. Stop by your local AutoZone for advice on symptoms of a bad MAF sensor.\n\nShop MAF Sensors",

These are found in some Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Lexus vehicles and can\u2019t be cleaned with MAF Sensor Cleaner.\n\nHow to Clean a Mass Air Flow Sensor\n\n1. Unplug the Sensor\n\nTurn the engine off, remove the keys from the ignition, and let the engine cool. Locate the mass air flow sensor by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. Unplug the part from the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.\n\n2. Remove the Sensor\n\nWith the sensor unplugged, loosen the clamps and any brackets holding it in place. Slide the sensor assembly away from the tubing and carefully remove from the air intake boot(s).\n\n3. Clean the Sensor\n\nPlace the sensor on a towel for cleaning. Apply the cleaner \u2014 10-15 blasts around the inside of the sensor will do. Also clean the sides of the part, its housing, its connectors, and its terminals. If you have a hot wire mass air flow sensor, make sure the cleaner doesn\u2019t get onto the hot wires or plate.\n\n4. Reattach the Sensor\n\nAllow the sensor to dry. This should only take a few seconds. Once the part is ready, you can re-install it back into place, reattach and tighten the clamps/brackets. Once you\u2019ve re-installed the sensor, wait a few minutes before starting the vehicle to ensure the cleaning chemicals have evaporated.\n\n5. How Often Should You Clean the Air Flow Sensor\n\nIt\u2019s safe to clean the sensor every time you change the air filter. The job is simple enough to be a part of your routine maintenance. If your check engine light comes on and there\u2019s a trouble-code related to the MAF, that would definitely be a good time to clean the sensor.

        "title": "Symptoms of a Cracked Oil Pan",
        "content": "Understanding the Importance of the Oil Pan\n\nThe oil pan, also known as the oil sump, acts as a reservoir and a distribution point for the engine\u2019s oil. It ensures that the oil pump can supply oil to all components that need lubrication.\nWhen your vehicle is running, the oil pump takes oil from the pan and circulates it through the engine. The oil pan helps this process in several key ways:\n\nIt stores a reserve of oil, ensuring that the engine doesn\u2019t run dry during normal operation, and that there\u2019s always a ready supply for the oil pump.\nBy holding a significant portion of the engine oil, the oil pan helps to dissipate the heat that the oil absorbs from engine operation.\nThe bottom of the oil pan is designed to collect any sediment or debris that may be in the oil, preventing it from circulating through the engine and causing damage.\n\nThe oil pan location near the lowest part of the engine is intentional. It\u2019s positioned to collect and store oil that drains down from the top sections of the engine, ensuring that gravity works in the engine\u2019s favor to deliver lubrication where it\u2019s most needed.\n\nCommon Symptoms of a Cracked Oil Pan\n\nA cracked oil pan can lead to significant issues that go beyond mere oil leakage. Recognizing the signs early is key to preventing severe engine damage.\n\nOil leaks \u2013 One of the most apparent and immediate symptoms of a cracked oil pan is an oil leak. You may notice oil spots on your driveway or in your parking space, and it\u2019s often accompanied by a drop in oil pressure as the engine loses the oil it needs to operate.\nEngine noises \u2013 In more advanced cases, a cracked oil pan can cause the engine to make loud knocking or ticking noises as there\u2019s insufficient oil to provide a barrier between moving parts.\u00a0\nWarning lights \u2013 Watch for the oil pressure warning light on your dashboard, which could indicate a drop in oil levels, potentially due to a cracked oil pan.\nDecreased performance \u2013 A vehicle with a low oil level or inadequate oil pressure may not perform as well due to increased friction and the engine\u2019s inability to operate within its designed parameters, not to mention a lack of lubrication for the turbocharger or supercharger.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring a Cracked Oil Pan\n\nIf a cracked oil pan is left unchecked, it can lead to severe consequences for your vehicle\u2019s engine and, by extension, the safety of your car. It can cause parts to overheat and wear faster than they should. This can lead to catastrophic engine failure, which is not only costly but also dangerous, potentially leaving you stranded on the side of the road.\nOil leaking onto hot engine components can lead to fires. While this is rare, it\u2019s a risk that should be taken seriously.\nAlso, oil is a hazardous substance, and significant leaks can cause environmental damage and a mess on your driveway or garage floor. This is a consideration for all drivers, but especially those who live or work in areas with strict environmental regulations.\n\nDIY Inspection and Maintenance Tips\n\nEarly detection of a cracked oil pan can save you a lot of money and headache. During your routine oil changes, take the time to inspect the oil pan for signs of damage. Look for oil residue or a wet, greasy film on the pan\u2019s surface, which may indicate a crack or a weak spot. A slow leak can collect dirt and grime, so pay attention for that too.\nIf you notice a small crack and need a temporary solution, there are patching materials like adhesive compounds available that can be applied to the exterior of the pan. However, this should not be seen as a long-term fix, but rather a stop-gap measure to keep your vehicle operational until you can get it repaired properly.\n\nSeeking Professional Help\n\nWhen the crack is severe and you aren\u2019t comfortable fixing it yourself or you don\u2019t have the time, a professional mechanic can help. Seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job. They have the expertise and tools to resolve the issue effectively.\nThe most appropriate repair in most cases is an oil pan replacement. Patches like JB Weld may not hold permanently, and welding a crack in an oil pan may be either impossible due to the type of material, or it could warp the pan and prevent it from sealing well.\nThe cost of repairing a cracked oil pan will vary depending on the make and model of your vehicle, as well as the severity of the damage. Replacing an oil pan can be a labor-intensive process due to its location on most vehicles, leading to higher repair costs. Expect a parts and labor charge of between $400 and $1,200, and account for new engine oil and a filter while you\u2019re at it.\nOnce you\u2019re back in business, there are ways to avoid future issues. Regularly inspect your oil pan, use caution when driving over rough terrain, and install a skid plate or an engine undershield to help avoid impact to the oil pan.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Fix a Stripped Oil Drain Plug",
        "content": "Understanding the Issue\n\nThe first step in resolving any problem is finding the source. However, identifying a stripped oil drain plug isn\u2019t as elusive as other car problems. You might notice a slow leak of oil, realize it as something that needs attention, and on inspection, you may find that the drain plug skips when you try to tighten it or there are drips hanging from the plug despite being tight. The signs aren\u2019t subtle and should be addressed immediately.\nWhy the urgency? Allowing an oil drain plug to perpetually drip spells disaster, not just for your driveway, but for the health of your engine. Oil isn\u2019t just a lubricant. It\u2019s a coolant, a cleaner, and a rust inhibitor. Neglecting to stem the leak can lead to critical components running dry, overheating, and potentially allowing the engine to seize.\n\nGathering Your Tools and Materials\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to get your drain plug fixed up:\n\nA car jack and jack stands\nWrenches and sockets\nWork gloves and protective eyewear\nAnti-seize lubricant\nA torque wrench\nHelicoil kit\nPossible replacement gaskets or sealing rings\n\nMethods for Fixing a Stripped Oil Drain Plug\n\nWhen it comes to rectifying a stripped oil drain plug, a few methods exist, each tailored to the degree of damage and personal preference.\n\nRe-threading the Drain Plug\n\nThis method is suitable for less severe stripping. It involves using a thread-chaser tool to create new threads. It\u2019s less invasive and cost-effective, but should only be performed if the damage is minimal. The good news is that if you try this method and it doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re not out any additional parts \u2013 just a bit of oil.\n\nUsing Oversized Drain Plugs\n\nInstalling an oversized drain plug compensates for the lost thread depth. However, keep in mind that this should only be a temporary remedy and not a permanent fix, and locating an oversized plug is a matter of trial and error rather than finding an accurate part listed for the job.\n\nHelicoil Installation\n\nA helicoil inserts a coiled-wire thread that provides a stronger grip than traditional threads. This is a more permanent solution for moderate to severe stripping but may require more technical know-how.\u00a0\nReplacing the Oil Pan\n\nIf the threads are badly stripped out of the oil pan and a helicoil isn\u2019t an option or isn\u2019t preferred, you may need to purchase and install a new engine oil pan. It\u2019s a permanent repair, and it ensures the drain plug moves freely on the threads while being able to tighten well to the appropriate torque.\n\nStep-by-Step Repair Guide\n\nNow that you understand the methods, it\u2019s time to get your hands dirty. We\u2019ll guide you step-by-step through each approach to fixing a stripped oil drain plug.\n\nRe-threading Technique\n\nStart by draining the oil completely. Always work with a cool engine and drain pan at the ready.\n\nRemove the damaged oil drain plug and clean the area thoroughly.\n\nUse the thread-chaser tool to align and reform the existing threads. It\u2019s crucial here not to cross-thread it. Patience is your friend.\n\nOnce you have clean threads, it\u2019s time to reinstall the oil drain plug. Ensure a proper fit and tighten to manufacturer specifications with a torque wrench, but don\u2019t over-torque it.\n\nOversized Drain Plug Installation\n\nJust like the re-threading process, begin by draining the oil completely.\n\nSelect the appropriate oversized drain plug for your vehicle\u2019s pan.\n\nThread the new oversized drain plug carefully into the pan, making sure it aligns properly and doesn\u2019t cross-thread.\n\nTorque it down to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\n\nInstalling a Helicoil\n\nDrain the oil and remove the damaged plug.\n\nOnce cleaned, drill out the stripped area to the appropriate size for the helicoil you\u2019re using.\n\nTap the new hole with the supplied tap.\n\nInsert the helicoil and thread it in place.\n\nReinstall the oil drain plug and torque it down correctly.\n\nReplacing the Oil Pan\u00a0\n\nDrain the engine oil completely.\n\nRemove the oil pan according to your vehicle\u2019s repair guide.\n\nClean the engine mounting surface completely before installing your new parts.\n\nApply sealant or the oil pan gasket, then bolt the new oil pan in place to the right torque spec.\n\nInstall the drain plug into the oil pan, once again, using the correct torque spec.\n\nPreventive Measures\n\nPrevention is worth a pound of cure. To keep your drain plug in peak condition, remember these tips:\n\nAlways use the correct tools, and don\u2019t over-tighten.\nEach oil change, swap out the drain plug washer or gasket if recommended by the manufacturer, as these are the first line of defense against leaks and help prevent over-tightening.\nHave a professional mechanic verify the plug\u2019s condition after any significant service.\n\nLooking after your oil drain prevents leaks before they become a problem. Routinely inspect under your car for any signs of oil, and remember that regular oil changes are essential for overall engine health and can prevent issues with the drain plug. During every oil change, take a moment to examine the plug and its threads.\nNeed the tools or parts to repair a stripped oil drain plug?

        "title": "Does Cold Weather Affect Motor Oil?",
        "content": "Understanding the Cold Weather Challenge\n\nWhen winter sets in, it brings about unique challenges for your vehicle\u2019s engine. One of the critical elements affected by cold weather is motor oil viscosity, which refers to the thickness or flowability of the oil. Cold temperatures cause the oil to thicken, potentially leading to difficulties circulating oil around the engine through the tiny channels in the block.\nCan oil freeze? It doesn\u2019t become solid like ice, but it won\u2019t flow well. Imagine molasses or honey on a chilly morning, and how it moves sluggishly. Similarly, cold oil may struggle to reach all the vital engine components promptly.\nCold starts become a significant concern in winter. If thick oil doesn\u2019t flow as quickly as needed during startup, crucial engine parts can be starved of lubrication and get damaged. This can result in increased friction, reduced fuel efficiency, and potentially costly repairs.\n\nChoosing the Right Motor Oil for Winter\n\nChoosing the right motor oil for winter is paramount to ensure your vehicle runs smoothly in cold weather. Manufacturers specify recommended oil viscosities for different temperature ranges. In colder climates, it\u2019s advisable to opt for oil with a lower viscosity. Lower viscosity oils flow more easily in cold temperatures, facilitating quicker startups and better lubrication.\n\nCold Weather Maintenance Tips\n\nWinterizing your vehicle is essential to mitigate the impact of cold weather on motor oil and overall engine performance. One crucial aspect is the frequency of oil changes. In colder climates, it\u2019s a good idea to adhere to a more frequent oil change schedule. Ideally, change the oil at least twice a year: once before the start of winter, and again when the weather changes to summer. Do the oil change even more frequently if your maintenance guide requires it. This helps ensure that your engine is always lubricated by fresh, high-quality oil.\nWarming up the engine before hitting the road is a good practice in cold weather. Just a few minutes of idling before you start driving allows oil to circulate without the added stress of accelerating, and it\u2019s safe to drive before the interior warms up. Additionally, consider using a block heater to help keep the engine\u2019s fluids warm overnight. This not only aids in easier startups but also contributes to overall fuel efficiency during winter.\n\nSigns of Motor Oil Issues in Cold Weather\n\nCold weather can exacerbate existing issues or lead to new problems with motor oil. One common concern is oil sludging, where dirty oil thickens and forms sludge due to prolonged exposure to low temperatures. This can clog vital passages and result in poor engine performance.\nWatch out for symptoms of issues with motor oil during winter. They can include:\n\nIncreased engine noises like ticking or knocking, particularly on startup\nReduced fuel efficiency since the engine needs more power to overcome resistance from cold oil\nTrouble starting the engine because the oil is too thick to let the parts move\n\nTo prevent these issues, consider using synthetic oils that are less prone to thickening in cold temperatures. Regularly check the oil level and condition to catch potential problems early and address them right away.\n\nDIY Cold-Weather Oil Change Guide\n\nPerforming an oil change during winter requires some additional considerations.\n\nFirst, choose a sheltered and warm location to work on your vehicle.\nHave the right tools and equipment on hand including a drain pan, wrenches, a funnel, your winter oil, and an oil filter.\nRun the engine for about a minute to warm it prior to draining, ensuring it flows better.\nDrain the oil and change the filter per usual, allowing the oil to fully drain from the crankcase before re-installing the drain plug.\nAfter adding the oil, run the engine for a minute to let it fully circulate and warm then check the level to top it up.\n\nDon\u2019t forget your own comfort and safety too. Consider using gloves and wearing warm clothing to make the experience more comfortable, especially in frigid conditions.\nYour local AutoZone has a wide range of motor oils specifically designed for winter conditions. Remember, taking proactive steps in winterizing your vehicle can go a long way in preventing cold weather-related engine problems.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Your Engine Is Losing Horsepower and Fuel Economy: Here's Why",
        "content": "How and where do deposits form?\n\nYour internal combustion engine (ICE) contains pistons that are specifically designed to do a few vital things. First, they seal the combustion chamber, allowing the gases produced by burning fuel to build pressure and transfer energy to the crankshaft, ultimately turning your wheels. However, they also control the motor oil flow throughout the cylinder to provide critical lubrication and reduce friction as your engine runs.\nThe diagram below labels the grooves where each piston ring is located. Take a closer look to see what each part of a piston does:\n\nThe compression ring keeps the gases, produced by burning fuel, in the combustion chamber.\nThe wiper ring wipes excess oil away from the cylinder wall to form a thin lubrication layer to decrease friction as the piston moves.\nThe oil control ring ensures that the majority of the oil in the crankshaft stays down below the cylinder.\n\nIt is your pistons\u2019 job to control motor oil distribution and maximize combustion effectiveness in your engine.\nWhen your engine runs, some gas created in the combustion process slips by the piston rings and recirculates through the engine \u2014 these stray gases are called \u201cblow-by.\u201d The blow-by gases contain unburnt fuel, water, particulates, and unwanted decomposition products. As gas is cycled through the crankcase, it can be absorbed into the oil, ultimately leading to the formation of sludge, soot, and chemical species that can lead to deposit formation.\nAs that blow-by effect compounds on itself over time, piston surfaces get dirtier and dirtier, so the once-smooth movement of the piston within the cylinder can be disrupted. This leads to increased friction and decreased critical heat removal, which can in turn reduce horsepower, lower fuel economy, and inhibit acceleration.\n\nClean piston with minimal deposit formation\n\nPiston after deposits have formed\n\nFrom the moment it leaves the factory, your engine begins building up harmful deposits that are nearly impossible to reverse.

That can include valve cover gaskets, the rear main oil seal, and many others. Over time, they can wear out or become brittle, leading to oil leaks. Regular inspection during routine maintenance can prevent potential issues by catching them early.\n\nDamaged Oil Pan\n\nThe oil pan under your engine can suffer damage from road debris or accidents. A punctured or cracked oil pan can result in significant oil leaks. Inspect your oil pan for any visible damage and replace it if necessary. Or, it could simply be the seal has aged and cracked or become unsealed.\n\nLoose or Faulty Oil Filters\n\nOil filters trap impurities and prevent them from circulating through your engine. A loose or damaged oil filter can cause leaks. When changing your oil, ensure the filter is properly secured and consider using a quality filter to minimize the risk of leaks.\n\nOverfilled Oil Levels\n\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, overfilling your oil can lead to leaks. Excess oil can create excessive pressure in the system, causing gaskets and seals to fail. Follow your vehicle manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for oil capacity to prevent overfilling.\n\nAccidental Spill\n\nIf you\u2019ve topped up the engine oil recently, there\u2019s a possibility oil has spilled on the exterior. As it finds its way to the bottom of the engine, drips can look like an active leak but all that\u2019s needed is a good cleanup with a degreaser.\n\nDangers of Ignoring Oil Leaks\n\nIt\u2019s never a good idea to ignore oil spots you\u2019ve noticed. If you do, there may be serious implications.\nLong-term oil leaks can result in poor lubrication for engine components, leading to increased friction and wear. This can ultimately cause irreversible damage, reducing engine performance and lifespan.\nOil leaks are not just a concern for your vehicle; they also pose environmental risks. Oil that drips onto the ground can contaminate soil and water, harming the environment. It can also create slippery road conditions, posing a hazard to both you and other drivers. Additionally, if oil drips onto your exhaust system, it can lead to smoke and potential fire risks. Ensuring your vehicle is leak-free contributes to safer driving conditions.\n\nDIY Oil Leak Detection and Prevention\n\nYou should stay on top of vehicle maintenance and inspections to keep oil leaks at bay, or at the very least, address them right away.\n\nPerform regular undercarriage inspections to identify oil leaks early. Look for wet spots, stains, or fresh drips.\u00a0\nRegularly check your oil levels using the dipstick. Ensure the oil is within the recommended range and appears clean. Dark, gritty oil may indicate contamination or the need for an oil change.\nFollow a consistent and proper oil change schedule. Using the right type and quality of oil is crucial. Regular oil changes with high-quality oil can maintain engine health and prevent leaks.\nConsider using oil leak detection products, such as additives or dye tablets. These can help pinpoint the source of a leak by making it more visible. However, address the root cause rather than relying solely on these products.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nIf you notice persistent or severe oil leaks and can\u2019t determine the source, or if it\u2019s outside the scope of your abilities, it\u2019s time to seek professional assistance. Check out one of our Preferred Shops whose qualified mechanics can conduct a thorough inspection to identify and rectify the issue.\nUnusual noises coming from your engine, such as knocking or tapping sounds, or a sudden loss of oil pressure as indicated by warning lights or gauge readings, demands immediate attention.

        "title": "Understanding Engine Oil Color: What Does it Mean?",
        "content": "Decoding Engine Oil Colors\n\nEngine oil can be a variety of colors, each offering clues about the condition of your vehicle\u2019s engine. From the pristine clarity of new oil to the darker hues developed over time, the color of your engine oil can tell a story about what\u2019s happening under the hood.\nTo begin deciphering what it all means, let\u2019s distinguish between normal and abnormal oil colors. Normal oil often starts with a golden or amber hue, representing its fresh and clean state. It looks like liquid honey. As oil ages and accumulates contaminants, it may gradually darken, transitioning from light amber to darker shades.\n\nThe Golden Standard: Clear Engine Oil\n\nClear or golden engine oil is the gold standard. This color indicates that the oil is new or close to it and doing its job effectively, lubricating the engine components and keeping them well-protected. Fresh oil provides the best viscosity and lasting coverage, ensuring smooth engine operation and maximum fuel efficiency.\nTo maintain this golden color, regular oil changes are crucial. Follow your vehicle manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for oil change intervals, and always use the recommended oil grade. Additionally, consider using high-quality synthetic oils that tend to maintain their clarity for a more extended period.\n\nRed Flags: Dark Engine Oil\n\nAs oil circulates through the engine, it collects contaminants such as dirt, metal particles, and combustion byproducts like carbon and sludge. This accumulation leads to the gradual darkening of the oil. However, the rate at which oil darkens depends on various factors, including driving conditions, engine age, and the type of oil used.\nWhile some darkening is normal, excessively dark or black oil may indicate issues such as poor maintenance, overheating, a misfire, or internal engine problems. Ignoring this warning sign could lead to reduced engine performance, increased friction, and ultimately, engine damage. Regular oil changes and routine engine inspections can help prevent such issues.\nThe exception is for diesel engines. The soot the engines produce will very quickly turn golden oil almost black, but it can continue to protect against damage for a long time in that condition as long as the correct oil and oil filter are used.\n\nMilky or Frothy Oil: What\u2019s Wrong?\n\nIf you notice that your engine oil has taken on a milky or frothy appearance, it\u2019s a cause for concern. This abnormal color suggests the presence of water or coolant in the oil. It sometimes looks like a chocolate milkshake. You might see this when checking the oil on the dipstick or as a milky, foamy residue on the oil cap.\nMilky oil is a clear indicator of the presence of water and is a potential internal issue, such as a leaking head gasket or a cracked engine block. Water or coolant mixing with oil can compromise the lubricating properties of the oil, leading to increased friction, oxidation on internal parts, and the risk of severe engine damage. If you suspect coolant contamination, it\u2019s crucial to address the issue promptly to avoid costly repairs.\n\nThe Green or Blue Dilemma: Coolant Contamination\n\nA distinct green or blue tint in your engine oil is a sign of coolant contamination. This coloration occurs when coolant leaks into the oil system, often due to a damaged head gasket, a cracked cylinder head, or a faulty engine oil cooler.\nIf you identify coolant contamination, it\u2019s essential to address the underlying issue promptly. Ignoring this problem can lead to corrosion, decreased lubrication, and potential engine failure. Diagnose and repair the source of the coolant leak, involving a professional mechanic if you aren\u2019t comfortable doing the job yourself. Regular coolant system inspections can help prevent this type of contamination.\nUnderstanding engine oil color is a valuable skill for any vehicle owner. By paying attention to the colors and identifying potential issues early on, you can protect your engine and extend its lifespan. Remember, regular maintenance, timely oil changes, and prompt attention to any unusual colors can keep your engine running smoothly for miles to come.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

It\u2019s been chemically engineered through the refining process for a more uniform molecular shape that provides more even protection between moving parts. It contains premium additives to resist oxidation and reduce friction, as well as excellent detergents to help keep and engine clean inside. Many high-performance motors require fully synthetic oil as the minimum standard for every oil change.\nOne of the main benefits is its ability to provide superior engine protection and performance compared to conventional or blended oils. Full synthetic oil also has a longer lifespan, which means fewer oil changes and more money saved in the long run.\nHowever, drawbacks include a higher price point and sometimes compatibility issues with certain car models. Plus, although it can protect for longer, it doesn\u2019t extend your oil change intervals, so your maintenance costs will be higher.\n\nSynthetic Blend Motor Oil: Benefits and Drawbacks\n\nSynthetic blend motor oil has become a popular choice among drivers in recent years, offering a combination of benefits and drawbacks. It contains a mixture of synthetic oil and conventional oil, providing the best of both worlds.\nOn the positive side, synthetic blend oil provides better performance and protection than conventional oil, particularly in extreme temperatures and heavy loads. It also contains fewer impurities, which can help improve longevity and reduce engine wear.\nSome vehicles require synthetic blend oil as the lowest grade of oil that should be used, as is the case for many compact, fuel-efficient vehicles with turbochargers or superchargers. However, it is more expensive than conventional oil and may not be necessary for all vehicles. Also, synthetic blend oil may not provide the same level of protection as fully synthetic oil, particularly in severe driving conditions. Ultimately, the decision to use synthetic blend oil depends on the vehicle\u2019s minimum requirements as well as the driver\u2019s individual preferences.\n\nWhich is Better: Synthetic Blend or Full Synthetic Motor Oil?\n\nOne of the most common debates in car maintenance is a battle of synthetic blend vs full synthetic motor oil, and which is better. While both have their advantages and disadvantages, the decision ultimately depends on personal preference and the type of car being driven.\nSynthetic blend motor oil combines conventional oil with synthetic oil, offering a cheaper but still high-quality option for drivers who want the benefits of synthetic oil without breaking the bank.\nFull synthetic motor oil, on the other hand, is a more expensive but high-performing option that offers superior protection and fuel efficiency.\nUltimately, it\u2019s up to the driver to weigh the pros and cons and make the best decision for their vehicle and budget.",

        "content": "Check your windshield wiper blades\u00a0\n\nCheck your windsheild wipers\nWiper blades can freeze to the windshield in a snowstorm, and ice and snow on the glass can act as an abrasive on the rubber edge. Check along the flexible rubber edge of each wiper blade for nicks and cuts. If you see damage, or if your wipers leave streaks behind after a pass, replace them both.\n\nInspect and top up the fluids\u00a0\n\nInspect and top fluids\nFluids can have moisture intrude or form from cycles between hot and cold temperatures. Contamination can occur, and oils can break down and lose viscosity. Check the color and level of each fluid including:\n\nEngine oil\nTransmission fluid\nEngine coolant\nBrake fluid\nPower steering fluid\nOn 4WD and AWD vehicles, differential and transfer case fluids\n\nIf they\u2019re in poor condition, flush and fill them with the appropriate fluids. Also, top up the windshield washer fluid.\n\nCheck the air filters\n\nCheck the air filters\nAlthough dust storms and bugs aren\u2019t the norm in the winter, the air still carries particles that will get caught in the air filters. Inspect the engine air filter as well as the cabin air filter to ensure they aren\u2019t coated in debris. Check that light passes through the pleats, indicating that air can still make its way through efficiently too. If the filters are dirty, smelly, or you can\u2019t see light through them, replace them. It\u2019s usually necessary every year as part of your vehicle maintenance schedule.\n\nTest the battery\n\nTest the Battery\n\nCheck the brakes\n\nCheck the brakes\nAs summer approaches, your brakes will need to be in good condition to bring your vehicle to a halt, and higher temperatures can cause brake pads and rotors to wear a little faster too. Make sure you\u2019re starting the season out right and that your brake pads have at least 3/16ths of an inch remaining at each wheel for both the inboard and outboard pad. Brake rotors shouldn\u2019t be gouged, and they shouldn\u2019t have ridges or pockmarks of rust on either side. If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process. Spark plugs, ignition cables, and fluid flushes may be due. It\u2019s best to follow the maintenance schedule provided by the manufacturer for major services.\nIf you complete the items on this spring car checklist, you\u2019ll help minimize the overall cost of repairs and prevent untimely issues from occurring.

        "title": "How Does an Oil Pump Work?",
        "content": "What is an Oil Pump?\n\nThe oil pump pressurizes the oil and sends it through the engine to lubricate and cool the moving parts such as the crankshaft, pistons, and bearings. This helps reduce friction and wear on these components, which prolongs the life of the engine. In fact, an engine that doesn\u2019t have a working oil pump will likely overheat and seize in a few minutes or less, causing irreversible damage to internal components.\nAn oil pickup tube draws oil up out of the oil pan sump and pushes it through oil galleys to the oil filter. Then, the oil carries on through thinner channels or galleys that feed lubricant to bearings, moving parts, and a stream that coats upper end components. It all drains back down to the oil pan where it\u2019s collected and goes through the process again. The oil pickup tube where it all starts is connected to the oil pump.\n\nHow Does it Work?\n\nThere are two main types of engine oil pumps: gear pumps and vane pumps.\nGear pumps use two gears that mesh together to create suction and pump the oil. The gears rotate, trapping oil between them and then pushing it through the pump\u2019s outlet. These pumps are typically used in older, mechanical engines.\nVane pumps use a rotor with sliding vanes to pump the oil. As the rotor spins, the vanes create suction that pulls oil into the pump. The vanes then move outward, compressing and pushing the oil through the pump\u2019s outlet. Vane pumps are typically used in newer, electronic engines and are often integrated into a front engine cover.\nBoth types of pumps are driven by the engine, whether by the crankshaft or camshaft, and can be either internal or external to the oil pan.\n\nWhat to Look Out for in Servicing Your Oil Pump\n\nIdentifying a bad oil pump is the first step. There are several signs that an engine oil pump may be failing:\n\nLow oil pressure. One of the most common signs of a failing oil pump is low oil pressure. This can be indicated by the oil pressure gauge or warning light on the dashboard, or by using a pressure tester during diagnosis.\n\nNoise from the engine. A failing oil pump can make a whining or ticking noise, especially when the engine is idling. It could be from hydraulic lifters that are oil-starved or bearings or pistons that are no longer protected by a film of oil.\nOverheating engine. A lack of oil pressure can cause the engine to overheat, as it is not being properly cooled.\nPoor performance. A failing oil pump can cause the engine to lose power, stall, or not start at all. It\u2019s often due to an oil-fed component like a turbocharger that stops working when it doesn\u2019t get enough oil.\nOil warning light. Some vehicles have a warning light that comes on to indicate low oil pressure, which may be caused by a failing oil pump.\nOil leaks. If there is an oil leak from front of the engine, it may be a sign of a problem with the pump.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that some of these signs can also be caused by other issues such as low oil level, clogged oil filter, or worn bearings, so it\u2019s crucial to diagnose the problem correctly to avoid further damage.\n\nWhat Causes a Bad Oil Pump?\n\nOil pumps are a sturdy design and, if your engine is properly maintained, it should last your car\u2019s entire lifetime. The primary point of failure for an oil pump is if oil changes aren\u2019t performed on time. Sludge and other contaminants or debris can get lodged in the pump or pickup tube, causing the pump\u2019s gears or vanes to wear prematurely.\nOperating your engine at high RPMs for extended periods can also contribute to early failure. As the oil heats up too much, it permanently loses its viscosity and the oil pump can experience wear, whether inside the pump or on the drive gear.\nIt\u2019s a big job to replace the oil pump on most vehicles. Along with draining the oil, the oil pan and front engine cover often need to be removed. But it\u2019s easy to help prevent failure in the first place by changing the engine oil regularly, and avoid over-revving your engine for long stretches.",

        "title": "Best Motor Oil Products For Your Car",
        "content": "What to Consider When Choosing Motor Oil\n\n\u00a0There are hundreds of products to sift through when you\u2019re looking for engine oil, and it can be tough to narrow it down. When choosing motor oil, you should consider the following factors:\n\nAPI rating \u2013 The American Petroleum Institute (API) assigns ratings to motor oils based on their performance characteristics. Look for the API starburst symbol on the oil container, and choose an oil with a rating appropriate for your vehicle\u2019s age and type. Look for motor oil with a high API rating, such as \u201cAPI SP\u201d or \u201cAPI SN Plus,\u201d which indicates that it meets the latest industry standards for performance and protection.\nViscosity \u2013 Choose the right viscosity grade for your vehicle\u2019s engine and the climate in which you drive. A common viscosity grade for most vehicles is 5W-30, but yours might need 5W-20, 0W-20, 5W-40, or something else. Check your owner\u2019s manual or the engine oil filler cap for the correct viscosity to use.\nSynthetic or conventional \u2013 Synthetic motor oil is generally more expensive but lasts longer and performs better in extreme temperatures. Conventional motor oil is less expensive but may need to be changed more frequently. And some vehicles require synthetic oil only, so be sure to check your car\u2019s literature for the correct oil specification.\nAdditives \u2013 Look for motor oil with additives that meet your vehicle\u2019s specific needs, such as those that provide extra wear protection, improve fuel efficiency, or clean the engine.\n\nTo assist with narrowing down the oil options for your vehicle, enter the year, make, model, and engine size to view oils that may be appropriate for use in your engine.\n\nConventional Oil Products\u00a0\n\nConventional engine oil, also known as mineral oil, is a lubricant made from naturally occurring hydrocarbons, which are refined from crude oil. It is the most common type of motor oil used in vehicles and has been used for decades.\nIt\u2019s made up of base oils and additives that are mixed together to create the final product. The base oils are refined from crude oil and are responsible for lubricating the engine, while the additives provide additional benefits such as improved engine cleanliness, better wear protection, and increased high-temperature stability. Conventional oils are inexpensive and are appropriate for most vehicles with naturally aspirated engines.\n\nSome of the Best Conventional Oils Available Include:\n\nSynthetic Oil Products\n\nSynthetic engine oil has a more uniform molecular structure and better performance in extreme temperatures and high-stress conditions. It\u2019s made by further refining the base crude oil and can also contain different chemically-made compounds.\nIt has better thermal stability, which means it can perform better at high temperatures and maintain its viscosity better than conventional oil. Synthetic oils also last longer, meaning they can go longer between oil changes, although it\u2019s not recommended to exceed the manufacturer\u2019s prescribed interval. They are also more resistant to breaking down under high engine loads and high temperatures, which leads to better engine protection.\nHowever, synthetic oil is also more expensive than conventional oil, and not all vehicles require synthetic oil. It\u2019s recommended to check the owner\u2019s manual or consult with the vehicle\u2019s manufacturer to determine if synthetic oil is recommended for your vehicle.\n\nTop Performers Among the Best Synthetic Oils Include:\n\nMobil 1 Full Synthetic Engine Oil\n\nAn engine oil that guarantees protection for up to 10,000 miles between oil changes, Mobil 1 Full Synthetic resists thermal breakdown and controls oxidation. It flows even in -40 degrees F and its additives prevent sludge deposits from forming.\n\nBuy Now \n\nSTP High Mileage Full Synthetic Oil\n\nIntended for gas-powered engines with more than 75,000 miles, STP SYN High Mileage contains detergents and additives to reduce engine wear, maintain fuel economy, and promote turbocharger health on older engines. It\u2019s available in several viscosities compatible with API SN and lower.\n\nBuy Now \n\nValvoline MaxLIfe High Mileage Full Synthetic Oil\n\nAlso intended for cars with high mileage, Valvoline MaxLife Full Synthetic contains premium seal conditioners to prevent and help stop leaks as well as additives to protect better against wear. It\u2019s also hard on sludge buildup.\n\nBuy Now \n\nAre Oil Additives Worth It?\u00a0\n\nEngine oil additives are designed to reduce friction, promote cleaning, prevent foaming, and protect against wear, among other things. Some additive products are intended to stop leaks while others treat high-mileage engines that already have higher amounts of wear. But are they worth it?\nMost engine oils already contain additives like anti-foaming agents, detergents, and friction modifiers, but the best synthetic motor oil products contain higher-quality additives. Still, if you have a specialty vehicle or a specific use or condition you want to address, oil additives are a great choice to make your engine operate at its best.",

        "title": "How to Read an Oil Dipstick\u00a0",
        "content": "Why you need to check oil\u00a0\n\nWhen you rub clean, new engine oil from a container between your fingers, it feels clean and slippery. That\u2019s the basic premise for what it does inside the engine too \u2013 a slick liquid that keeps fast-moving metal parts separated with a lubricating film. But if you rub old, dark motor oil between your fingers, it feels gritty, and that\u2019s not healthy for an engine.\u00a0\u00a0\nEngine oil\u2019s condition needs to be checked to ensure it\u2019s fine to be used for longer, but there are other reasons to check oil too:\u00a0\u00a0\nAll engines consume oil. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect seal in the cylinders, and all engines will burn a little oil. Normal amounts of oil consumption are determined by the carmaker, and some tolerate up to one quart per 3,000 miles or as much as a quart per 1,000 miles.\u00a0\u00a0There could be an oil leak. It\u2019s possible for a leak to develop on your engine. Over time, the oil level can drop, and finding low oil levels can spur you to check for and discover the leak.\u00a0\u00a0It could be contaminated. If water finds its way into the engine, the oil will change from a translucent golden color to milky brown, and that moisture will promote corrosion in the crankcase.\u00a0\nIdeally, you\u2019d check your oil level and condition every time you fill your vehicle\u2019s fuel tank. However, it\u2019s more realistic to check oil dip sticks and top up the oil as required at least once per month.\u00a0\n\nHow to read dipstick oil levels\u00a0\n\nUsing a dipstick is how to check oil in car engines. The technique to check the oil is the same no matter the type of engine or dipstick you have, but the indicators on the dipstick can and do differ between makes and models.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Park on a level surface\n\nTo get an accurate reading, your car needs to be parked so it\u2019s level from front to back and side to side. Otherwise, the slanted oil level could give a deceiving measurement, leading you to over- or under-filling it.  \n\n2. Check the engine cold\n\nThe engine oil level should be checked at least 5 to 15 minutes after you\u2019ve parked your car and shut the engine off. That way, the oil has a chance to drain into the oil pan for an accurate measurement.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3. Pull out and clean the dipstick\n\nWith a clean lint-free towel or paper towel in hand, pull the dipstick out of the tube. Guide it out carefully, especially toward the end, or you could fling oil droplets onto yourself or around the engine bay. Wipe the oil off the dipstick with your towel.  \n\n4. Fully insert the dipstick\n\nPut the dipstick back into the tube, ensuring that it\u2019s inserted fully. If it isn\u2019t put in all the way, your reading will indicate lower than it actually is, and there\u2019s a risk of overfilling the engine oil. \n\n5. Remove and read the dipstick\n\nAgain, carefully remove the dipstick from its tube without touching the end. Support the dipstick halfway or so to stop it from bouncing around, making it hard to read and causing drips. Locate the indicators on the dipstick to determine your reading.\nIndicators can vary. Some carmakers have an F and L stamped on the dipstick, representing Full and Low. Others have a crosshatched section, Max and Min stampings, or simply a hole marking the low and high marks, and yours could be different still. In any case, it will be well defined on the bottom few inches.\n\nIf the oil shows at or near the Full mark, your level is fine.\nIf it\u2019s at or below the Low mark, you need to add engine oil.\nIf the oil level is between the marks, it\u2019s still in a normal range, although you may still want to add a little oil for peace of mind.\nIf you can\u2019t see any oil on the dipstick, there\u2019s a concerning issue.\n\nThe color of the oil should be somewhere between honey brown and amber with a gas engine. If it\u2019s darker, you\u2019re due for an oil change.\n\nHow to top off oil\u00a0\n\nNow that you know how to check oil, the next step is topping it off. Use the exact oil specification your engine needs \u2013 you\u2019ll find that on the oil filler cap in most cases or in the owner\u2019s manual. Remove the oil cap and place a funnel there. Don\u2019t try to fill in the dipstick tube as it\u2019s bound to make a mess!\u00a0\nIf your oil is below the Low mark, add a quart of oil and recheck. If it\u2019s in the normal range, add 1/4 of a quart at a time until it\u2019s at the Full mark. Be careful not to overfill the oil.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf your oil level is already overfilled or you accidentally add too much, you should drain some to bring it back into range.",

        "title": "What Oil Does My Car Take?",
        "content": "What Does Motor Oil Do?\n\nKnowing what roles motor oil plays in your engine\u2019s health can help to understand why choosing the right oil is so important. Oil is first and foremost recognized as a lubricant, keeping parts separated by a thin film of molecules that act like tiny ball bearings, preventing them from rubbing against each other. Not only is it a lubricant, but engine oil also:\u00a0\nCoats metal parts to prevent rust and oxidizationReduces friction between moving partsDissolves and washes away deposits and sludge from inside the crankcaseCirculates hot oil to the engine oil cooler to maintain the right operating temperatureNeutralizes acids created from the combustion process\nIf the wrong grade of oil is used, these protective qualities can be compromised.\u00a0\n\nFind the Correct Oil Grade\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers, or SAE, has developed a grading system for engine oil. One common grade is 5W-30 engine oil, and it can be generally explained for how it performs based on its grading.\u00a0\nThe first part of the number, 5W, indicates how well it pours in cold weather since the W stands for Winter. The lower the number, the better it flows in the cold. The second part of the number \u2013 in this case, the number 30 \u2013 indicates the oil weight at normal operating temperature. The higher this number, the thicker it is when it\u2019s warm.\u00a0\nThe grade you\u2019re looking for will be marked on your engine oil cap, in most cases. You\u2019ll also find it in your vehicle\u2019s routine maintenance guide booklet or online. If your manual gives two different possible grades, the one with the lower numbers is intended for winter driving. For example, a car might use 5W-20 engine oil in the summer but have 0W-20 oil recommended for winter.\n\nTypes of Motor Oil\n\nGrade is only one portion of the motor oil equation. Perhaps even more important is the type of oil you use in the engine. And if you\u2019re wondering, \u201cAre all engine oils the same?\u201d, no they are not. It\u2019s true that they may all start with a base oil that\u2019s refined from crude oil drawn from the ground, but there are some very distinct differences between oil types, even though you can\u2019t see them with the naked eye.\n\nConventional oil\n\nCrude oil extracted from the earth in a variety of ways needs to be refined before it can be used in an engine. Once impurities have been removed, it\u2019s mixed with detergents and additives that are intended to keep your engine clean and protected.\u00a0\nOnce conventional oil has been put into the engine and used, it begins to degrade. Within a matter of months or a few thousand miles, it will be saturated by contaminants and particles that would otherwise damage the engine, and it begins to lose its protective qualities. That\u2019s why oil changes are so important \u2013 it removes these harmful compounds from the engine for disposal.\n\nSynthetic oil\n\nContrary to popular belief, synthetic oil is not completely synthesized. It\u2019s formulated from crude oil, just like conventional oil is. However, the refining process is more thorough. Synthetic oil\u2019s molecules are a more consistent size, allowing for better protection against wear inside the engine. It\u2019s a higher quality base oil to start with, and that means it\u2019s more chemically stable, resists oxidization better, and won\u2019t lose its protective properties as soon.\u00a0\nCombined with a better base oil, synthetic engine oil also tends to have premium additives and detergents mixed in it. Because of that, synthetic oil keeps the engine cleaner, experiences less wear, works to protect at higher temperatures better than conventional oil, and doesn\u2019t degrade as quickly.\u00a0\n\nSynthetic blend\n\nThe problem with full synthetic engine oil is that it\u2019s expensive. A less costly option is a synthetic blend or semi-synthetic engine oil that offers similar benefits without such an expense. It starts with a mixture of synthetic and conventional base oils and receives additives and detergents, typically better than you\u2019d find in conventional oil. It\u2019s a popular choice for carmakers and service shops alike. And in most cars, it\u2019s become the minimum required grade.\n\nWhich Oil Should I Choose?\n\nThe minimum type of engine oil your car requires is specified in the maintenance guide, which you should always follow.\u00a0\nFor naturally aspirated cars, it\u2019s often conventional engine oil that\u2019s the minimum standard. However, if you\u2019d like extra protection for your engine, you can upgrade to semi-synthetic or full synthetic engine oil.\u00a0\nIf your car has a turbocharger or supercharger, or if you have a high-performance model, the required type of oil is often semi-synthetic or fully synthetic. You should not downgrade to conventional oil as it doesn\u2019t have the properties necessary to protect your engine as it needs.\n\nHow Often Should I Change My Oil?\n\nChanging oil is routine, but the interval should never be neglected or extended beyond what your maintenance guide says. You can expect longer intervals from synthetic oil, typically, since it doesn\u2019t degrade as easily, and 7,500 miles or more is common. For conventional oil, usually, an oil change should be performed every 3,000 to 5,000 miles.\nIf it\u2019s time for an engine oil and filter change on your car, buy your motor oil at AutoZone. Shop with your year, make, model, and engine size for the right oil options to keep your car running like new.\u00a0\n\nFAQs",

        "title": "How Often Should You Change Your Oil?",
        "content": "Understanding Oil Change Intervals\n\nKeep in mind that these guidelines typically provide a mileage range rather than an exact number. It\u2019s common to see recommendations like \u2018every 5,000 to 7,500 miles.\u2019 The exact interval within this range may depend on various factors, such as the type of oil used and your driving habits, which we\u2019ll explore shortly.\n\nThe Role of Oil Types in Interval Selection\n\nOil types play a significant role in determining how often you should change your oil. Two primary categories of engine oil are synthetic and conventional. Synthetic oil, although more expensive, generally offers better performance and durability. It typically lasts longer and provides superior protection against heat and engine wear, although that doesn\u2019t necessarily extend the interval if your car doesn\u2019t require synthetic.\nConventional oil, on the other hand, is more budget-friendly but usually requires more frequent changes. Depending on your vehicle\u2019s requirements and your budget, you may choose either option. Keep in mind that some vehicles may explicitly recommend synthetic oil or a synthetic blend, so always refer to your owner\u2019s manual first.\n\nFactors Influencing Oil Change Frequency\n\nOne of the most critical factors affecting your oil change frequency is your driving habits and the conditions you encounter on the road. If you primarily drive in stop-and-go traffic, tow heavy loads, or frequently travel on dusty, unpaved roads, your engine works harder and generates more contaminants that can degrade the oil. In such cases, you might need to change your oil more frequently, possibly closer to the lower end of the recommended interval.\nOn the other hand, if you have a daily commute on smooth highways and avoid extreme driving conditions, you might be able to stick to the longer end of the recommended interval. Remember, though, that even in ideal conditions, oil still degrades over time due to exposure to temperature variations and moisture.\nThe type of oil you choose also affects your oil change frequency. Synthetic oil\u2019s superior performance and resistance to breakdown mean it can last longer between changes. This can be a cost-effective choice in the long run, as you won\u2019t need to change it as frequently as conventional oil.\nHowever, if you opt for conventional oil due to cost, you should follow the lower end of the recommended interval. Regular oil changes become even more crucial when using conventional oil to ensure that your engine remains adequately protected.\n\nWhen Your Vehicle Needs an Oil Change\n\nThere are a few ways you can tell that your vehicle needs an oil change:\n\nThere\u2019s a warning light on. Some vehicles have an indicator like a wrench icon or a \u2018service required\u2019 message that illuminates on the dash when an oil change is due.\nThe oil life is below 10%. For vehicles with an oil life monitor, you\u2019ll want to change the oil before the percentage ticks all the way down to zero.\nYou\u2019ve reached the oil change sticker mileage/date. If you\u2019ve reached how many miles to change the oil according to the maintenance schedule, it\u2019s time to get it done.\nThe oil is dark, milky, gritty, or otherwise contaminated. If the oil condition is poor, you should change the oil regardless of when it was done last.\nThe engine is ticking or knocking, or the oil light is on. These are indicators that the oil level might be low or extremely dirty.\n\nRemember, changing your oil too frequently can\u2019t hurt, but waiting too long certainly can.\n\nConsequences of Neglecting Oil Changes\n\nIt\u2019s easy to let the oil change interval slip past longer than you should, but that\u2019s not healthy for your engine. The effects can be minor or devastating, including:\n\nEngine damage from lack of lubrication\nReduced performance as there\u2019s more resistance internally\nWorse fuel economy\nEngine overheating\nHigher maintenance and repair costs to deal with the neglect\nWorsening emissions\nAnd unreliability\n\nCan You Change Your Oil By Yourself?\n\nOnce your oil is changed, recycle your old oil so it doesn\u2019t contaminate the environment. Bring it to your local AutoZone store and we can dispose of it for you.\nBy doing an oil change yourself, you can save time and money compared to bringing it to a shop. But if you don\u2019t have the time to do it yourself, have it performed by a professional so you aren\u2019t getting behind on maintenance.\nReady to change your oil?

        "title": "How Much Oil Does My Car Need?",
        "content": "How Much Oil Does My Car Need?\n\nOil not only lubricates your engine\u2019s parts\u2014which keeps them from damaging each other\u2014 but also helps keep your engine cool. If your oil amount is too low, it could lead to issues in both these areas. Additionally, the oil must reach the top parts of your engine within seconds of your car starting to ensure those areas are lubricated and protected from damage.\u00a0However, if there\u2019s too much oil, it can froth and not effectively lubricate the various engine parts. For this reason, it\u2019s crucial to ensure you know how many quarts of oil are in your car and how much you need for cooling and lubrication.\nTypically, engines need five to eight quarts of oil. However, the size of your engine can impact how much oil is required. For example, a 4-cylinder oil engine may require around five quarts of oil, whereas a 6-cylinder oil needs six quarts. Usually, the smaller the engine is, the less oil you\u2019ll need for your vehicle.\n\nHow to Identify How Much Oil Your Car Needs\n\nHere are a few ways to check to see how much oil your car needs.\n\n1. Check the Owner\u2019s Manual\n\nThe first place you want to check is your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. There, it will typically mention the type of oil you need, the necessary viscosity or thickness, when you need to change it, and the amount you\u2019ll need. If you\u2019ve misplaced your owner\u2019s manual, you can go to your manufacturer\u2019s website and search through their collection of manuals. Sometimes, you may need to sign-up on the site or type in your vehicle\u2019s identification number to get it.\n\n2. Checking Product Manual\n\nThe next material that you want to check is the product manual. The product can give you a lot of information about whether oil is best for your car. Motor oil typically shows two numbers, making it a multi-grade oil. The first number reveals the viscosity or thickness at lower temperatures. If the number is lower, oil moves well in colder weather.\nThe second number shows how well the oil performs in higher temperatures.\u00a0 In warmer temperatures, oils can become thinner. Therefore, finding oil that can still adequately lubricate your engine in hot climates is critical.\nKnowing the grade of oil and combining this with the information in your owner\u2019s manual can help you determine the amount of oil you need \u2014 especially in a specific climate.\n\nWhat Type of Oil should you Choose?\n\nThe type of oil you should select will depend on the viscosity level needed for your engine, which can heavily rely on the climate (which impacts the oil flow). Your owner\u2019s manual can provide additional insight into the type of viscosity you need for your engine.\nAdditionally, you should also take into account the type of oil. You can typically choose from:\n\nConventional \u2013 This is made from refined oil and has a slower flow, making it ideal for lubrication in older engines and cars in colder weather.\nSynthetic \u2013 This type of oil is manufactured and typically includes special additives to aid in the oil\u2019s flow and cleaning abilities. Synthetic oil is usually ideal for cars that engage in activity that stresses the engine and are in areas with extreme temperatures.\nHigh-mileage oil \u2013 For cars over 75,000 miles, high mileage oil is suggested as it can help break apart sludge, slow oil loss, and improve oil efficiency.\n\nIn addition to the climate, type of engine, and needed viscosity, your driving patterns will also help you determine the type of oil you choose. If you use your vehicle for work like towing or find yourself in a lot of start-and-stop traffic, you may want to consider synthetic oil.\nConventional may be the best choice if you have an older engine or a smoother commute. If you\u2019re DIYing your oil changes, check out products like STP Pro Formula Engine Oil Conventional 5W-30 and Mobil 1 Advanced Engine Oil Full Synthetic 5W-30. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to have a plan to recycle your oil once you complete the oil change.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Oil Change Time vs Mileage: When Should You Change Your Oil?",
        "content": "When should you change your oil?\n\nIdeally, you should change your engine oil when the condition begins to deteriorate and can\u2019t protect your engine as well as it used to. You should be able to check your oil to determine:\n\nHow much is remaining in the crankcase\nIf the oil is contaminated by water, making it look like chocolate milk\nIf the oil is breaking down or laden with gritty carbon particles\n\nSometimes, the condition still looks good after several months of use, but it\u2019s still due to be changed. The criteria used to set oil change intervals has changed with more adoption of synthetic and synthetic-blend oils. So, if the condition is fine, the owner\u2019s manual is the best place to check for the correct oil change interval for your specific year, make, model, and engine size.\nAnd what about the oil filter? It captures and stores many of the contaminants that could otherwise wear or damage internal components. For the best protection, it\u2019s highly recommended to replace the engine oil filter during every oil change service. But at the very least, replace the oil filter on every other oil change.\n\nTime based service\n\nDepending on the vehicle, the service interval will have a time-based component. On older vehicles, the interval may state that the oil should be changed every three months, six months, or once per year. If that\u2019s the case, you should not exceed that time frame.\nTime-based services are established because natural degradation occurs in engine oil, and it\u2019s accelerated once exposed to moisture and other contaminants. If you drive your car for only 100 miles with fresh, clean oil in the engine, it will still degrade and oxidize and, eventually, it won\u2019t protect the engine like it should.\n\nMileage based service\n\nLikewise, on most vehicles, there\u2019s a limit to how many miles you can drive before the oil needs to be changed. The average distance used to be 3,000 miles before an oil change was required, but for most modern vehicles, it\u2019s 5,000 miles or more. You should have the oil changed before you reach that mileage limitation.\nWhen engine oil is used, it thickens from exposure to high temperatures and the additives intended to clean and protect inside the engine break down. Some of the oil dissipates as vapor or is consumed by the engine, and the oil level becomes low. Contaminants become suspended in the oil, causing it to look darker Continuing to drive when the oil is dirty or low can create wear inside the engine as well as higher heat than normal and other issues.\n\nOil life monitor\n\nRather than an oil change mileage or time interval, there\u2019s another option. For a majority of vehicles made in the last few years, an oil life monitoring system tracks your usage and predicts when the next service is due. It combines factors including operating conditions, time, and mileage to estimate the best time to change the oil prior to experiencing issues related to poor oil quality.\nOil life monitors, or OLMs, could predict your next oil change in as few miles as 3,000 or at more than 12,000 miles, all relative to how your vehicle is used. It shows up on your dashboard as an oil life percentage, and your service should be performed before it reaches 0% life remaining.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nIf your vehicle has an oil life monitoring system, that\u2019s almost always the best way to track when you\u2019re due. The exception is when you use your vehicle in ways outside of normal operating conditions, like off-roading and towing heavy loads frequently.\nIf your vehicle isn\u2019t equipped with an OLM or you\u2019ve chosen not to use it, how to you pick between oil change time vs mileage?\nYou don\u2019t. An oil change interval gives you two specifications: time AND mileage. On an oil change window sticker or on your instrument cluster\u2019s service reminder, you\u2019ll find the next service is stated as something like \u201c3 months or 5,000 miles\u201d. That means you need to take both figures into consideration. It would be best thought of as \u201c3 months or 5,000 miles, whichever is sooner\u201d.\nRegardless of how you track your oil changes, it\u2019s vital that you have a new engine oil and oil filter installed at least once per year.",

        "title": "What are symptoms of a bad oil pump?",
        "content": "Common Symptoms\n\nThe good news is that you may be able to catch a failing oil pump before it goes completely, especially if you pay attention to these common symptoms of a failing oil pump.\n\nLow Oil Pressure Light\n\nEngines are designed with an oil pressure monitoring system that is designed to monitor the oil pressure of the running engine and warn the driver if the pressure is too low for optimal engine operation.\nYou\u2019ll see an indicator on your dash that looks like an old-timey oil can, usually in red. If this warning light pops up on your dash, you should safely pull over and add some oil to the engine. If the light goes away, then you\u2019ve solved your problem. If it stays, then you should avoid running the engine before checking the oil pump to ensure that it is functioning.\n\nIncreased Engine Temperature\n\nIf oil is lubricating your engine properly it vastly reduces the friction in all the moving parts. Increased friction results in increased heat production, so if your oil pressure is too low, it will cause the engine temperature to increase, and could even lead to overheating. If your engine temperature warning light illuminates on your dash, it could be as a result of a bad oil pump. Some vehicles even have an oil temperature gauge that you can monitor to stay on top of engine temperatures.\n\nNoise from the Valve Train\n\nThe top of your engine contains the valve train, which can include lifters, pushrods, seals, valve guides and other fast-moving components. A lack of lubrication will cause these parts to rub against each other, metal to metal, and that will create ticking or rubbing noises that aren\u2019t normally present on a properly functioning engine. It will also reduce the lifespan of these components drastically.\n\nA Noisy Oil Pump\n\nA good oil pump should be mostly quiet when the vehicle is running, so if you hear unusual whining or whirring sounds coming from the location of the oil pump, you may need to replace it. These sounds are the result of the gears in the pump wearing out.\n\nWhere to find the oil pump\n\nYour oil pump will usually be situated inside the oil pan of the vehicle and your oil pan will be on the underside of the car, where you remove the bolt to drain the oil during oil changes.\nOil pumps are normally driven from the crankshaft or a camshaft but can also be belt or timing chain driven. Accessing the oil pump will involve removing the oil pan and possibly covers on the side of the engine too, depending on the design of your engine. If the pump is driven by the timing chain or belt you will need to be aware of crankshaft location before removing it, so that your engine timing stays true.\n\nTesting oil pump operation\n\nCheck your oil dipstick and add oil if it\u2019s low\nIf you notice any of the symptoms in the article above, you should test to ensure that the oil pump is functioning as intended. The easiest and fastest method of testing is to check your oil dipstick and add oil if it\u2019s low. That may solve your problems on the spot, but if that doesn\u2019t work, you can try the following procedures.\n\nCheck the Oil Pressure Level Sensor on the engine. Your engine should have a sending unit that measures the pressure and sends that information to your vehicle\u2019s computer. Check the wires to make sure there are no breaks or cracks and check the connections for contamination. These sensors can also fail, so it can be good preventative maintenance to replace them every 100,000 miles.\nUse an Oil Pressure Gauge to test the pressure. Start by removing the oil pressure or temperature sending unit, which should be screwed into the block of the engine. Use an oil pressure test kit to measure the oil pressure, consulting with your owner\u2019s manual for the correct RPMs and pressure required for your make and model.\n\nNote that reduced oil pressure can also result from a blocked filter or using the incorrect grade of oil. Regular oil changes, with your vehicle\u2019s recommended oil grade and a new filter every time, will help to prevent some of these issues from occurring in the first place. Check you owner\u2019s manual for the recommended oil change interval for your vehicle.\n\nThe cost to replace the oil pump\n\nThe cost to replace an oil pump can vary extensively. The cost of an oil pump can range from less than $100 to almost $500, but you will also need to replace gaskets that are removed to access the pump.",

        "title": "Explaining the Different Types of Motor Oil and Why it Matter",
        "content": "Types of Motor Oil\n\nConventional Motor Oil\n\nConventional oil is a refined version of base or crude oil. This oil has been cleared of many of its impurities and has additives to reduce sludge, prevent corrosion, and enhance lubrication. It typically has fewer additives than synthetic oil since it is not manufactured, making it less expensive. Conventional oil generally is for drivers who have normal driving patterns.\u202f\u00a0\n\nFull Synthetic Motor Oil\n\nWhile conventional oil is made from crude oil, full synthetic oil is manufactured. It is extensively refined and removes many impurities found in conventional oil. Synthetic motor oil also includes a variety of additives that help improve the oil\u2019s performance to sufficiently clean and lubricate the engine. Synthetic motor oil is ideal for drivers who use their cars in a way that puts stress on the engine. For example, a pickup truck that tows cars or someone who frequently drives on dirt roads may need full synthetic motor oil. Also, because of the process for creating full synthetic motor oil, these types of motor oil are more expensive.\u202f\u00a0\n\nFull Synthetic\n\nBuy Now \n\nSynthetic Blend Motor Oil\n\nSynthetic blend motor oil is a mixture of full synthetic oil and conventional oil. It typically doesn\u2019t have more than 30% of synthetic oil, but it includes additives that allow it to offer additional protection to engines by decreasing the chances of oil evaporation. One of the most beneficial aspects of this oil category is that it\u2019s typically much cheaper than full synthetic oil. You get some of the benefits of synthetic oil without the hefty price.\u202f\u00a0\n\nSynthetic Blend Motor Oil\n\nBuy Now \n\nHigh Mileage Motor Oil\n\nIf you have a vehicle with 75,000 miles or more on the odometer, high mileage motor oil will likely be your best bet. This type of oil has additives that decrease internal and external leaks. The oil does this by causing o-rings and gaskets to inflate, reducing leakage. Additionally, the formula can also reduce sludge in the engine. Conventional, synthetic, and synthetic-blend oils can be formulated to become high mileage motor oil.\u202f\u00a0\n\nHigh Mileage Motor Oil\n\nBuy Now \n\nWhat Type of Oil Should You Use for Your Car?\n\nHow to Choose the Right Oil Type\nDetermining the type of oil your car needs doesn\u2019t have to be a challenging process. Here are some ways to assess the types of motor oil you should use for your car:\u202f\n\nConsult your owner\u2019s manual. \u2013 Your car\u2019s owner manual will recommend oil for your vehicle, so be sure to check it before purchasing.\nCheck to see if it\u2019s been tested. \u2013 Ensure that you select an oil that the American Petroleum Institute has tested. The oil will have a star symbol somewhere on the container to indicate it.\nIs your mileage over 75,000 miles? \u2013 Due to wear and tear on your engine, it\u2019s more likely to leak. In that event, a high-mileage oil \u2014 formulated from conventional, synthetic, or conventional blend \u2014 may be the ideal type of oil for your car.\nWhat\u2019s the weather like in your area? \u2013 If you live in a colder climate, you want to invest in a thinner oil since motor oil thickens in colder climates. Additionally, a thicker oil with more additives may be necessary for a warmer climate since oil thins in warmer weather. Pay attention to the grades, as a lower number in front of the \u201cW\u201d on an oil product means that it is a thicker viscosity.\nWhat is your driving pattern? -\u202f If you frequently drive in start-and-stop traffic or navigate dirt roads, your engine may need more lubrication, meaning that a synthetic oil product could be better. If most of your drives consist of navigating over paved roads and longer uninterrupted drives, the conventional oil or synthetic blend may be your best bet.\n\nAlong with these considerations, you may also want to think about your budget and how you get your oil changed, as you\u2019ll have more options to choose from if you change your oil yourself.\nLastly, if you\u2019re planning to change your oil, know the tools you need and best way to dispose of and recycle your oil.\n\nFrequently Askes Questions",

        "title": "Does Motor Oil Expire? Know When to Change your Oil",
        "content": "Signs It\u2019s Time to Change Your Motor Oil\u00a0\n\nThe oil change reminder is lit\u00a0\nYour car is making a knocking noise\u00a0\nThe oil light comes on\u00a0\nYour car is using more oil than usual\u00a0\nThe Check Engine light is on\u00a0\nYour car\u2019s engine feels sluggish\n\nHow Long Does Motor Oil Last?\u00a0\n\nNothing last forever and motor oil does have an expiry date. However, this date is not an absolute indicator of when you need to replace your oil. The expiry date is simply the point at which the motor oil starts to degrade and lose its effectiveness.\u00a0\nHow long does motor oil last then? On average, conventional motor oil lasts about five years on the shelf in unopened containers. Semi-synthetic and synthetic motor oils will last seven to eight years. However, these are just averages. The actual lifespan of your motor oil will depend on several factors, including how it is stored and the type of oil it is.\u00a0\n\nSynthetic vs Conventional Oil: Which One Lasts Longer?\u00a0\n\nSynthetic vs Conventional Oil\nWhen talking about motor oils, there is no doubt that synthetic oil is superior to conventional oil. Synthetic oil is made from highly refined base oil mixed with a blend of different chemicals and detergents, which makes it more resistant to breakdown and degradation.\u00a0\nConventional motor oil, on the other hand, is made from crude oil that has been refined to a lesser degree. The molecules aren\u2019t as consistent a size as synthetic oil. This means that it is more vulnerable to degradation and will break down faster than synthetic motor oil.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re looking for an oil that will last longer and perform better, synthetic oil is the way to go. However, it is important to note that synthetic oil is more expensive than conventional oil.\u00a0\n\nHow to Tell if Your Engine Oil is Bad?\u00a0\n\nThere are several telltale indications that your engine oil may be bad. This subject can be broken up into two sections: used and unused motor oil.\u00a0\n\nUsed Engine Oil\u00a0\n\nUsed engine oil refers to motor oil that has been used in an engine. The biggest indicator that your used motor oil is bad is the color. Fresh, new oil is usually a light amber color. As it breaks down, it will start to turn dark brown or black.\u00a0\nAnother indication that your used motor oil is bad is the texture. If your oil feels gritty or thick, it has most likely started to break down. Of course, one of the biggest indicators used to tell if engine oil is bad comes down to the number of miles it has been used.\u00a0\n\nUnused Engine Oil\u00a0\n\nUnused engine oil refers to motor oil that has not been used in an engine. The biggest indicator that your unused motor oil is bad is the expiry date. Unused motor oil will start to degrade and lose its effectiveness after a certain amount of time.\u00a0\nMost engine oils will have an expiry date printed on the bottle. However, if there is no expiry date, you can generally the production date on the jug and tack on an additional five years to that.\u00a0\nSo, does motor oil expire? The answer is a definite yes. However, the expiry date is not an absolute indicator of when you need to replace your oil. The expiry date is simply the point at which the motor oil loses its lubrication properties. When in doubt, swap it out.\u00a0\n\nWhen Should You Change Your Oil?\u00a0\n\nWhen should you change your oil?\n\nTo check your oil level, simply remove the dipstick from the engine and wipe it clean with a rag and re-insert all the way in before pulling it out again. The oil level should be somewhere between the \u201cfull\u201d and \u201cadd\u201d marks on the dipstick.\u00a0\nOn newer models, the oil level can be checked via the infotainment system, eliminating the need to get your hands dirty. If you\u2019re unsure about when to change your oil, it\u2019s always best to consult your owner\u2019s manual or a professional mechanic.\u00a0\n\nFinal Words\u00a0\n\nAt the end of the day, does motor oil go bad? The answer is yes. No matter if it\u2019s tucked away in your garage or being put to work protecting vital components in your car\u2019s engine, always make sure it is used within the \u201cbest before\u201d date.\u00a0\nGet the right motor oil for your car with AutoZone and ensure that your engine is properly protected.

        "title": "Which Tools Do I Need to Change My Oil?",
        "content": "General Shop Tools Everyone Needs\n\nThis first group of tools are pieces that everyone needs to get started on working with their vehicles. From this group of tools, you could do an oil change on most cars with only a ratchet and socket set, a funnel, oil capture container, and a jack and jack stands.\nRatchet and Socket Set\n\nA ratchet massively reduces the time it takes to remove a fastener because you don\u2019t have to remove the tool from the bolt every time you make a turn, like you do with a combination wrench. Get a set that includes some metric and SAE sizes, and if you\u2019re starting out, a 3/8\u201d drive should do just fine. Ratchets and sockets also come in 1/4, 1/2\u2033, 3/4\u2033, and 1\u201d drives. Many medium sized kits will include ratchets and sockets in 3/8\u201d and 1/2\u2033 drive.\u00a0\nWrenches\n\nYour car is fastened together using a few thousand nuts and bolts and the simplest way to loosen them is with a wrench. Wrenches come in SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) sizes and metric sizes. Some people will refer to SAE as \u201cstandard\u201d. Most vehicles built today use metric sizes because of the globalization of the auto industry, but there are still some domestic manufacturers that rely heavily on SAE sizes. Even those domestic automakers will have parts with metric nuts and bolts on them, though.\u00a0\nFor this reason, start with a full set of metric combination wrenches and purchase an SAE set if your car requires it. A small set of wrenches can cost as little as $20-$30, with larger or professional sets that can move into the range of several hundred dollars. Don\u2019t feel like you need a professional set to start out, though.\nScrewdriver Set\n\nIf you own a car, house, or even a bike, you need a set of screwdrivers. The good thing is that multi-screwdriver sets can be inexpensive, starting around $10 for a basic set. Make sure to get a set that has a variety of Phillips and straight-slot drivers, plus Robertson and even some Torx heads.\nMaintenance Ramps\n\nOlder maintenance ramps were made of steel, but modern versions are typically made out of a high-density plastic. You simply drive up the ramp and place a chock behind the wheels that are still on the ground. This elevates part of the car that is on the ramps and allows you to access the undercarriage of the vehicle to do work. The advantage to ramps is that they are very quick \u2013 you just place them in front of the wheels, drive up, and chock the other wheels to prevent the car from rolling backwards. The disadvantage is that you can\u2019t take off the tires when using ramps, so it reduces the number of repairs that you can do. Our next tools, though, solve that problem.\nHydraulic Floor Jack and Jack Stands\n\nA floor jack has a long handle that makes pumping up the hydraulic cylinder very easy. The advantage of the floor jack is that it provides access to the wheels, so that you can switch tires, replace brake pads and rotors, work on the suspension and steering, or just complete routine visual inspections of your vehicle. Always use a set of jack stands to support the vehicle when you work under it because a hydraulic jack can fail. If you have to choose between ramps or a jack and jack stands, the latter will be the more versatile option.\u00a0\nSafety Glasses\n\nSafety glasses are a must for any work that you do around a vehicle. You only get one set of eyes, so you need to protect them.\nA Set of Rags for Cleanup\n\nYour old gym t-shirt is perfect for wiping your hands and cleaning up small spills, but a roll of shop towels is also a great addition to the garage.\n\nSpecific Oil Change Tools\n\nThese tools will help to make your oil change experience efficient and fast.\n\nOil Filter Socket, Wrench or Pliers\n\nFunnel\n\nYou\u2019ll need a funnel to avoid spilling any oil as you refill the oil capacity through the oil filler cap.\n\nOil Capture Drain Container\n\nWhen you drain your oil from the oil pan you will need to capture it in a container before transferring it to the used oil cans and taking it to your local oil recycler. Purpose built oil drain containers have a handy spout to make the transfer quick and easy.\n\nNitrile Gloves\n\nDisposable nitrile gloves aren\u2019t a must-have item, but they make the process less grimy, and they protect your hands from being covered in motor oil, which is a carcinogen.\u00a0\nCreeper\n\nA creeper is a trolley that you lie on to wheel around under your vehicle. It isn\u2019t essential, but it makes working under your vehicle easier and safer.\nGet Out There and Do It\n\nWorking on your own vehicle develops a sense of pride in your ride and in yourself. Don\u2019t wait to begin building your own set of tools, starting with the basics. When you need tools for your DIY projects, you\u2019ll find them at AutoZone along with Trustworthy Advice.",

        "title": "Why is My Oil Change Light On?",
        "content": "Understanding Oil Pressure\n\nThe job of the engine\u2019s oil pump is to pump oil from the oil pan into all the passages of the engine, lubricating bearings and metal-on-metal components with motor oil. To do this, some of these tolerances are extremely tight and require the oil to travel under a good deal of pressure to properly lubricate. \nSome engine oil pressure gauges will remain steady in the operational range while others will\u00a0actually fluctuate\u00a0depending on engine RPM. That said, most normal engine oil pressures at operating temperature are somewhere between 25-40PSI. Some gauges today don\u2019t have pressure values on them, but simply have an \u201cideal zone\u201d that\u2019s indicated on the gauge. What\u2019s important here is to simply understand that ideal point that your engine operates\u00a0at, and\u00a0take note of anything out of the ordinary.\nGauges are commonly designed to show the desired PSI at the top of the reading range\u00a0or with a shaded ideal area\u00a0for easier recognition in case of a problem. Many vehicles\u00a0though\u00a0still don\u2019t have a gauge, and simply have a light indicating there\u2019s a problem. It is possibly the most important warning instrument on the dashboard as it effectively measures the vehicle\u2019s operating pressure in real time, much like blood pressure monitors function for the human body.\nIf your oil pressure drops drastically or is consistently very low, immediate attention is usually needed. Older, high-milage engines will generally operate at lower oil pressure just from older, worn components and the engine entering the end of its life cycle, but no oil pressure at all means the vehicle should be shut down immediately and examined on whether you have a gauge issue (which can happen) or an actual pressure issue.\n\nThe Difference Between Gauges and Warning Lights\n\nIt is important to understand the different functions of\u00a0oil\u00a0indicators and oil gauges. The oil pressure gauge provides a constant reading that shows the actual oil pressure\u00a0or range\u00a0at any given time while the engine is running. The oil light, or oil pressure light that typically looks like a bright red light that says \u201cOIL\u201d only comes on when there has been a drastic drop in oil pressure or low oil level to a point that needs immediate attention, and it is essential to respond quickly if the light does happen to come on.\nWhile there are times that the sending unit that triggers this light could just malfunction, there could also be a problem with oil level or oil pressure. Whether the sensors are malfunctioning or there\u2019s legitimately an issue with the oil and the engine, they always mean you need to have someone\u00a0take a look\u00a0immediately. Driving with the wrong amount of oil, or with oil pressure that is too high or low can seriously damage your engine, leading to costly repairs. If you are driving and an oil light comes on, get off the road as soon as you possibly can, and shut off the engine. We\u2019ll talk more about this in a minute.\n\nWhat Does the Oil Change Light Mean?\n\nWhat Does Low Oil Pressure Mean?\n\nThere are instances where the oil pressure reading cab reach an undesirable range with\u00a0or without\u00a0any flashing or red illumination from the dashboard.\u00a0Any reading below\u00a010 PSI is a sure sign of an internal problem, so is a reading over\u00a070\u00a0PSI.\u00a0Low oil pressure is\u00a0generally a\u00a0sign of a worn engine with worn bearings, oil pump, or a partially blocked oil pick up in the pan.\u00a0Neglecting oil changes to a serious degree can\u00a0also\u00a0cause massive pressure issues. A no-oil pressure situation is\u00a0generally a\u00a0failed oil pump, but could also be\u00a0a number of\u00a0other issues, and will need to be checked out carefully.\nWhatever the case, any time a low oil pressure or no-pressure is\u00a0indicated, you should\u00a0immediately\u00a0pull the vehicle into a safe location\u00a0and shut down. Driving\u00a0on\u00a0no oil pressure will only last a few more minutes, and\u00a0you\u2019ll\u00a0be replacing a seized engine.\nOnce pulled over\u00a0and shut down, check your oil level first. Look under the vehicle for any leaking oil. Ruptured oil filters are rare, but they can happen, and are especially suspect\u00a0immediately\u00a0after an oil change.\u00a0Any major leaks in the oil system (filter, oil cooler) will\u00a0immediately\u00a0be\u00a0apparent\u00a0from a visible oil leak\u00a0that\u2019s\u00a0large. If all of these check out, the issue could be internal, and the gauge/light\u00a0will need to be ruled out versus an actual internal engine problem. Although oil pressure issues are\u00a0generally rare,\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0important to know how to react to them\u00a0and treat every one of them with extreme caution.",

        "title": "Why is My Car Burning Oil?",
        "content": "What Causes Oil Burning?\n\u00a0An engine is designed so that oil\u00a0is circulated to lubricate\u00a0all the moving parts of the engine, but not\u00a0enter into\u00a0the combustion chamber area and be burned. Naturally, a very small amount of oil can and will be present in the chamber, but in a normally operating engine, this amount is so minute\u00a0that it is not\u00a0noticeable. There are several key parts on an engine that can fail and cause oil consumption, which are listed below.\n\n1. Blocked Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV)\n\nWhen an engine operates, the \u201ccrankcase\u201d portion of the engine (the oil pan, crankshaft, bottom of pistons, and oil galley leading up to the valve covers) becomes pressurized by blow-by from the pistons. To relieve this pressure, a crankcase ventilation system recirculates this air/oil vapor pressure into the intake tract as a one-way valve. If this system clogs, the blow-by sits in the crankcase and builds pressure, which can blow out gaskets, or force oil past the valves and into the combustion chamber. \nMost cars historically have used a replicable PCV valve in this system, which should be changed every few oil changes in an interval, as they are inexpensive and easy to replace. Many manufacturers today have made this system more complicated and have a larger crankcase valve, some of which can even be electric. Many of these valves suffer clogs from oil vapor, and eventually completely block the system, leading to oil consumption.\n\n2. Damaged Valve Seals or Guides\n\nValve seals serve one purpose \u2013 to keep oil that is flowing around the valves from leaking down into the combustion chamber. Valve guides also keep the valve\u2019s path perfectly straight and square as they open and close.\nOnce a valve seal wears out, oil can leak past the seal. If the valve guides are also worn, this leak can be even worse. As this oil leaks down into the valves, it burns off. When valve seals degrade, oil that pools in the cylinder head after shut-down also can also leak down into the combustion chamber slowly.\nThis is evident on startup of the vehicle by a puff of blue smoke being emitted only at start up, as this oil that slowly leaked into the combustion chamber is suddenly burned off.\n\n3. Broken or Worn Piston Rings\n\nPiston rings do 2 things. For one, the compression rings allow for the piston to properly compress the air/fuel mixture without any leaks or blow-by. Second, the oil control rings scrape the lubricating oil from the cylinder walls so that no oil enters the combustion chamber.\nAs these rings wear, 2 things can happen. As compression rings deteriorate, blow-by gasses can escape, enter the crankcase, gather oil vapor, and be pushed into the intake tract via the PCV system. Secondly, and more commonly, the oil control rings can wear or become gunked up with carbon, leaving oil on the cylinder walls and combustion chamber, which is then burned. Worse yet, a ring can fracture or break, leading to an even bigger leak.\n\n4. Oil Entering the Turbocharger\n\nWhile this only applies to turbocharged vehicles, it is a frequent problem. Turbochargers use oil to lubricate the turbine bearings inside the unit. Seals are also in place to keep this oil from leaking past the bearings and either into the cold side of the turbo (the compressor side leading to the intake) or the hot side (the exhaust side leading to the rest of the exhaust system). Either leak will result in burned oil. Usually once the oil seal goes, the bearing follows, resulting in complete turbo failure.\n\nOil Burning Outside the Engine\n\nIf your engine\u00a0isn\u2019t burning oil internally, there is a chance that oil could be burning externally. This happens when oil leaks down onto the exhaust manifold, turbo, or exhaust system.\n\n1. Leaking Valve Cover Gasket\n\nFor oil to leak and immediately be burned, it usually must start somewhere high up in the engine. One of the prime locations is a valve cover gasket that slowly seeps oil onto the exhaust manifold. In this case, you may never see an actual leak underneath as all of this oil is being vaporized by the hot exhaust manifold.\n\n2. Broken PCV Tract\n\nWe talked before about the PCV system. This system is usually composed of several pipes or hoses that can also leak, and drip / force oil vapor down onto the exhaust.\n\n3. Damaged Turbo Oil Line\n\nMost turbo oil lines are either steel or braided stainless hoses. They can fail, leading to an oil leak directly onto the hot turbo or exhaust manifold.\n\n4. Loose Oil Filler Cap\n\nhe oil filler cap is the cover to the opening through which you fill the engine. If the cap is missing, loose, or worn out, the engine oil might flow onto the surface of the engine and burn.\n\nHow Can You Fix a Car That is Burning Oil?\n\nIf you have an issue with a car burning oil,\u00a0the most important thing is to check your oil\u00a0often and\u00a0carry extra oil. While it\u2019s not a good idea to continue to operate your vehicle consuming oil, sometimes\u00a0it\u2019s also difficult to correctly diagnose where it\u2019s coming from.\nThe first order of repair is diagnosing exactly\u00a0the cause of the oil consumption. For this, if you need a mechanic to help, search through our\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0in your area to help you identify someone who can help diagnose what\u2019s going on.\nThe cost of repairs will depend on the cause of the leak. A clogged PCV system could be as simple as a\u00a0$10.00 replacement PCV valve. Worn piston rings will involve an entire engine overhaul or replacement, which will be thousands of dollars.",

        "title": "Oil Viscosity Explained: 5w20 vs. 5w30 vs. 10w30",
        "content": "Oil Viscosity Explained\n\nDifferent Types of Motor Oil\n\nThe term \u201cviscosity\u201d refers to the thickness of the oil and its resistance to flow. A higher oil viscosity number indicates a thicker oil. Where this is vitally important is in an engine\u2019s bearing clearances. Older engines were built with much looser tolerances, which allowed oils such as 10W30 to be commonplace as an OE recommended oil in the 1990\u2019s and before. More recent engines have been built with better technology, and much more strict tolerances, which also means a much thinner oil is necessary to properly lube the engine\u2019s bearings, and circulate quicker and freer throughout the engine, and often times with less overall oil in the system. A thinner oil reaches the engine parts quicker, and circulates faster, while a thicker oil tends to adhere more easily to the engine parts, and will provide better lubrication when engine tolerances have deteriorated, or in severe-duty applications like racing or off-road engines. Viscosity will determine how your engine\u2019s oil will deal with changes in temperature, pressure, and speed. What\u2019s vitally important, is that you stick with what the manufacturer recommends for oil viscosity.\n\nWhat Do Oil Viscosity Numbers Mean?\n\nThe five and 10 digits refer to the viscosity at cooler temperatures. So, that means when you are comparing 5w30 vs. 10w30, the thinner 5w30 will circulate quicker, and flow through bearing tolerances better during an engine startup in the winter or colder climates. The \u201cw\u201d behind the five and the 10 indicates that those are the viscosities in colder or winter temperatures. The viscosity of the winter number is tested at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The 30 refers to the viscosity at higher temperatures. This indicates that the oil is thicker at higher temperatures, so it adheres to the metal parts of the engine, protecting them as they operate. This number is tested at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The viscosity number is the result of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) determining how fast the oil will flow through a certain size tube.\nWhen comparing 5w20 vs. 5w30 motor oil, the 20 indicates that the oil has a lower viscosity and is thinner at higher temperatures. This enables the 5w20 motor oil to reach engine parts quicker and create less drag that reduces fuel economy. So, due to viscosity, 5w20 is a thinner oil during operating temperatures, whereas 5w30 is thicker during operating temperatures. A majority of manufacturers are now producing engines that operate on 5w20 oil, to which it\u2019s important to stick to this viscosity and not substitute 5w30.\n\nWhy Do Some Oils Only Have One Number? \n\nOriginally, oils were only produced in a single grade, such as SAE 30. At that time, oils had to be changed seasonally using a higher oil viscosity in the summer and a lower viscosity in the winter. Then, thickening agents were developed and multigrade oil became available. \n\nWhich Viscosity Is Best? \n\nUsing the motor oil recommended in your owner\u2019s manual is the best way to protect your engine, have it operate efficiently, and get good mileage. However, many owner\u2019s manuals could provide a range of oils. So, since the difference between 5w20, 5w30, and 10w30 is the temperature at which they work best, the answer depends on where you live and what the climate is. If your car\u2019s manual suggests a specific weight, as most cars built in the last 20 years will \u2013 stick with it.\n\nUsing a Higher Oil Viscosity in High-Mileage Cars\n\nLike mentioned before, in the past, engines were built with looser tolerances \u2013 especially bearing clearances. An engine\u2019s life began to deteriorate rather rapidly around 100,000 miles, and so to increase the oil pressure, high-mileage car owners would use a higher oil viscosity such as 10w40 or 20w50. It\u2019s important to note, that your engine\u2019s oil pump, and thus the engine, has to work extremely hard to pump thicker oil and maintain oil pressure, so folks that would resort to 20w50 oil on their tired, old engine would also sacrifice horsepower using it. Fast forward to today\u2019s engines, and it\u2019s not uncommon to see engines on the road with 300-400,000 miles on them. Many circulation and oiling issues of the past have been solved, along with tighter tolerances, so switching to extreme weights of oil is not always necessary, and could actually cause your engine to perform worse. If you notice the motor burning or leaking oil, you can use a high-mileage motor oil rather than a higher viscosity. High-mileage motor oils have additives that restore seals. \n\nFinal Words\n\nTo recap, a lower oil viscosity number indicates a thinner oil that will flow faster, while higher oil viscosity number indicates a thicker oil which often works better in extreme applications. For engines that do not have a recommended weight \u2013 winter and colder temperatures, you should use a lower viscosity oil for cold start up. For warmer temperatures, you should use a higher viscosity oil.\nIn addition, motor oil not only lubricates engine parts, but it also cleans acids and silicon oxide from engine parts. These waste materials remain in the motor oil until you change your oil. So, it is important that you change your motor oil and oil filter regularly as recommended by your owner\u2019s manual.",

        "title": "Car Leaking Oil? How to Fix Engine Oil Leaks at Home",
        "content": "First, What Causes Oil Leaks?\n\nTo find out how your car is leaking oil, you have to figure out what caused the leak in the first place. There is no use in fixing a problem only to have it occur again. An oil leak can be caused by one of four problems. The most common cause of an oil leak is due to a degraded engine gasket. An engine gasket is a seal that ensures that lubricants do not leak. When there is a break in the gasket, you will begin to lose vehicle fluids. In most cases, you will leak motor oil. The other less common causes of oil leaks are an oil pan leak, oil seals, or bad connections. In order to find out what is causing the leak, you will want to inspect these four areas. \n\nInspecting Your Vehicle for the Cause of the Leak\n\nNow that you know the possible sources of your car leaking oil, it is time to crawl under the car and find out what is causing the problem. First, you will want to check the oil pan seals. Also, you will want to check the oil pan plug. After you check the oil pan, go ahead and take a look at the timing cover seal and the valve cover gaskets. Other places to look for a possible leak include the oil pressure sensor, the oil filter, and the oil cap. If you have an older vehicle with lots of worn parts, then it\u2019s possible that you may have multiple oil leaks.\n\nNow It\u2019s Time to Fix That Oil Leak\n\nAfter you have done your inspection, it\u2019s time to roll up your sleeves and learn how to fix an oil leak. You don\u2019t have to read a whole book to learn how to fix that leak. While there are some oil leaks that can only be fixed by expensive repairs, most can be done in your garage or driveway rather inexpensively. The only thing you will need is a car jack, jack stands, torque wrench, and some special additives or replacement parts (something like a new oil pan). Here are the two main approaches that you can take to fix your oil leak.\n\nUsing an Additive to Stop the Leak\n\nOne of the easiest ways to fix the leak yourself is to use a stop leak additive or high mileage oil blend. Such products can soften and condition your car\u2019s rubber seals to stop and prevent further automotive leaks. It may take up to a few hundred miles of driving before the leak is completely sealed. Next, you\u2019ll learn how to deal with an oil pan leak and other oil leak situations. You should generally try to fix the leak by replacing components before resorting to using stop leak.\n\nFixing the Problem with Tools\n\nDon\u2019t worry. Fixing an oil pan leak and other situations with tools is not as hard as you would think. All you need are some hand tools, a torque wrench, and a car jack and stands or some ramps. First, safely jack up the car so you can safely access the oil pan. Now, check for loose bolts on the oil pan. Over time, these bolts can loosen, and loose bolts leak. After tightening all the bolts on the oil pan, move over to the timing belt cover and the valve covers. Be aware that specific car models require you to tighten bolts in a certain pattern to a specific tolerance level. Check a service manual or repair guide for more information.\n\nAfter You Have Fixed the Leak, It\u2019s Time to Test\n\nOnce you believe you have fixed the problem, it is time to test everything out. Get about a quart of oil and top off your oil level. Afterward, you will want to turn on the engine with the hood up. Check the top of the engine while the car is running. Sometimes, you may find out that the oil is leaking from the gasket or the oil cap, and the engine will start to smoke because it is burning oil. It\u2019s important to know what causes oil leaks from all parts of your vehicle.\nAfter running the car for a couple of minutes, move the vehicle about 5 feet from where it was previously parked. Check to see if any oil leaks have accumulated on the driveway. If you still see an oil puddle, then you have to go back and recheck the tightening of your bolts.\n\nBottom Line\n\nOil leaks are one of the common and frustrating car problems that can occur. Before you take the vehicle to the garage for a hefty repair bill, learn how to fix an oil leak yourself. Remember to check everything from the oil pan to the gaskets and the oil cap. Be sure to double-check and make sure that you fixed the leak after the repair. With a little know-how and more patience, you will be able to handle any oil leak problem on your vehicle.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How to Remove Oil Stains from Concrete",
        "content": "Why You Should Remove Stains\n\nIt can sometimes be tempting to simply leave oil stains alone, especially if they are on your garage floor or another area that most people will never take too close of a look at. While it can take a bit of work to remove oil stains, it can be a worthwhile task. If left alone, oil can be damaging to your concrete, breaking down the sealant or finish on the top layer and causing your concrete to eventually break down sooner than it otherwise would\u2019ve. While sometimes it isn\u2019t convenient to clean up oil stains immediately, it can be better on your concrete as well as being easier on you to get to start treating them as soon as you can.\n\nHow to Remove Oil Stains from Concrete\n\n1. Removing Stains with Soap\n\nWhile it may take a little more than your average soapy sponge, certain soaps can actually be highly effective at getting oil stains out of concrete floors and other areas. Removing oil stains from concrete with soap can require concentrated amounts. Most soaps are commonly used in a diluted form for most day to day tasks, but you\u2019ll likely need something stronger for tough oil stains, especially if they\u2019ve been left to soak in the concrete for a while. As with most cleaning tasks, you should expect to put a fair amount of elbow grease into the oil removal process. To start out, you should try and soak up as much of the spilled oil as you can by laying out rags or paper towels on the area. Once you\u2019ve soaked up as much as you can, you should pour the concentrated soap on the area and start scrubbing with a stiff brush. After scrubbing, rinse the area with water to finish the process.\n\n2. Removing Stains with Litter\n\nA tried and true method for oil removal can be to use cat litter. Cat litter is super absorbent and can be a great substance to use to soak up messy stains. An inexpensive way to get rid of stains, this method can be simple to do, but it may take several tries and some work on your part to get all of the oil completely out. To start getting oil up out of your concrete with cat litter, simply pour some of it over the stain and work it into the area by stepping on it or mashing it down another way. Leave the litter alone for at least an hour before sweeping or vacuuming it away. If some oil still remains you can repeat the process as many times as needed.\nA variation on using cat litter to clean up oil that may be more effective in some cases can be done by creating a poultice from the cat litter and a substance that will work as a thinning agent, such as paint thinner and applying it to the stain. You should then cover the stain with plastic wrap or something similar and leave it to sit for at least several hours. The mixture should eventually leech the oil right out the concrete, cleaning up the mess and leaving you with just some sweeping to do to finish cleaning up. If you don\u2019t want to use cat litter, sawdust can be a good substitute that should give you similar results.\n\n3. Other Ways to Remove Stains\n\nOne of the most effective ways to remove oil stains is to use a dedicated oil absorbent, which can be made of small pebbles like kitty litter or in the form of a liner. These products will come with instructions on how to use them. If you follow the instructions with one of these products, you\u2019ll be using a compound specially formulated for absorbing oil.\nEven if you don\u2019t think either of the methods listed above will work for you, there are still ways you can get rid of oil stains. Another way to remove oil from concrete can be with oil-eating microorganisms. It may sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but you can actually buy oil removers that use single-celled organisms to consume the oil, leaving behind a residue that can easily be wiped up once the oil is eaten away.\nThere are also other products you can use, such as detergents and degreasers. There should be a wide variety of brands with different strengths available. While products made to remove oil stains may require a special trip to the store or online order to acquire, they can be a great solution to try, especially if other measures haven\u2019t been working for you.\n\nPreventing\u00a0Future Stains\n\nWhen it comes to oil stains, prevention can be the best policy and can save you lots of hassle by removing the need for you to clean up stains in the first place. While you may already have to deal with some existing stains, you can still work to prevent more from occurring during future maintenance activities that involve oil. One of the easiest ways to do this can be to save cardboard boxes so that you can lay sheets of cardboard under your work area to soak up any oil that may spill.\n\nCleaning Up\u00a0Oil\n\nAs you start thinking about how to get oil stains off your driveway, it can be a good idea to keep in mind that even if one method doesn\u2019t work, another one may be effective and it can be worth it to keep trying. When left untreated, oil can eventually lead to problems with your concrete that could end up being expensive, but by cleaning up oil as soon as you can you can prevent this from happening. Making oil clean up a part of your\u00a0regular maintenance routine\u00a0can be a great way to make sure it gets done. There are a lot of products available that can make the job easier and you should be able to find a method that works great for you.

        "title": "How to Use Oil Stabilizer",
        "content": "How Does Oil Stabilizer\u00a0Work?\n\nThere are a few different companies that make stabilizers, and each one has a unique formula with a slightly different method of action, so it\u2019s difficult to explain a step-by-step mechanism that applies to all of them, but the idea behind all of them is the same. By adding a stabilizer, you help to more thoroughly\u00a0coat and lubricate the engine components, extending the life of the oil. While your vehicle and oil both have recommendations about how often to change them, there is no actual way to tell exactly how much use you will get out of oil. It needs to be changed because the high temperatures and other stresses placed on the fluid in its use as a lubricant causes it to change chemically over time, and impurities also enter the oil as it ages and cycles through the engine more and more. The guidelines are meant to indicate when, on average, you can expect the viscosity to fall enough that the oil no longer protects as well as it should.\nBy helping to protect engine parts and stabilizing the oil with an additive that helps keep it from losing viscosity as quickly, you can get more out of each oil change before it\u2019s time to go through your\u00a0maintenance cycle\u00a0again. For drivers who rack up the miles, this can be an important part of keeping your vehicle maintained economically. When paired with engine system cleaners that minimize build-up so impurities do not have as much opportunity to work their way into the oil, the result is better support for your engine oil\u2019s core function.\n\nIs Oil Stabilizer\u00a0Necessary?\n\nIf your vehicle needed it, the manual would say so. Like many other aftermarket vehicle treatments and parts, oil stabilizers are designed to give you an edge in performance above and beyond the original manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Oil stabilizer works best when it is used consistently, so you may not see the same level of improvement with inconsistent use as you would if it were being added every oil change. The directions also tell you to use it in every oil change once you start.\n\nWhen To\u00a0Start Adding Oil Stabilizer\n\nMany car owners wonder if they have to wait until their vehicle is old enough to be considered a\u00a0high mileage\u00a0automobile before it\u2019s safe to use additives like this. The fact is, you can use oil stabilizers once your engine is through its initial breaking-in phase. In fact, the earlier you start using stabilizers and other performance products, the more they can do to reduce wear and tear on your vehicle, extending its useful life.\n\nHow to\u00a0Use Oil Stabilizer\n\nThe formulation in Lucas\u2019s stabilizer is designed so it doesn\u2019t void new vehicle warnings when it is used in every oil change, so consistency is important if your vehicle is still under warranty. Stabilizer can be used as follows:\n\nIn newer vehicles and those with basic engine wear, use one quart stabilizer in each oil change, or 20% of the total volume\nUse in every oil change\nUse the synthetic blend for light weights like 5w30\nYou may choose to top off the engine with stabilizer instead of oil between changes as well, to lengthen engine life in older vehicles\n\nLucas\u2019s official instructions also note that you can use the stabilizer in greater quantities than directed for new vehicles if necessary. Specifically, it is safe to use up to 60% stabilizer in vehicles with significant engine wear. This will vary for different brands. If you are not sure about increasing oil stabilizer use, it\u2019s worth talking to an experienced technician about the state of your vehicle\u2019s engine, to get recommendations about appropriate use for its level of wear.\n\nAdditional\u00a0Uses for Oil Stabilizer\n\nWhile there are separate treatments for issues like seal leaks in the power steering fluid, Lucas does recommend the use of its regular oil stabilizer in a few additional applications. This is possible because the oils used as fluids in those systems are close enough in composition and viscosity to benefit from the stabilizer. Do not use it with any system fluids other than oil and lubricants.\n\nLucas notes the stabilizer works with any petroleum-based or synthetic oil\nUse it in a 25/75 ratio with 25% stabilizer and 75% transmission fluid to improve manual transmission function\nUse in a 50/50 ratio when adding to the differential\n\nWhat are the\u00a0Benefits of Oil Stabilizer?\n\nAccording to Lucas, the oil stabilizer will not only prolong the life of an engine, it will also provide you with approximately 50% more\u00a0time between oil changes. Remember to check your oil regularly, because if your engine has issues that make the oil life unexpectedly shorter than advertised, that means you may need maintenance to fix worn parts or malfunctions. There are a few reasons why engine oil would break down early, and while a stabilizer will slow down the issue, it will not fix it on its own.\n\nRunning too hot can change oil viscosity more quickly than recommended or burn off oil\nLots of engine wear and impurity buildup can lead to contaminants that reduce the lubricant quality in the oil and possibly lead to earlier viscosity changes\nLeaks will not be stopped with a stabilizer, there are other strategies for stopping them, including sealant stop-leak products\nCompromised oil systems can also bring in foreign matter, leading to engine issues",

        "title": "How and When To Check Your Oil",
        "content": "How Do I Check My Oil?\n\nEven if you\u2019ve never done it before, checking your oil\u202fis rather easy. Your car\u2019s engine will be equipped with a dipstick that accurately measures the amount of oil in the oil pan.\n\nHow to Check Your Oil Level\n\n1. Park Your Car\n\nAlways park your car on level ground before checking your oil to ensure an accurate, easy read. Make sure you give your car about 1-2 minutes for the oil to settle back into the pan. While the engine is operating, a portion of the oil inside the oil pan is being circulated throughout the engine. This gives the oil time to settle and drain back into the pan.\n\n2. Check at the Right Temperature\n\nFor the most part, it\u2019s recommended that you also check your oil when your engine is cool to avoid dealing with a hot engine. However, some manufacturers recommend checking certain vehicles when the oil and engine are warm instead. Consult your owner\u2019s manual to find out for sure which is best for your vehicle.\n\n3. Make Sure Your Car is Not On\n\nWhether you do a warm or cool check, make sure your engine is\u202foff.\n\n4. Pull the Dipstick and Clean It\n\nLocate your engine\u2019s dipstick and pull it out. Gently and thoroughly wipe off any oil with a clean, soft cloth or paper towel.\n\n5. Reinsert the Dipstick\n\nPut the dipstick back into its compartment and push it all the way down. Some dipsticks need to go back in the exact way they came out, so be sure to check this.\n\n6. Remove the Dipstick Again\n\nPull it out again and make a note of how much of the stick is coated with oil. Although not all dipsticks are identical, every single one\u202fwill\u202fhave some clear way of indicating where your oil level currently is versus where it should be (e.g. low and high, L and H, or MIN and MAX).\n\nIf your oil levels are within recommended limits, then you\u2019re good to go for now. Just make sure to keep checking back in the future. If your dipstick indicates that your levels are low, you\u2019ll need to add more oil.\nIf things don\u2019t look right (ie, nothing on the stick or way too much oil) when inspecting the dipstick, double check by re-inserting and removing again. Make sure the dipstick is completely seated in the tube and is put back in the proper way. If your second reading reveals the same thing, you will then need to react by adding oil or removing if over-full.\nWhen you check your oil levels, it\u2019s also important to check the\u202fcondition\u202fof your oil, as it can tell you a lot about how your engine\u2019s been running. Normal, healthy used motor oil is typically either black or brown and free of any visible pieces of debris. If you do\u202fsee bits of debris in the oil, especially if they look like they might be made of metal, there\u2019s a chance your engine has internal damage, or your oil filter has gone into complete bypass. Alternatively, your oil may appear cloudy, milky, or murky, which can mean you\u2019re dealing with a coolant leak, like a blown head gasket.\nIn either case, it\u2019s time to get your car to your favorite mechanic shop for further evaluation, or it\u2019s time to dig in for some DIY diagnosing. However, if you do suspect a coolant leak, it\u2019s important not to drive\u202fyour car. You should have your car towed instead, as it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.\n\nHow Do I\u00a0Add Oil to My Engine?\n\nRemove the cap to your oil tank. (In most cases, it will be located somewhere at the top of your engine.)\nCarefully start adding your oil, preferably using a funnel to keep spills and drips to a minimum. It\u2019s also important not to overfill\u202fyour tank, as this can cause issues with your engine. Add oil in half quart increments at a time to prevent this.\nAfter each half quart, give the oil a moment to settle into the tank. Then use your dipstick to retest the levels. Repeat this process until your oil levels are within recommended limits.\nWhen finished, screw the oil tank cap back into place.\n\nIn most cases, a quart is going to be the most you\u2019ll need to add in order to get your oil levels back to where they should be. Every so often though, especially if it\u2019s been awhile since your last check, a second quart could be needed. If you find you need to add extra oil to your engine on a regular basis, you may want to have your vehicle checked to make sure it isn\u2019t either leaking oil or burning it up.\nIt is vitally important that you do not overfill your engine with oil. An over-filled oil pan will result in the crankshaft striking and sloshing in the oil, which will cause cavitation and air bubbles in the oil. This is equally as bad as an engine running low on oil, so resist the temptation to over-fill an engine that is consistently using or leaking oil.\n\nHow Often Should I\u00a0Check My Oil Levels?\n\nKnowing\u202fwhen to check oil\u202fis just as important as knowing how, as consistency is the key to good\u00a0automotive maintenance. Back in the day, full-service gas stations always checked oil during gas fill up. Today, it\u2019s a great habit to check your oil every 3-4 fill-ups or every 1000 miles. Or, another benchmark would be to get into the habit of checking your vehicle\u2019s oil levels once a month or so. (Checking once every couple of weeks is even better.) If your car is older or has a history of using oil between changes, it\u2019s not a bad idea to check your oil even more often than that. You should also routinely check before taking long drives or going on long road trips of any type just to make sure your oil levels are where they need to be. The last thing you want is to wind up stranded in the middle of nowhere with low oil pressure or engine problems.\nKeeping a close eye on the state of your engine is one of the smartest habits you can form when it comes to taking care of your vehicle. Learning to stay in the know with your oil levels is a great place to start. Get started today! If the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "How Long Does an Oil Change Take?",
        "content": "How Long Does an\u00a0Oil Change Take?\n\nThe duration of an oil change depends on several factors. Are you changing your own oil or taking it to a shop? Oil change professionals, especially those at \u201cquick lube\u201d shops, change oil every day and are generally good at changing oil quickly; but you might take a little bit longer if you\u2019re changing oil yourself, especially if you only do this as often as is needed by your vehicle.\nIf you bring your vehicle in, expect to wait between 15 and 45 minutes for an oil change. If you take your vehicle to a quick lube shop and can be seen immediately, the process can take as little as 15 minutes. Longer estimates typically account for wait time due to customer backlog: the other customers who scheduled their service or got there before you did.\nA repair shop may take a bit longer, so expect a wait time between 30 and 45 minutes at these locations. Finally, DIY oil changes typically take between 30 minutes and an hour, depending on your tools, experience, and garage setup.\nAnother factor is what kind of car you drive. Many cars have oil drain plugs and filters that are easily accessible on the bottom of the vehicle, but not all cars do. If your car\u2019s plug is less accessible, it might be a bit more difficult and time-consuming.\n\nWhy Do Repair Shops Take Longer Than\u00a0Quick Lube Shops?\n\nThere are two main factors that make a quick lube shop faster than a repair shop. First, a quick lube shop specializes in oil changes, so the setup may be geared toward rapid oil changes. Second, a repair shop typically performs other routine inspections and tune ups, so it can take additional time as they check your tire pressure, coolant level, and other maintenance areas.\nDetermine whether you need additional maintenance inspections or not before choosing the best professional to service your vehicle. While a repair shop may spot other issues that need immediate attention, a quick lube shop typically performs an oil change much more quickly and affordably. If you consistently have your oil changed at a quick lube location, consider scheduling routine inspections at your local auto repair shop for preventative maintenance and other fluid top-off.\n\nIs It Faster to Change\u00a0My Own Oil?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to save money and take charge of caring for your automobile, you may be asking, \u201cCan I change my own oil?\u201d Changing your own oil is possible, but it typically takes longer than a professional job. If you have professional tools and enough experience, you may be able to change your oil in as little as 30 minutes. That said, it is highly unlikely that you\u2019ll change your oil faster than a professional could, if for no other reason, because the professional does oil changes potentially every day. It may, however, save you money, and it could be fun too!\nLearn how to change your car\u2019s oil\n\nHow Often Should I\u00a0Change My Oil?\n\nWhile the old rule of thumb has always been 3,000 miles or three months in between oil changes, this is a general, and outdated, idea. While it\u2019s essential to have oil changes that keep your vehicle running efficiently and keep your warranties valid, many vehicles perform well after 3,000 miles.\nSome vehicles need oil changes even more frequently. If you only drive your vehicles at low speeds and are frequently starting up your engine, you may need an oil change as often as every 1,000 miles. Vehicles that consistently drive only 10 miles or less can collect condensation in the system, which causes oil to break down faster.\n\nWhat Happens\u00a0if I Don\u2019t Change My Oil?\n\nChanging your oil frequently helps extend the lifetime of your engine\u00a0and other components. Like most people, you\u2019ve probably run your vehicle for several hundred miles past the recommended point. What happens if you don\u2019t change your oil exactly on schedule? While occasionally pushing past the recommended interval may not be noticeable, over time it can have adverse effects.\nOld oil becomes opaque and dark black, and causes sludge to build up in your engine. Over time, it can create friction points, clog components, and cause engine seizure. While this is an extreme situation, it\u2019s important to keep your oil new, clean, and ready to properly lubricate all the moving components in your engine.\n\nWhat Type of Oil\u00a0Do I Need?\n\nNow that you know how often to change oil, it\u2019s time to pick out the best oil for your vehicle. Your owner\u2019s manual will specify the exact weight of oil for your vehicle. The weight of oil, such as 5W-20 or 10W-30, describes the viscosity at the ideal operating temperatures of your oil.

        "title": "Oil Recycling: How to Dispose of Motor Oil",
        "content": "Why Should You Recycle Motor Oil?\n\nIf you already handle your own oil changes (or have considered starting), you\u2019ve most likely had someone tell you how important it is that you recycle your used oil. Is recycling really that important though? What\u2019s the worst that could happen if you just toss it in the garbage or dump it down the drain? Surely one person\u2019s choice not to bother doesn\u2019t make that big a difference, right? Actually, one batch of oil from a single oil change can make a massive difference one way or the other. Here\u2019s how:\nAs anyone who\u2019s ever dealt with oil knows all too well, it sticks to pretty much everything it touches, including water. Pouring your used oil into the gutter, down a storm drain, or anywhere else it shouldn\u2019t go can contaminate bodies of water like lakes, oceans, and rivers. It can also harm or kill the animals and plants that call it home.The amount of oil involved in just one oil change has the potential to affect up to a million gallons of water.It\u2019s actually illegal to dispose of your used motor oil incorrectly, so insisting on doing so could carry serious repercussions. You may be fined, face jail time, or be held responsible for any clean-up costs. Those can definitely cost a pretty penny.\nLearning how to recycle motor oil isn\u2019t just about avoiding the possible negative consequences of doing otherwise either. Recycled motor oil can be refined and redistributed pretty much indefinitely. Two and a half quarts of clean, user-ready motor oil requires a whopping 42 gallons of crude oil to produce. However, that same amount of clean oil can be repurposed from just a gallon of previously used motor oil. Naturally, recycling is significantly easier on the environment, not to mention a powerful way to reduce your own carbon footprint.\nThe process of recycling used motor oil is actually pretty simple. Here\u2019s how you can go about doing a thorough job each and every time your ride is due for a fresh batch.\n\nHow to Recycle Oil\n\n Contain the oil The key to successful, responsible oil recycling is making sure you capture it all. Lay down a tarp or plastic sheet underneath your work area. Then position a proper container on top of your tarp and underneath your engine to catch the oil as it drains. (A drip pan that comes complete with a spout is going to be your best pick.) Empty the filter Make sure you include your oil filter in your efforts! Start by puncturing a small hole in the dome of your filter and allowing it to drain thoroughly into your drip pan along with the rest of the oil you\u2019ve collected. Then seal the filter into a plastic bag. Even after you\u2019ve drained it, it could contain many ounces of residual oil and can be recycled as well. Get your oil ready for transportation When you\u2019re done, you may need to transfer your oil from your drip pan to another container for storage and transportation, but it\u2019s important to select one that\u2019s appropriate. Don\u2019t use milk cartons, empty juice containers, or any other random container you may have lying around the house. If you happen to have the original container the oil came in, you should use that. Otherwise, you\u2019ll want to use something made of polyethylene or another plastic deemed suitable for the purpose. Also, some oil pans are made such that they can be sealed closed. These pans make it easy to contain and transport used oil.Motor oil that\u2019s been mixed with other fluids (either accidentally or purposefully) isn\u2019t recyclable, so take care not to let yours mingle with washer fluid, gasoline, or any other liquid (water included). Make sure your storage container has never been used to store other fluids at any point, even if it was a long time ago. Storing used oil  \nWhat Should You Do With\u00a0Successfully Collected Oil?\n\nDepending on where you live, you may be able to turn your used motor oil in via your city\u2019s curbside recycling program. If your city does allow for this, make sure you carefully research packaging requirements and protocol. (Never simply toss a container of used motor oil into your standard recycling bin.) If curbside recycling for motor oil isn\u2019t a possibility in your city, then you\u2019ll need to make plans to drop it off yourself at a participating recycling center.\nDon\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not quite sure where to take your oil or if the nearest recycling center is a little off the beaten trail for you. Most AutoZone stores accept used motor oil, as well as other sensitive recyclables (like batteries). Get in touch with your friendly neighborhood location today for all the details. When you\u2019re done dropping off your used oil, you can pick up a fresh jug of new\u00a0engine oil\u00a0while you\u2019re there. Get started today!",

        "title": "What Engine Oil Should You Use in the Winter?",
        "content": "Understanding Oil Types\n\nThere are many different brands of oil. Some oil brands include additives meant to clean your engine or perform better under certain conditions, while others are more cost-effective for general driving. All major oil brands, however, use the same system to categorize oils. Shop for oils based on the oil weight.\nOil weight is expressed with two numbers (i.e. 5W-20, 10W-40, etc.). Each of these numbers are essential to understanding how that particular oil weight will perform in winter and summer driving conditions.\nThe first number is the winter viscosity rating, or the viscosity when your oil is at zero degrees Fahrenheit. That\u2019s why that number is followed by a W. The second number is the viscosity rating for hot oil, typically measured at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\nA low beginning number, typically 5W, means that your oil will continue to flow well at low temperatures. Too thick and the oil won\u2019t properly flow and lubricate your engine\u2019s moving components. However, the second number should be higher for optimal functioning. A high second number allows your oil to stay at a reasonable thickness when heated, as hot oil can easily become too thin to adequately coat your engine\u2019s moving parts.\nNearly every motor oil comes with 20% additives. These additives include:\n\nFriction modifiers \nDispersants \nViscosity index improvers \nDetergents \n\nWhen selecting your oil weight, be sure to consult your owner\u2019s manual to ensure you fill up with the correct weight oil for optimal engine protection and performance.\n\nChoosing Synthetic or Conventional Oil\n\nOil can be synthetic or conventional, or even a blend of the two. Find out what type of oil you\u2019re currently using and determine whether you want to upgrade to a different oil type or continue to use the same, reliable option.\nConventional oil is the most cost-effective option. Unless you\u2019re driving in extreme conditions or driving a luxury vehicle with a high-tech engine, you should be able to find a suitable conventional oil for your engine. Synthetic oil, on the other hand, is the purest, most premium oil on the market. Synthetic oil continues to flow at a reliable rate through a wider range of temperatures, making it an ideal option for high-speed driving or for winter travel.\nFor a better balance between synthetic and conventional oil, you can choose a synthetic blend. This balanced option gives you a reasonable range of use without the price tag of full synthetic.\nIf you do your winter driving in a vehicle with more than 75,000 miles on the odometer, then the best choice for you is high-mileage oil. This rugged option still comes in oil weights suitable for cold temperatures, but also is designed to last longer. Typical conventional oil may not be suitable for vehicles who have clocked in over 75,000 miles. Choose a specialized oil designed for higher mileage use to keep your engine running strong.\n\nHow Winter Affects Engine Oil\n\nNow that you\u2019ve determined the type of oil, it\u2019s time to find out the best oil weight to achieve optimal viscosity in the winter, which you can do by consulting your owner\u2019s manual or looking it up on our website. \n\nWhy is viscosity important? Your engine oil needs to stay within a particular range of viscosity for optimal lubrication. Thin oil may not coat friction points properly, but thick oil won\u2019t move quick enough to keep your engine moving.\n\nDriving in winter exposes your vehicle to extreme temperature fluctuations. From the bitter cold of a long winter\u2019s night to the burning hot temperatures of your running engine, your vehicle needs oil that can perform well under extreme conditions.\n\nWhen to Change Your Oil\n\nEven the best oil gets dirty. Investing in top-quality oil isn\u2019t going to help your engine run properly if it isn\u2019t consistently changed. Consult your owner\u2019s manual and your oil to see how often you should change your oil.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure, contact your local AutoZone store or mechanic to determine whether you\u2019re due for a change. Old oil is worn-out and clogged with contaminants, which can compromise it\u2019s viscosity rating. Routine oil changes allow you to get the most out of your investment and keep your engine running smoothly.\nWhen your oil is low, it may be tempting to simply top it off and continue driving. While this may be a short-term solution, there are a few considerations you need to take into account. First, mixing old oil and new oil doesn\u2019t clear it of any contaminants, so you\u2019ll shorten the lifespan of your new oil. Second, if your new oil is of a higher quality or different weight than your old oil, your could reduce its effectiveness. Finally, you should change your oil filter and perform other essential maintenance steps every time you change your oil. Topping off your oil instead of changing it could cause other maintenance steps to be neglected.\n\nThe Best Winter Engine Oil \n\nNow that you understand the different weights and types of oil, it\u2019s time to select the best winter engine oil for your vehicle. Which oil is best for your car and your geographic location? The exact brand and type of oil depends on your vehicle and driving style, but dual-grade oils are the best options for winter engine oil because they are more versatile and ready to work at low temperatures. You can find oils that are made for your engine by entering your vehicle\u2019s information to use our oil type lookup. Whether you face sub-zero temperatures or barely reach freezing during the winter, choose a dependable oil for your vehicle in order to avoid engine damage and undue friction.",

        "title": "What Does Oil Do for a Car's Engine?",
        "content": "What Does Motor Oil Actually Do?\n\nWhat does Motor Oil Do?\nTo understand the function of motor oil, it\u2019s first important to at least get a basic understanding of how your engine works. You don\u2019t need to get too technical to really understand what oil does: rather, the most important thing to understand is that there are many moving parts inside your engine. These moving parts not only rub against each other, they also produce a great amount of heat.\nEssentially, motor oil acts as the lubricant that allows all of these moving parts inside your engine to rub against each other and not overheat or wear out quickly. If you were to try and drive your car with no motor oil inside of it, very quickly, that heat and friction would cause the engine to weld itself into a useless piece of metal. When this happens to a car engine, the engine seizes or \u201clocks up.\u201d Once an engine is locked up, there\u2019s basically nothing that can be done to fix it. Other than, of course, replacing the entire engine.\nObviously, most motorists want to avoid this, and thus ensure that their car has sufficient motor oil to coat and protect its moving parts against excessive wear.\nIn addition to the heat generated from all of the moving components of the engine rubbing against each other, engines run off of a process called internal combustion. This process of combustion produces a lot of water vapor, carbon, acids, and several other byproducts.\nWay back in the day, engines actually didn\u2019t have an oil pump to help move the oil around the engine. Rather, they used a very rudimentary system of dippers on the crankshaft which would then splash oil upward and cover the moving parts of the engine with oil. (Many lawn mowers still operate this way.)\nHowever, this process is obviously imperfect, and usually would result in a locked up engine after a period of time. Over time the process of\u202foil delivery\u202fdid improve, but it also took a while for\u202foil filters\u202fto start showing up on automobiles; they were still considered an option well into the 1950\u2019s. What a filter does is help remove unwanted particles from the oil, such as carbon and metals. Prior to the addition of oil filters, older engines would need to go through a process known as \u201cde-coking\u201d in order to remove the build-up, which would settle in the oil pan, or anywhere motor oil could pool.\n\u201cDe-coking\u201d would involve running a mixture of diluted kerosene and oil through the engine as a flush, and hope that it would help remove some of the carbon and sludge buildup. However, this was also not a very precise process or thorough process, and normally wouldn\u2019t do much, if not damage the engine. Thus, prior to modern oils now have detergents to battle this, along with oil filters. In the \u201cgood old days\u201d, engines would rarely make it over 100,000 miles without needing to be rebuilt. Anyone who has cracked open an older engine from the 1950\u2019s to the 1970\u2019s usually has a story about \u201cthat one engine\u201d that had enough sludge in it that it was a wonder it ever ran at all.\nBasically, your car\u2019s engine is a very complex place, and, due to the movement and heat generated by the process of combustion, a very dirty place. Not only does oil lubricate the parts inside of your engine to ensure overheating does not occur, it also helps to keep the engine clean.\n\nDoes Switching Between Conventional and Synthetic Oils Cause Problems?\n\nOriginally, all motor oils were mineral-based. After years of development, synthetic blend oil started to appear on the market. For a while, it was \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that switching to a synthetic oil after using mineral-based oils in an engine would result in problems like burning oil or potential leakage.\nAt this point, these theories have all but been disproven. (This is similar to how some people swear up and down that manual cars get better gas mileage as compared to automatic cars. This may have had plausibility at one time, but not so much anymore.) In fact, synthetic motor oil is actually better than conventional oil in a multitude of ways.\nFirst of all, synthetic oil has a higher percentage of purity as compared to conventional oils. Conventional oils are going to have a certain amount of impurities by its very nature: for example, paraffin molecules. On the other hand, synthetic oil is pure all the way through. This means lubricity is better, and ultimately longevity is better.  \nAdditionally, synthetic oil was invented for the sole purpose of having an oil that could maintain a better viscosity in extreme cold and hot temperatures. All oils are going to thicken up drastically as the temperature plummets, but synthetic oils will maintain a better viscosity at these extreme temperatures, and adversely, in extreme heat, will resist vaporization better.\nParticularly if your car is a more modern model, it\u2019s important to go with synthetic oil. This is because synthetic oil has much greater shear strength as compared to conventional oil. Basically, if there is enough pressure, the very molecules of conventional oil can be torn apart. This doesn\u2019t happen with synthetic oil, and given the very tight tolerances of modern engine build, this strength factor is paramount for peak engine performance and protection.\nNo matter what kind of vehicle you own, it\u2019s very important for the engine to have an appropriate amount and variety of motor oil. Failure to have enough can result in engine lockage, meaning that you\u2019ll have a very expensive mess on your hands. Make sure to change your oil and oil filter regularly for top performance.",

        "title": "Motor Oil: What Do Grades Mean For Your Engine?",
        "content": "What Are the Numbers on an Oil Container?\n\nThe numbers indicate the oil grade, which is a measure of its viscosity. A layman can think of viscosity as a liquid\u2019s thickness. Consider the difference between pouring a glass of water versus waiting for the ketchup to slide out of the bottle. Ketchup has a high viscosity whereas water has very low viscosity.\nNow imagine trying to put a number on the difference between the thickness of ketchup and water. This was exactly the problem faced by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) with oil viscosity. The SAE\u2019s solution was the measure the rate at which oil traveled through a standardized opening at specific temperatures.\nThe grades you see on bottles represent the measurements based on flow time. It\u2019s not as simple as saying \u201chigher numbers are better\u201d because some oils perform better at different temperatures than others. The oil you want depends on your vehicle and the environment in which you drive.\n\nWhat Does the W Mean?\n\nWhile many drivers think it means weight, the W in the grade actually stands for winter. The first number can be thought of as the oil\u2019s cold-temperature performance. Oil thickens as it becomes colder, making it harder to pump through your engine. Pancake syrup is an excellent visualization here as it\u2019s fairly thick when cold but almost water-like when hot.\nThe difference in the viscosity is the reason you see multiple numbers on grades, such as 5W-30. The number preceding the W is a measurement of the oil\u2019s flow at 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The lower the first number is, the better the oil flows at below freezing temperatures. So 0W-30 would be a better cold-weather lubricant than 5W-30.\nThis is important because if oil becomes too thick it becomes almost impossible for your system to pump. A sudden surge of cold, thick lubricant can put a hole in your filter, preventing it from cleaning your oil properly. If no oil is pumped at all, you experience a catastrophic engine failure. Always use the correct winter ratings when driving in a cold environment.\n\nWhat Does the Number After the Dash Mean?\n\nWhile engines are always hot when they run, hot weather puts even more stress on your oil. In the cold, having a thin oil prevents your car\u2019s lubricant from becoming too thick. High temperatures thin out your oil, necessitating a higher viscosity. If oil becomes too thin, it doesn\u2019t clean your engine well. The debris in your system causes poor performance and gas mileage. Even worse, thin oil doesn\u2019t absorb enough heat, which can cause your engine to overheat and fail.\nThink of the number after the dash as the oil\u2019s high-temperature rating. In this case, the SAE measures the time it takes for the oil to travel through an opening at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the second number of the grade is, the better the oil stands up to heat. Using 20W-50, for instance, would be an excellent choice if you lived in the tropics.\nThat\u2019s why 5W-30 is one of the most commonly used lubricants. In temperate regions, such as most of the United States and Europe, it works well whether you\u2019re driving in the summer or winter. This is why multi-grade oils have become so popular in recent years: they provide better overall protection than monograde lubricants.\n\nWhat Does It Mean When There\u2019s No Dash?\n\nIf you see a rating such as SAE 30, this is a monograde oil. Chances are this bottle is not designed as an automotive lubricant. All modern engines use oil whether they\u2019re on cars or not. Some don\u2019t need the advanced lubricants used by today\u2019s automobiles. Riding mowers, generators, and chainsaws can run just fine on monograde oil.\nYou may be wondering, \u201cCan you use SAE 30 motor oil in a car?\u201d The answer is that this type is generally suitable only for antique cars. Even if it rarely gets cold near you, it\u2019s best not to risk your engine during an early morning ignition. Multi-grade oils protect your vehicle and help it to work better as well.\n\nWhat Kind of Oil Should I Buy?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to worry about the exact temperature of your driving environment every time you buy oil. Your car or truck has all the info you need about purchasing oil in its service manual. It should tell you the exact type and grade used by your engine. It may even have recommendations for cold- or hot-weather oils if you\u2019re doing some traveling.\nIf you live somewhere with wide temperature swings, don\u2019t fret about finding the perfect lubricant.\n5W-40 oil works well in freezing or sweltering conditions, so it\u2019s always a good choice provided it matches your engine. Even if it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t forget that you change your oil multiple times during the year. This gives you the opportunity to switch grades to match the next season\u2019s weather.\nWhile motor oil grades can be surprisingly complex, finding the right one is fairly easy. As long as you check your owner\u2019s manual you should get the right lubricant. If you\u2019re interested in saving money, do your own oil changes. Not only is it much cheaper, you get a better feel for the condition of your vehicle. Oil replacements are the most important kind of regular maintenance on your car, so it\u2019s a good idea to take charge of them yourself. Shop engine oil online to find high-quality lubricants at the right price.\nLearn more about motor oil:\n\nThe advantages of synthetic oil\nWhat is high mileage oil?",

        "title": "Is Synthetic Oil Worth It?",
        "content": "What Is Synthetic Oil?\n\nFull synthetic oil, compared to traditional motor oil, is exactly what it sounds like. It consists entirely of synthetic compounds. To be more specific, it consists of a base oil that is fortified with beneficial powder compounds and then blended with a carrier oil to ensure an even, homogenous composition.\nConventional motor oil is usually mineral based. However, you may also be familiar with synthetic blend oils, as they\u2019ve been around for quite some time as well. Keeping your car\u2019s engine well-lubricated with clean, good quality oil is an essential part of keeping it in good working order for many years to come.\n\nHow Much Does Synthetic Oil Cost?\n\nOne of the main reasons people are hesitant to just jump right into the switch is the typical synthetic oil change price. Fully synthetic oil can cost more than the conventional options most people are used to. In some cases, synthetic oil may even cost up to triple the cost of an organic or semi-organic oil, particularly at an oil change service center.\nHow much is a full synthetic oil change as compared to the usual treatment? A standard oil change using typical mineral-based motor oil will usually set you back about $25-50 depending on your vehicle and the mechanic you go to. Upgrading that same oil change service to include full synthetic oil will cost around $45-100 instead.\nOf course, there are additional factors that should be considered as well. To begin with, synthetic oil doesn\u2019t actually have to be changed as often as conventional oils, so you can safely extend the amount of time you take in between visits to the mechanic. There are also the possible performance changes to consider.\n\nWhat Are the Main Benefits of Synthetic Oil?\n\nNow that you know what synthetic oil is, it\u2019s time to consider the possible benefits. The following are among the most important reasons why your mechanic has probably been offering synthetic options.\n\n1. Longer Vehicle Life Span\n\nThe whole point of staying on top of tune-ups, maintenance visits, and oil changes is to extend the life of your vehicle, right? Well, going full synthetic may be one of the better ways to make sure that really happens. This is especially the case if you use your vehicle the way most people do \u2013 to make multiple short daily trips to work, to the store, to pick up your kids from school, and so forth.\nSynthetic oil warms up enough during such trips to get rid of the dirt and impurities it\u2019s supposed to, while traditional organic oils sometimes don\u2019t. Synthetics are a lot more molecularly stable, so they don\u2019t deteriorate as quickly either. This allows them to offer your engine better, more thorough protection under extreme conditions. These include very high or low weather temperatures, as well as instances where you may be towing or carrying heavy loads.\n\n2. Less Build-Up\n\nIf your mechanic has been trying to sell you on the benefits of synthetics, he\u2019s probably mentioned the difference in sludge build-up a time or two. Sludge is that nasty, scummy cocktail of paraffin, carbon, debris, and other miscellaneous compounds that eventually accumulates inside your engine. While sludge build-up is definitely not good for any engine, it can be especially bad for older engines that have been around the block a time or two.\nEngines that are 10-20 years old or more aren\u2019t quite as good at managing that icky, sludgy residue as they might have been when they were brand new. Traditional mineral-based motor oils tend to generate much more of this nasty build-up more quickly than full synthetic oils. That said, making the switch is going to give your engine the best possible chance at a nice, long life.\n\n3. Fewer Oil Changes\n\nYou really won\u2019t have to change your oil as often if you make the switch to synthetic, which may be the most common reason people eventually take the plunge. A standard batch of traditional oil should be changed about every 3,000 miles. However, even the lowest-quality synthetic oil can last a good 5,000 miles before you have to think about a change. Some brands can last between 15,000 and 25,000 miles between oil changes, so that\u2019s really quite the difference. Keep in mind, you should always heed your manufacturer\u2019s recommended change intervals first and foremost.\n\nIs Synthetic\u00a0Right for You?\n\nSo is full synthetic oil worth it? If the recommendations of top auto manufacturers, mechanics, and other automotive experts mean anything to you, then yes. Making the switch is absolutely worth it, especially in the long run. Yes, you\u2019ll pay more for the cost of the oil itself, but you\u2019ll save in time and expense over the long haul. Your vehicles will not only run better, but they\u2019ll last longer. Plus, you won\u2019t have to worry about oil changes nearly as often, so it\u2019s a convenient choice as well.",

These could also be signs that it\u2019s time:\n\nIncreased oil consumption\nEngine is slow to start in cold or runs hot on warmer days\nDecrease in throttle response\nDecrease in gas mileage\nMinor leaks\n\n3 Ways High Mileage Oil Protects Engines Better Than Conventional\n\n1. Prevent Leaks with Seal Conditioners\n\nSeal conditioners recondition seals that shrink and become brittle due to natural aging. High mileage oils also contain seal sweller and conditioners to help reduce leaks, eliminate smoking and improve engine performance.\n\n2. Clean Engines with Extra Detergents\n\nDetergents help keep older engines running clean. Engines with high mileage create sludge faster than newer engines. High mileage oils contain anti-oxidant additives to fight sludge and help prevent viscosity breakdown.\n\n3. Fight Friction with Extra Anti-Wear Agents\n\nAnti-wear agents help prevent future wear.

        "content": "What is Zinc, anyway?\n\nZinc is the only element that starts with Z, and it\u2019s a vitamin listed on food packaging, which are the two things that make it the most famous. It\u2019s also used to fight corrosion, as a galvanizing agent, is critical to create brass, and shows up in thousands of compounds that affect your everyday life. Check out the Zinc wiki page with 270+ sources to read up on all that.\nWe\u2019re here to talk about motor oil. \n\nWhat does Zinc have to do with motor oil?\n\n\u201cZinc\u201d in motor oil usually is describing a compound called  Zinc Dialkyl Dithiophosphates or ZDDP. According to Valvoline, \u201cits primary role is to prevent metal-to-metal contact between engine parts by forming a protective film. Despite being referred to as zinc, ZDDP also contains phosphorus, which helps to perform the anti-wear function in the motor oil.\u201d\nZinc acts as a friction inhibitor, and research suggests that older engines using \u201cflat tappet\u201d lifters in the engine (pretty much any V6 or V8 older than 1988) need to have zinc present in the engine oil in order to keep the camshaft and lifters from wearing prematurely.  \n\nSo why isn\u2019t Zinc or ZDDP in modern motor oil?\n\nHerein lies the problem. About 10 years ago, it was also discovered that in general oil consumption, Zinc, especially the phosphorus present in ZDDP, is a primary cause of premature catalytic converter failure. With the government setting mandates on manufacturers covering the service life of catalytic converters over 100,000 miles, this caused nearly every oil manufacturer over the last 10 years to slowly remove zinc from the ingredients in their oil. Diesel oils soon followed suit, until today, no oil that is approved for on-road use contains Zinc. This of course doesn\u2019t affect newer engines with roller lifters or overhead cams at all \u2013 but for older engines \u2013 it limits the options for oils with ZDDP.  \nCurrently, very few oils on the market contain zinc \u2013 and all of these are designated as \u201coff-road\u201d oils, such as Valvoline racing oil. However, if you\u2019re looking to add Zinc, there are of Zinc additives, that, when coupled with your favorite oil, provide the protection you need.  \n\nZinc is not only critical for older flat-tappet engines, but many argue it\u2019s critical for new engine break-in. An engine\u2019s break in period is critical for its long-term success, as everything from main and rod bearings, to rings, cams and oil pump are getting adjusted to their new life.  Remember, if you have an older vehicle, whether it\u2019s a 1966 Mustang or a 1979 Ford pickup, it\u2019s a good idea to put zinc into the oil. \nMore on Synthetic and Conventional Oil\nNeed Zinc additive or oil advice?

        "title": "How to Upgrade Performance",
        "content": "How to Upgrade to a High Performance\n\n1. Upgrade the Engine\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to look at your engine as a big air pump. The faster and better the air flows through the engine, the faster your car will move. One great upgrade that can help achieve this is a cold air intake system. Brands like Specter and K&N offer high-performance systems that replace the factory air filter and intake housing. This design reduces intake restrictions and allows for a larger amount of air to flow into the engine, resulting in more usable power and better acceleration.\n\n2. Upgrade the Exhaust System\n\nAnother way to increase horsepower is to improve the performance and sound of your exhaust system. Replacing the factory mufflers with high-flow performance mufflers from Flow Master or Magna Flow can make a significant difference. If you\u2019re not comfortable with cutting and welding, a local muffler shop can help with the installation. Another option is a cat-back exhaust system that replaces the factory system from the catalytic converters to the rear of the car. This upgrade can be done with simple hand tools and provides real performance gains.\nA full performance exhaust system can also free up some horsepower. There are two options to choose from \u2013 a bolt-on kit designed to fit your car or a universal kit from Flow Master that you can customize to fit your vehicle. The full system includes mandrel bends to reduce resistance and an option for a crossover pipe or an X pipe for scavenging. You can also choose the performance muffler that best suits your performance goals or desired sound. This is a heavy DIY project that requires cutting and welding, so a local exhaust shop can help if you\u2019re not comfortable with your skills.\n\n3. Upgrade the brakes\n\nIf you want a car that goes fast, then you better make sure it can stop fast, and upgrading your brakes is something that most of us can do. For performance, you want to look at your pads, calipers, and your rotors. And if you want a little extra flare, you can use some custom caliper covers, or go on to the full brake kit.\n\n4. Upgrade Tires & Handling\n\nYou have got to be able to control your car, especially when it\u2019s screaming at the top of its RPM range. You can really improve the handling with some performance tires, and you can get better feedback with a performance steering wheel. Most stock steering wheels are typically a larger diameter; they\u2019re made from molded plastic, and they can be hard to hang on to in extreme conditions. A smaller diameter wheel, covered in leather or suede give you better feedback, a better grip, and better car control.\n\n5. Upgrade fluids and chemicals\n\nHigh performance means high heat, and if you\u2019re dealing with high heat, you\u2019ve got to go with synthetic. One of the best benefits of synthetic oil is that the oil itself doesn\u2019t break down as fast. The viscosity stays the same for a longer period of time, and especially under extreme conditions. But it\u2019s not just your engine oil. Synthetic and performance fluids throughout your vehicle can free up horsepower with less friction, and better protect your parts under stress, all at the same time. \n\n6. Reprogram the system\n\nPower programmers are a simple and proven way to really wake up your car, providing power gains up to 30 horsepower or even more in some diesel applications. They use a data cable that connects the programmer to your car\u2019s computer by plugging into the car\u2019s diagnostic port of a \u201996 and newer vehicle. A programmer can access and change tuning data that controls air and fuel into your engine, timing events, even transmission shift points, and line pressures to give you more power and a better performance feel, better towing, and even better fuel economy, depending on how the programmer is set.",

        "title": "How Do Oil Filters Work?",
        "content": "Introduction to Oil filters\n\nEngine oil contains detergent. High-quality oil contains better detergent, and more of it. That cleaning agent helps to prevent pollutants from sticking to internal engine parts. Instead, those harmful materials are held in suspension within the engine oil, where they are delivered, under high pressure and flow rate, to the oil filter.\nAs the name implies, an oil filter strains and filters particles out of the engine oil. Why is that necessary? Because the inside of an engine is a dirty place. As fuel burns, it produces many harmful byproducts. Those are things like ash, carbon, chemical toxins, moisture, and worst of all, sludge. Sludge is that gooey, thick, messy substance you might see accumulating under the oil fill cap. If you left all those pollutants to circulate freely with the engine oil, they would soon destroy expensive internal engine parts.\nOil filters capture the harmful particles in folds or pleats so they can be disposed of when you change the oil. That way, there\u2019s no chance that these abrasive, sludgy bits will find their way into your engine again, contaminating new oil.\n\nHow Oil Filters Work\n\nThe filter has a membrane material that traps and holds those foreign substances. High-quality oil filters have a finer membrane, and more of it, to do a better job of filtering under adverse conditions, like in extreme heat or cold, stop and go driving, or frequent short trips. Why are frequent short trips so bad?\nBecause a cold engine produces more harmful by-products of combustion than a hot engine does. Also, it doesn\u2019t get hot enough, and doesn\u2019t stay hot long enough to burn off some of those pollutants. That means more work for the oil filter.\nEither way, the filter can\u2019t hold an infinite amount of toxins. That\u2019s why we replace the oil filter with every oil change. It\u2019s a little amount to spend to protect the very expensive engine.\n\nTypes of Engine Oil Filters\n\nWhen it boils down to it, there are two main types of oil filters that you\u2019ll come across:\n\nA canister-style filter looks similar to a soup can that threads onto an adapter that feeds engine oil through it. The filter media or membrane is contained inside it, making it simple to unscrew and toss out when the time comes. They\u2019re normally found on the bottom of the engine block or on the side halfway down. It\u2019s the most common type, especially on older vehicles.\nA cartridge-style, or a drop-in oil filter, is in a housing under the hood with a cap on it. The filter media tends to have a much larger surface area than canister-style filters, and it\u2019s easy to inspect for debris and sludge when you\u2019re changing the oil.\n\nRegardless of which type your car uses, you can minimize engine maintenance and repairs by using high-efficiency oil filters. Look for oil filters that report the ability to trap virtually all particles that are 20 microns in size or larger, since it\u2019s these bits that are most harmful to your engine. That\u2019s not to say other oil filters can\u2019t do the job, but for a few extra dollars a couple of times per year, is it worth the risk?\n\nChoosing the Right Oil Filter\n\nChoosing the right oil filter is crucial for ensuring your engine performance remains at the top of its game and lasts a long time. When selecting an oil filter, consider factors such as:\n\nFiltration efficiency, as mentioned. Look for filters that strain the most contaminants.\nCompatibility with your vehicle\u2019s make and model. Other sizes and styles simply won\u2019t work properly. For example, a canister filter that\u2019s too wide won\u2019t seal against the engine well.\nThe type of oil you\u2019re using. Some filters are intended for use with synthetic oil, for example.\nYour mileage. For models with higher mileage, some options provide better protection against wear-causing contaminants.\n\nOEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) filters are specifically designed for your vehicle, offering a seamless fit and meeting manufacturer specifications. However, many aftermarket filters provide cost-effective alternatives with the same or better performance. Just ensure they meet or exceed OEM standards.\nUnderstanding oil filter specifications is key to making an informed choice. Look for features like:\n\nAn anti-drain back valve that prevents oil from draining out of the filter when the engine is turned off. It ensures that the engine receives oil quickly upon startup, reducing wear and tear.\nA by-pass valve that allows oil to flow around the filter if it becomes clogged, ensuring a continuous supply of oil to the engine in case the filter reaches its capacity.\nFilter media such as synthetic or cellulose filter media. Synthetic media often provides better filtration and durability, especially in extreme conditions.\nThread size and O-ring specifications that match your vehicle\u2019s specifications, including the correct thread size and O-ring dimensions, is crucial for a proper fit.\n\nWhen to Replace Oil Filters\n\nChange your oil filter as part of routine maintenance. The life and longevity of your engine depends greatly on its oil filter. Ignore it, leave it on too long, and you could be facing some very expensive repair bills.\nOil filter replacement varies a great deal between different models, but it\u2019s easiest to track when you do it every time you change the engine oil. Many older vehicles have a three-month or 3,000-mile interval for oil changes, whereas newer cars can be a set interval such as 5,000 miles or at least two times per year, or according to an oil life monitoring system that can sometimes be as high as 15,000 miles.\nThe best way to determine when to change an oil filter is based on your specific vehicle\u2019s oil change requirements in the service schedule. In addition, if you inspect the oil and it\u2019s milky, dark brown or black, or has metallic speckles in it, change the oil immediately.\nIf you fancy yourself a DIYer, changing your own oil filter isn\u2019t difficult, and it only requires a few tools like a drain pan for the old oil and an oil filter wrench. Remove the oil filter after the oil has been drained to prevent a massive mess. Or, if you don\u2019t have the time to deal with your own maintenance, you can always bring your engine oil and a new filter to a professional to change it.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "What Should I Put In My Car?\n\nSynthetic and Conventional motor oil will both protect your engine, but synthetic oil will do it as much as 47% better* and resist breakdown under extreme temperature conditions. As with most maintenance, best practice is to follow the advice in your owner\u2019s manual. If your car does not absolutely require a certain type of oil, you can choose between the products based on performance and cost. While synthetic motor oils tend to be more expensive, they are shown to reduce buildup of sludge and operate more efficiently under extreme temperatures. For cars with over 75,000 miles, be sure to use a high mileage oil.\n\nBetter Protection For Longer\n\nJust like conventional oil, synthetic motor oils act as a barrier, protecting your engine components. When battling heat and friction, over time the additives in both oils will begin to break down, reducing their ability to protect your engine.\n\nReady to Go In, Hot or Cold\n\nSynthetics provide better cold weather protection through faster oil flow at start up. They also tend to resist breakdown better in high-heat situations, like summer or high-performance conditions.\n\nIt\u2019s Still About a Fit\n\nIf you\u2019re thorough and consistent about changing your oil on time, conventional motor oil will protect your engine. If you\u2019re looking for a product that is less likely to break down, or you\u2019re living and driving in a place with some major cold or extreme heat, synthetic oil can provide peace of mind along with superior protection. And if you\u2019re driving a performance vehicle, synthetic oil is almost always recommended.\n\nBetter for Turbo\n\nMany modern engines utilize a turbocharger for additional power, making heat resistance demands higher.

Oil serves as the lifeblood of your engine, lubricating its components, reducing friction, and carrying away heat. Over time, engine oil breaks down, loses its effectiveness, and can become contaminated with debris. Regular oil changes are crucial because they:\n\nProlong engine life. Clean oil helps reduce wear and tear on engine parts, extending its lifespan.\u00a0\nEnhance fuel efficiency. Fresh oil allows the engine to operate more efficiently, improving gas mileage.\nBoost performance. A well-lubricated engine performs better, providing a smoother and more powerful ride.\nPrevent costly repairs. Neglecting oil changes can lead to expensive engine damage.\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize the signs that your car is due for an oil change, which may include:\n\nOil pressure light. If a light shaped like an oil can illuminates on your dashboard, it could be a sign of low oil or sludge buildup that\u2019s blocking oil flow.\nLoud engine noise. An unusually loud engine noise, often described as knocking or tapping, can be a symptom of inadequate lubrication.\nDirty or dark oil. Checking your oil level and color on the dipstick can give you a quick indication of its condition. Clean oil is amber or light brown, while dirty oil is dark and sludgy.\nAn indicator is lit on the dash.

Often, it indicates oil life remaining, and anything under 10% means it\u2019s urgent to get it done.\n\nGathering the Necessary Tools\n\nBefore you dive into changing your car\u2019s oil, gather the right tools and materials. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need:\n\nOil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter.\nOil drain pan to collect the old oil for disposal.\nSocket set for loosening and tightening the oil drain plug.\nOil filter that\u2019s correct for your vehicle\u2019s make and model.\nNew engine oil of the recommended oil type and quantity for your engine.\nOil funnel to pour the new oil in.\nOil filter gasket if necessary. It\u2019s usually included with the new oil filter.\nOil filter wrench to remove and replace the oil filter.\n\nMaintaining an organized workspace can make the process go so much smoother. Here are some tips to help you stay organized:\n\nChoose the right location. Park your car on a level surface and ensure you have enough space to work comfortably.\nGather your tools and materials first. Lay out everything you need in advance, so you don\u2019t have to hunt for items while working.\nWear appropriate clothing. Dress in clothes you don\u2019t mind getting dirty, and consider using gloves to protect your hands.\nHave safety equipment nearby. Keep safety equipment like gloves, safety goggles, and a fire extinguisher within reach.\n\nStep-by-Step Oil Change Process\n\nNow that you\u2019re prepared let\u2019s dive into the step-by-step process of changing your car\u2019s oil.\n\nLocate the Oil Drain Plug and Filter\n\nStep 1: Locate the drain plug. Typically, it\u2019s at the rear side of the engine oil pan at the bottom. Position the oil drain pan beneath the oil drain plug.\nStep 2: Locate the oil filter. It will be either a metal cylinder that threads onto an oil filter adapter under your car or at the side of the engine, or it will be a cartridge that\u2019s inserted into a housing under the hood. If you\u2019re having trouble identifying the oil filter on your car, look in your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nDrain the Old Oil and Replacing the Filter\n\nStep 3: Drain the oil. Use the socket set to carefully loosen and remove the oil drain plug. Allow the old oil to drain completely into the pan.\nStep 4: Remove the oil filter. Once the oil is drained, remove the old oil filter using an oil filter wrench for cylinders, or remove the cap on the housing under the hood and pull out the old cartridge.\nStep 5: Lubricate the gasket. Before installing the new filter, apply a small amount of fresh oil to the rubber gasket. This will help promote a seal and let you tighten it enough.\nStep 6: Install the oil filter. Screw the new oil filter onto the filter housing, ensuring it\u2019s snug but not over-tightened.\nStep 7: Tighten the drain plug. Replace the oil drain plug and tighten it securely. It\u2019s often recommended to torque the drain plug to around 30 lb-ft, but check your owner\u2019s manual for the correct spec for your car.\n\nAdd New Oil and Check the Level\n\nStep 8: Add oil. Using a funnel, pour the recommended amount of new motor oil into the engine. When you\u2019re done, it should be between the \u2018FULL\u2019 and \u2018ADD\u2019 marks on the dipstick.\nStep 9: Run the engine and recheck the level.\u00a0 Run the engine to circulate the oil throughout. Then, recheck the oil level using the dipstick. Add more oil if necessary, but avoid overfilling.\n\nAlways use the proper equipment and be safe and careful when you\u2019re working on your car. If you jack up the front end of your car to change the oil, chock the rear wheels to prevent it from rolling and engage the parking brake. Let the engine cool sufficiently so you won\u2019t burn yourself when you\u2019re working on the engine or near the exhaust.\nThen, at the end, double-check that there aren\u2019t leaks or drips under your car.\n\nOil Disposal and Environmental Considerations\n\nNever dispose of used oil by pouring it down the drain or on the ground. Improper disposal of used oil can harm the environment, contaminating soil and water sources. Recycling used oil ensures that it can be cleaned and reused, reducing the need for new oil production and its associated environmental impact.\n\nOil Change Frequency and Maintenance Tips\n\nOil change intervals can vary depending on your vehicle\u2019s make, model, and the type of oil used. A general guideline is to change your oil every 3,000 to 5,000 miles or as recommended in your car\u2019s manual. However, modern vehicles and synthetic oils may allow for longer intervals \u2013 sometimes up to 15,000 miles or one year. Always consult your manual for specific recommendations.\nRegular oil changes are just one part of maintaining your vehicle. Consider these additional maintenance tasks to keep your car in top shape:\n\nCheck tire pressure and tread depth regularly.\nCheck the wiper blades and replace them as necessary, typically once a year. Periodically inspect the brakes, suspension, and steering, and lubricate any service points.\nCheck and top off fluids like coolant, transmission fluid, and brake fluid.\nReplace the engine air filter and cabin air filter as recommended in your car\u2019s manual, usually once per year.\n\nShop at your local AutoZone for your engine oil and filter, and any other fluids or parts you need to service your vehicle. You\u2019ll find top products and brands as well as helpful advice in-store and online.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Fix Peeling Clear Coat",
        "content": "Understanding Clear Coat Peeling\n\nBefore you start the repair process, it\u2019s vital to understand what clear coat peeling is and why it happens. The outermost layer on your car\u2019s paint job isn\u2019t actually tinted in most cases. It\u2019s a completely transparent coating that has a few purposes. First, it gives that wet shine that makes a good paint job so attractive. In addition, it protects the paint against corrosive substances like acid rain and bird droppings, plus it\u2019s a layer that can be waxed and polished, restoring your car\u2019s shine after it gets dull.\nPeeling clear coat is usually caused by prolonged exposure to the elements, such as UV rays, moisture, and airborne pollutants. Improper application during manufacture, including insufficient drying time between coats, can also lead to clear coat failure. Poor maintenance practices like infrequent washing, using abrasive cleaners, or neglecting to apply sealant can accelerate this process, causing the clear coat to lose its adhesion to the base coat.\nPeeling clear coat not only diminishes the visual appeal of your vehicle but also exposes the underlying paint to the elements. This can lead to premature fading, oxidation, and in extreme cases, the paint peeling off.\nRestoring the clear coat isn\u2019t just about making your car look good. It\u2019s about protecting your investment.\n\nDIY Clear Coat Repair Methods\n\nThere are a couple of approaches to fixing peeling clear coat, including quick fixes to more in-depth refinishing techniques. Here, you\u2019ll learn about the most effective do-it-yourself methods.\n\nTouch-up Paint\n\nThe simplest and most common repair is applying clear coat the same way you\u2019d apply touch-up paint. You can find it in a touch-up pen from most paint manufacturers, and it\u2019s easy to do, although it\u2019s only effective for tiny repairs like stone chips.\nAfter cleaning the surface and removing any loose, chipping clear coat, lightly sand the chip or scratch so the clear coat will adhere properly. Then, after thoroughly shaking the paint pen, apply a thin coat of clear coat to the area. Allow it to dry, then re-apply it until the chip or scratch is completely filled. It can be smoothed out using a common wet sanding method, and when it\u2019s done well, it can virtually hide the flaw.\n\nRespray Clear Coat\n\nThe second method is re-spraying the clear coat, and it\u2019s the proper repair when the damage is larger than a scratch or paint chip. It involves spraying the area for a uniform look that protects the paint underneath.\nThe key to a successful repair is thorough surface preparation. Start by washing the affected area with a mild detergent to remove dirt and grime. Then, use a quality automotive wax and grease remover to ensure the area is completely clean.\nOne of the easiest ways to fix clear coat peeling is with a clear coat repair kit. These kits typically include sandpaper, a primer, and a clear coat finish. They\u2019re sprayed on using a paint applicator gun and compressed air.\nThen, when the clear coat has dried and cured, it can be blended into the rest of the finish. Use fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out the peeling clear coat, beginning with 1500-grit and gradually moving to 3000-grit for a finer finish. After sanding, polish the area with a rubbing compound to restore the shine.\n\nTop Clear Coat Repair Products\n\nAccess to the right tools and materials is crucial for an effective clear coat repair. Explore our selection of top-rated products that can make your DIY repair job a smooth one.\nSelecting the right clear coat repair kit can significantly impact the quality and durability of the repair.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Dupli-Color Paint Shop Clear Coat Lacquer is a go-to choice for its quality and ease of use. It provides a high-gloss finish and UV protection, ensuring your clear coat stays in top shape.\nFor small repairs, use the Dupli-Color Universal Touch Up Paint Clear Coat Pen. The needle tip is perfect for small projects including minor scratches, and the brush inside can maje short work of small chips.\nThe Vaper HVLP Gravity Feed Air Spray Gun provides a consistent and smooth application of paint when you\u2019re working on larger paint repairs and treatments. You\u2019ll need a high-quality air compressor to use it.\nFor the final finish, buff the new clear coat to a perfect shine with the Griot\u2019s Garage 6-inch Random Orbital Polisher. It has six speed settings and is ideal for both the home DIYer and the pro. All you\u2019ll need to find are your polishing compounds and foam pad applicators.\n\nPreventing Future Clear Coat Issues\n\nOnce you\u2019ve fixed the peeling clear coat, it\u2019s important to take steps to prevent the issue from returning or to stop it in its tracks if it starts to reappear. Adopting good maintenance habits is the best way to ensure your clear coat stays intact. Regularly wash your vehicle with a pH-balanced car wash solution to remove contaminants that can degrade the clear coat. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or cloths, and never dry-wipe the car. Instead, use a microfiber drying towel to prevent scratching.\nAfter repairing the clear coat, apply a high-quality wax or sealant to provide an additional layer of protection. Remember to reapply wax or sealant as needed to maintain the clear coat\u2019s integrity in the face of environmental exposure.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Use Body Filler",
        "content": "Understanding Body Filler Types\n\nPolyester fillers, commonly known as Bondo, are popular for their versatility. They are suitable for repairing a range of surfaces, including metal, fiberglass, and wood. Bondo on a car can be used for both small dents and larger repairs.\nEpoxy fillers are known for their durability and adhesion properties. They are an excellent choice for repairs in areas prone to high levels of moisture, such as the undercarriage. Epoxy fillers are often recommended for professional or heavy-duty applications.\nLightweight putties are similar to common polyester fillers but are lighter-weight, making them easier to sand and shape.\nPlastic body fillers are meant to adhere to surfaces like bumpers, mirrors, and trim where normal fillers won\u2019t stick properly.\n\nConsider the specific requirements of your project when selecting a body filler. If you need a quick and easy solution for minor dents, polyester fillers like Bondo are a reliable choice. For more demanding repairs or projects exposed to harsh conditions, epoxy fillers might be the better option. Of course, repairs to plastic will require a plastic filler. AutoZone\u2019s knowledgeable staff can assist you in choosing the right filler for your unique project.\n\nPreparation for Body Filler Application\n\nAchieving a flawless finish with body filler starts with proper surface preparation. Begin by thoroughly cleaning the repair area, removing any rust, dirt, or loose paint. Use a degreaser to ensure a clean, oil-free surface. Sand the area around the repair to create a rough surface for better filler adhesion.\nTo prepare for the application of body filler, gather the necessary tools and materials. This includes:\n\nSandpaper of varying grits\nA spreader or applicator\nA mixing board\nBody filler\nGloves and eye protection\nA mask\n\nPark your vehicle in an area that\u2019s a comfortable temperature, out of the sun, and let the vehicle acclimatize before applying your product.\n\nApplication Techniques for a Professional Finish\n\nApplying the body filler might not seem that difficult, but it\u2019s a much more precise job than you think. An improper mix could set up too quickly or not fast enough. A thick application can droop and run, and ridges can make it difficult and time-consuming to sand. Here are some techniques to follow.\n\nProper Mixing of Body Filler\n\nFollow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for mixing body filler. In many cases, there will be a template included to indicate how much product to mix with the activator. Ensure that the filler is thoroughly and evenly mixed to achieve the best results.\nUse a clean mixing board and the recommended ratio of filler and hardener. Working quickly but efficiently during this step is crucial, as body fillers can cure rapidly.\n\nApplying Filler to Various Surfaces\n\nApply the mixed body filler to the repair area using a spreader or applicator. Work in small sections, gradually building up the filler to the desired thickness. Multiple thin applications often yield better results than one thick application.\nFeather the edges to blend the filler seamlessly with the surrounding surface. Pay attention to contours and curves, adapting your application technique to different surface shapes. If the putty is getting too firm, discard it and mix a new batch.\nOnce applied, make sure you let it set for the full time indicated on the product. Otherwise, the next step will be harder to complete.\n\nSanding and Shaping for Perfection\n\nSanding is a critical step in achieving a smooth and even surface. Start with coarse-grit sandpaper to shape the filler and gradually progress to finer grits for a polished finish. Use long, even strokes, and be mindful of the pressure applied. Sanding between applications may be necessary for multi-layer repairs.\nIf you have a large surface to work on, consider getting a power sander. Maintain light pressure and move in circles rather than straight lines.\nAchieving the desired shape requires attention to detail. Use the contours of the vehicle as a guide, and periodically step back to assess your progress. Feather the edges of the filler to create a seamless transition between the repaired area and the original surface. Precision and patience are key to achieving a professional finish.\n\nFinishing Touches and Painting\n\nBefore painting, apply a high-quality automotive primer to the repaired area. The primer ensures the paint will adhere properly to the paint and provides additional protection. AutoZone offers a range of primers suitable for different applications. Consult with our associates to find the right primer for your project.\n\nPainting Over Body Filler: Dos and Don\u2019ts\n\nWhen painting over body filler, follow best practices to ensure a long-lasting and aesthetically pleasing finish.\n\nMatch the paint color precisely, using the paint code found on your vehicle. Even a minor difference will be very noticeable.\nApply paint in thin, even coats.\u00a0\nAllow each coat to dry completely before applying the next.\n\nMastering how to use body filler is a valuable skill for DIY auto enthusiasts. At your local AutoZone, you\u2019ll find all of the body repair products you need to complete the job like a pro.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Types of Car Spray Paint\n\nCar spray paint comes in various types, each with its own set of characteristics:\n\nAcrylic spray paint. Known for its versatility and ease of use, acrylic lacquer spray paint is suitable for a wide range of car painting projects. It dries quickly and offers good coverage.\nEnamel spray paint. Enamel paints are highly durable and provide a glossy finish. They are excellent for touch-ups and for painting car parts that are exposed to harsh conditions.\nBasecoat and clearcoat system. This system includes a basecoat color layer and a clearcoat for added protection and shine. It\u2019s commonly used for full-body car painting.\nPrimer. These sprays are used to prepare the surface before applying the topcoat. Primers improve adhesion and help achieve a smoother finish.\n\nBut not all spray paints are created equal. Although you might find the same color in different types, there are distinct differences between them.\nAcrylic paints are versatile, quick-drying, and provide good coverage. They aren\u2019t as durable as other types, though, so you may need to repaint at some point. They\u2019re ideal for touch-ups, small DIY projects, and areas with minimal wear.\nEnamel spray paint is more durable, has a nice glossy finish, and is suitable for tough conditions. The trade-off is that it has a longer drying time and there may be limited color options. This type is perfect for parts exposed to harsh conditions, such as wheels and undercarriage components.\nBasecoat/clearcoat systems provides a professional finish and typically color match your factory paint very well. However,\u00a0 it requires more complex application, and it\u2019s a longer process tha requires more equipment. It\u2019s best suited for full-body car painting projects when you want a professional, glossy finish.\nPrimer doesn\u2019t really compare with the others as it\u2019s intended solely to improve adhesion, prevent rust, and fill small defects. It\u2019s a prep product that\u2019s often used in conjunction with the others and won\u2019t match color at all.\n\nTop Car Spray Paint Brands\n\nDupli-Color\n\nDupli-Color offers a wide range of automotive paints known for their quality and reliability. Their product lines include various paint types and color options, but their main focus is on acrylics. One of the largest benefits is the vast color-matched paint options so you get a seamless finish on your vehicle.\n\nRust-Oleum\n\nRust-Oleum is a trusted brand with a reputation for durable and long-lasting paints. They offer enamel and acrylic lacquer automotive paints that are fast-drying and apply quite evenly. There are even paints intended specifically for plastic, like for a bumper repair.\n\nRust-Oleum\n\nBuy Now \n\nSeymour\n\nSeymour manufactures paints that are specifically intended for high-heat surfaces.

They dry quickly, and the enamel paint resists fading in the sun too.\n\nU-Pol\n\nBuy Now \n\nHow to Choose the Right Car Spray Paint\n\nAgain, not every paint product will be right for your application. When selecting the right car spray paint, consider the following factors:\n\nMatching paint colors and finishes. Ensure the spray paint color matches your car\u2019s original color. You can find the color code on your vehicle\u2019s VIN plate or in the owner\u2019s manual. Also, consider the desired finish, such as glossy or matte.\nSurface compatibility. Check if the spray paint is suitable for the type of surface you plan to paint, whether it\u2019s metal, plastic, or another material.\nProject size. Determine the size and complexity of your project. For small touch-ups, acrylic or enamel spray paint may suffice, while full-body painting projects may benefit from a basecoat/clearcoat system.\nApplication method. Consider your level of experience and the tools available. Some spray paints may require specialized equipment, while others are designed for DIY use.\n\nFortunately, AutoZone carries the painting products you need to keep your car looking great.

        "title": "How to Spray Paint Your Car",
        "content": "Getting Started\n\nBefore you begin, it\u2019s crucial to prioritize safety. Here are some precautions to keep in mind:\n\nVentilation. Ensure you work in a well-ventilated area to disperse fumes and prevent inhalation of harmful chemicals. Plenty of substances contain VOCs and other substances that could make you sick long after the job is done.\nProtective gear. Invest in safety gear such as a respirator mask, safety glasses, gloves, and a full-body coverall to shield yourself from paint and chemicals.\nFire safety. Keep a fire extinguisher nearby, as some paints are flammable.\n\nAfter ensuring your work area is prepped and you have the safety gear in place, it\u2019s time to make sure you have all of your materials. They include:\n\nAutomotive paint. Choose the appropriate type and color of automotive paint for your car. Other types of paint like rattle can spray paints won\u2019t do a good job.\nPrimer. An automotive primer is essential for a smooth finish.\nClear coat. This protective layer adds gloss and durability.\nSpray gun. Invest in a high-quality spray gun for professional results.\nSandpaper and sanding blocks. Different grits for sanding and smoothing surfaces.\nMasking tape and plastic sheeting. For masking off areas you don\u2019t want to paint.\nTack cloth. To remove dust and debris from the car\u2019s surface.\nRespirator mask. For protection against fumes.\nSafety glasses, gloves, and coveralls. Personal protective equipment is a must.\nClean rags. For wiping down surfaces.\nClean water and soap. To clean the car thoroughly.\n\nPreparing Your Car\n\nProper surface preparation is the key to a successful paint job. For the sake of this article, let\u2019s assume that any body damage and dents have already been repaired.\n\nWash the car. Use soap and water to remove dirt, grease, and old wax. Rinse thoroughly.\nSanding. Start with a coarse grit, around 400, to remove imperfections and old paint. Gradually work your way to finer grit sandpaper like 800 to 1,500 for a smoother surface that won\u2019t show sanding marks.\nRemove rust. Address any rust spots by sanding them down to bare metal and applying a rust inhibitor.\n\nThen, before you start spraying, you need to make sure you won\u2019t be laying paint on surfaces that you don\u2019t want coated. Use masking tape and plastic sheeting to cover windows, trim, tires, and any areas you want to protect from overspray.\n\nSpray Painting Techniques\n\nSelecting the right paint is crucial. Look on the door placard, the label under the hood, or consult your car\u2019s manufacturer for the exact paint code if you\u2019re doing a color match, and consider factors like weather resistance and color options.\nSpray painting for cars is a precise job, and it\u2019s best to practice on a different surface before spraying your car. Get comfortable before laying any paint on your car. It allows you the opportunity to set the recommended air pressure for your paint gun.\nOne of the techniques to use is overlapping strokes. Keep the gun moving in a consistent, overlapping pattern for even coverage.\nOnce you\u2019re ready to begin, work in these three stages:\n\nApply primer. Use even strokes to apply a thin coat of primer, allowing it to dry completely before sanding lightly. Then, blow it off and remove remaining dust using tack cloth.\nApply the base coat. Apply multiple thin layers of base coat, allowing each layer to dry before applying the next.\nApply the clear coat. Apply clear coat in thin, even layers to protect the paint and add a glossy finish.\n\nEach product will have recommendations for how many coats to lay down, along with drying times before re-applying. Follow these strictly for the best results.\n\nTroubleshooting and Tips\n\nIt might not work out perfectly every time, especially for a beginner. If you have runs in the paint, gently sand the run with a fine-grit sandpaper and apply more paint if necessary. Remove drips with a scraper or razor blade before they dry.\nIt\u2019s essential to keep your workspace clean and free from dust and debris. Use a tack cloth to remove any dust particles from the car\u2019s surface before painting.\nSince the paint is aerosolized, there\u2019s always potential for overspray. Maintain a consistent distance from the car\u2019s surface to control overspray. And if you\u2019re working outside,avoid painting on windy days to prevent overspray drift. As well, paint in mild temperaturese as extreme heat or cold can affect the paint\u2019s drying time and finish.\n\nFinishing Touches\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to show off the new paint job as soon as you\u2019re done, but you could be risking damage. Allow the paint to dry and cure according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For the best results, use a polishing compound to remove imperfections and enhance the shine.\nOnce the paint is fully cured, carefully remove masking tape and reassemble any parts you removed.\nBy following these steps and taking your time, you can achieve a professional-quality paint job on your car. Remember that practice makes perfect, so don\u2019t be discouraged if your first attempt isn\u2019t flawless.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Find the Right Touch Up Paint Code For Your Car",
        "content": "What\u2019s a paint code?\n\nWhen your vehicle was manufactured, it was coated with an extremely precise paint color from the carmaker. From one vehicle that rolls off the assembly line to another, and even one model year to another, the color remains consistent. That color is represented by a paint code, identifying it as the right hue to match your car.\nIf you use any other color than one with the same paint code, it\u2019s almost a guarantee that it will be noticeable. Even among black cars, there are dozens of variations including metal flake content and underlying tones. Always use a paint code for touch up paint or your results won\u2019t be quite what you expect.\n\nHow to find your car\u2019s paint code\n\nWhen you need paint to repair a small area on your vehicle, purchase it according to the paint code. You\u2019ll find paint codes for cars in a couple of locations on your car, and there are ways to find it otherwise too.\u00a0\n\nDriver\u2019s door label\nWhen you open the driver\u2019s door, a rectangular label is affixed either to the door edge or the B pillar. Along with the VIN and important information like GVWR, it often has the vehicle paint code printed on it. Look for an abbreviation like \u2018EXT PNT\u2019 or an identifier like \u2018BODY COLOR CODE\u2019, although sometimes the paint code isn\u2019t so clearly identified. It can be between two and five digits.\n\nUnderhood label\nFor some cars, a label under the hood may contain paint code information too. This label could either be a sticker or riveted placard, and the details vary by make. Again, the color code might be clearly identified or it might have an abbreviation like \u2018CC\u2019, but in other cases, the code is simply stamped or printed with no other marks to indicate what it is.\u00a0\nThis label can be difficult to read on some older cars since age and heat can deteriorate the printing on it. Or, grease and paint might be covering it.\n\nWindow sticker\nIf you\u2019ve purchased your vehicle new, the Monroney sticker, or window sticker, might\u2019ve been saved and stored with your owner\u2019s manual. This sticker has your vehicle build information on it, and the paint code is often part of that info, but most often it has the paint color description instead.\u00a0\n\nAdditional Automotive Paint Resources\n\nHow to match your car\u2019s paint\n\nOr, if you know the color description rather than the paint code, you can search that way. While it leaves room for error, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll come across the correct variation.\u00a0\n\nWhat to do when you can\u2019t find the right touch up paint\n\nSome colors, especially on classic and vintage cars, are no longer manufactured in off-the-shelf touch-up paint pens. If that\u2019s true for your vehicle, you aren\u2019t out of luck \u2013 it just takes an extra step. You might need to take a part off of your car and bring it to an automotive paint supplier for them to color match it, just like you\u2019d do with paint for your home. Some discontinued paint codes might actually match a color another manufacturer uses, or it might have been assigned a different, more current code.\u00a0\nBut if your code of car touch up paint doesn\u2019t exist, it can be custom mixed by an automotive paint supplier too. It might be costly, and the results often aren\u2019t guaranteed.\u00a0\nOr, if an exact match isn\u2019t important to you and you\u2019re more interested in making sure the metal doesn\u2019t rust underneath, choose a universal touch up paint color and get the job done.\nLooking for touch up paint to match your car?

        "title": "How to Stop Rust on a Car",
        "content": "Understanding Rust Formation\n\nYou\u2019ve no doubt seen vehicles on the road where the rust seems more prevalent than the actual body color. Once rust starts, it can spread quickly and take over the whole car. There are many ways this unwanted invader attacks a vehicle, and whether it happens in the winter or summer, it all starts with water. Rust formation occurs when metal surfaces are exposed to moisture and oxygen, and salt can act as an accelerator. The combination of these elements leads to a chemical reaction known as oxidation, which results in the breakdown of metal.\nIt\u2019s important to be aware of common areas prone to rust, such as the undercarriage, wheel wells, door edges, and trunk lid \u2013 every nook, cranny, crease, or cavity of your car\u2019s body or undercarriage that isn\u2019t able to dry quickly.\u00a0 Additionally, environmental factors like high humidity, road salt, and exposure to harsh weather conditions can accelerate rust formation. Even exposure to the sun\u2019s rays can contribute to rusting.\n\nPreventive Maintenance Tips\n\nPreventing rust starts with regular maintenance and protective measures. Here are some key tips to keep your car rust-free.\n\nRegular washing and waxing \u2013 Clean your car regularly to remove dirt, salt, and other corrosive substances. Apply a high-quality automotive wax to create a protective barrier against moisture.\u00a0\nTouch up scratches \u2013 If the paint layer is broken, moisture can get underneath and form rust. Immediately touch up any scratches or paint chips to prevent it.\nLimit environmental exposure \u2013 If possible, park your car in a garage or under a car cover to avoid constant exposure to rain, snow, and UV rays.\nRust inhibitor sprays \u2013 Utilize rust inhibitor sprays or penetrating oils to protect vulnerable areas of your car. These products help displace moisture and create a barrier against rust formation.\nProtective coatings for vulnerable areas \u2013 Apply protective coatings, such as rubberized undercoatings or rust-resistant paints, to susceptible areas like the undercarriage and wheel wells. These coatings provide an extra layer of protection against rust-causing elements.\n\nDIY Rust Removal Techniques\n\nIf rust has already formed on your car, it\u2019s crucial to address it promptly to prevent further damage. Here are some general methods for rust removal:\n\nFor surface rust, sand the affected area to remove the rust. Afterward, apply a primer and matching paint to restore the finish, followed by a clear coat. This method is effective for small rust spots or minor surface corrosion.\nRust converters are chemicals that convert rust into a stable compound and provide a protective coating. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions when using rust converters to ensure safe and effective results.\nRust dissolvers contain acids that break down rust, making it easier to remove. These solutions can be applied to heavily rusted areas but should be used with caution and in well-ventilated areas.\n\nPlease note that rust removal techniques may vary depending on the severity of the rust and your car\u2019s specific needs. Consult with a professional if you\u2019re unsure about the best approach for your situation.\n\nLong-Term Maintenance Strategies\n\nPreventing rust is an ongoing process. Here are some long-term maintenance strategies to keep your car protected:\n\nInspect your vehicle regularly for any signs of rust or vulnerable areas. If you notice any new rust spots, address them promptly by sanding, priming, and repainting the affected area.\nWhen replacing or repairing parts of your car, opt for high-quality materials that are resistant to corrosion. Stainless steel or galvanized parts are excellent choices for areas prone to rust.\nDuring winter, when road salt is commonly used, take extra precautions to protect your car. Wash your vehicle frequently to remove salt residue, and consider applying a protective coating or wax before the winter season.\nInstall a rust module. These electronic devices apply a mild charge to your car\u2019s chassis, repelling rust. They do require maintenance though, as the sacrificial leads can and will corrode.\n\nBy implementing these preventive measures and maintenance strategies, you can significantly reduce the risk of rust formation and keep your car looking its best. Remember, rust prevention is a continuous effort. Regular maintenance, protective measures, and prompt action are key to preserving your car\u2019s appearance and structural integrity.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Paintless Dent Removal: Does It Work?",
        "content": "What is Paintless Dent Removal?\n\nAn alternative to traditional restoration, which usually involves body work and repainting, paintless dent removal is a much less invasive way of removing evidence of bumps and dents. While it almost always takes less time than body work, paintless dent removal can still require a lot of prep-work and careful consideration by the person doing the repairs.\nBeing able to ease the metal back into shape means that the different angles and contours of the dent need to be identified and understood. Experienced paintless dent repairers can do this by using special tools and lighting to figure out exactly what is going on with the damaged area. Once the area has been mapped out, the repairer will need to apply a variety of different types of pressure to gradually ease the dented metal back into shape. Since dents have to be smoothed out from behind, interior paneling may need to be removed from the car during the process and put back in place when the repairs are done, but no permanent replacements should have to occur.\n\nCan You Do Your Own Paintless Dent Removal?\n\nIt can be more than a little disconcerting to watch someone else hammer and put pressure on an already-damaged part of your vehicle, but in the case of paintless dent removal, an experienced hand is usually best. While you can learn to do paintless dent removal yourself, the number of tools required and the importance of precision in the task mean that it is usually a better option to go to someone who really knows what they\u2019re doing.  The amount of money it costs to hire professionals for paintless dent repair cost can be worth it if it means the job is done as well as possible from the start.\n\nHow Much Does Paintless Dent Removal Cost?\n\nOne of the biggest factors in your decision to repair a dent can be how much it will cost you. Since dents are generally only cosmetic, it can be tempting to simply leave them alone and move on. However, small dent repair costs are usually low and it can be worthwhile to spring some money on them. While a lot can depend on the specifics of the damage, such as how big the dent is and where it\u2019s located, it\u2019s usually safe to safe that paintless dent removal can be a much cheaper option than traditional restoration. It can also be worth keeping in mind that while repainting often lowers the resale value of your vehicle, paintless repair, when done well, shouldn\u2019t make a noticeable impact on how much money you can get for the car later.\nAs far as the exact cost of paintless dent repair goes, you should expect it to be somewhere in the range of $50-$400. Small dents, such as those on the doors tend to be cheaper than larger areas of damage, but paintless repair should remain affordable even in cases of large collision damage.\n\nWill Paintless Dent Removal Work on Your Car?\n\nMost of the time, small dents can be successfully repaired without extensive body work. The exceptions can be for very large areas of damage or damage where the metal has been stretched too far beyond its original shape.\nIf the damage is extensive, or if there are cracks in the paint or stretching in the metal, you may be safer going for professional body work as a solution. Professional body work is usually more expensive and time-consuming, but it can sometimes be a better option in extreme cases. Rather than pushing the metal back into shape, traditional body work and repair generally involves putting a filler in the dent and repainting over it.\nA few tell-tale signs that paint will need to be redone can be:\n\nBubbling \nChipping \nCreasing \nPeeling \n\nIf these problems exist you will likely be better off taking the route of traditional dent repair instead of trying to solve the issue through paintless repair.\n\nPaintless Repair Vs. Traditional Repair\n\nBefore committing to traditional dent removal instead of paintless dent removal, it can be important to note that not only is traditional removal more of a hassle, but it may not hold up as well as paintless dent repair in the long run. Repainting and body repairs may also lower the overall value of your vehicle should you decide to sell it in the future.\nAnother interesting benefit of paintless repair can be that it is more environmentally friendly than traditional repair, as none of the chemicals that would be released into the air during repainting are needed. While this may not be the biggest selling point of paintless repair, it is another good thing to keep in mind.\n\nRepairing Dents\n\nWhile not the most pressing of repairs, dents are something you should fix at one point or another to keep your vehicle looking its best. If the dents are small and there is no serious creasing in the existing paint, paintless dent removal should be a great way to remove most evidence of the damage while saving yourself a lot of time and money. Paintless removal is a permanent solution to denting that should make it so your car looks as if the damage never occurred in the first place. Consider it a great all-around option for any situation in which the paint remains intact and the metal simply needs to be pressed back into shape.",

        "title": "How to Get Tar, Sap, Bugs, and Other Caked-on Dirt Off Your Car's Paint",
        "content": "Clean it Up\u00a0When You See It\n\nProbably the most salient advice for big messes is to keep on top of your car\u2019s washing. If you notice any sort of an issue, it\u2019s better to take care of it right away as opposed to letting it harden on your vehicle. Additionally, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so regularly washing your car should become part of your weekly routine. With a little bit of maintenance, you may find that major clean-up jobs can be avoided.\nThe best way to tackle spot cleans between\u00a0regular car washings\u00a0is to obtain a microfiber towel, some mild car wash, and water. With all of this in hand, you can simply go after problem spots as soon as you notice them. Again, the longer you wait, the more elbow grease it requires to remove in the long run.\n\nGiving Asphalt, Tar, and Pitch\u00a0the Boot\n\nSome of the most frustrating substances to try and remove from your car are sticky ones. Asphalt, tar, bugs, and tree pitch can give you a real headache. Often, the soap and water treatment is not enough to really remove these annoyances from your vehicle.\nThankfully, there are specific products that can help you restore your vehicle to its original luster. In order to remove stubborn sticky debris, you first want to drive your vehicle into the shade or somewhere cool, and let your vehicle cool down. If your vehicle is hot when you apply the product, it either hardens or evaporates too quickly.\nWhile traditional Bar and Tar remover are often the best items for this job, using the \u201cthousands of uses\u201d traditional WD-40 or other penetrating oil, or even Goo-Gone will also remove plenty of super-stubborn contaminants from the paint. For paint that\u2019s been contaminated with microscopic things you can feel on a freshly washed car, using a Clay Bar is by far the industry standard for getting a nice, smooth, contaminant free finish that is ready for waxing. It\u2019s highly recommended that you Clay Bar your car any time before you are applying wax.\n\nHow to Remove Sticky Substances from Your Car\n\n1. Inspect Your Vehicle\n\nAfter your car has cooled off and is completely dry, you can then inspect the vehicle for any sticky messes. In terms of asphalt, you\u2019ll find it most often on your mud flaps, rocker panels, doors, and hub caps. Bugs and tree pitch can be plastered across your headlights, hood, and grille. Of course, any of these annoyances can be found anywhere, but these are the most common locations.\n\n2. Spray the Mess\n\nWhen you find a sticky mess, reach for a bug-and-tar remover first. You can spray the remover on the areas that have the mess, and let it sit for at least five minutes. A good practice when using an automated car-wash is to spray the front of the vehicle and mirrors with bug and tar remover about 5 minutes before entering. This will help the car wash break up the bugs and mess that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have come off.\n\n3. Use a Towel to Remove Debris\n\nOnce the product has set for an appropriate amount of time, you can then use a microfiber towel to remove the mess by rubbing it in a circular motion. This should remove the debris. In the event that you were trying to remove mess from a difficult location, like your car\u2019s grille, you can spray the product into the towel and work it along the surface that way.\nIf you are dealing with a stubborn sticky mess, you can also try using a dabbing maneuver to loosen it. You want to avoid abrasive materials like scrubbing pads or steel wool, as these can damage the finish of your vehicle.\n\n4. Wash Your Car\n\nOnce the mess is removed, you can then go ahead and wash your car like normal to return it to its original state.\n\nHow to Remove Highway Paint / Other Paint\n\nOne of the more frustrating risks of driving through construction zones is discovering highway paint splattered all across the bottom of your vehicle. To this end, if you have to drive through a construction zone, make sure that you keep a sharp eye on your rocker panels, doors, wheel wells, and tires. It\u2019s easy to miss splatters of highway paint, and the quicker you are able to remove this menace from your car, the better.\nHowever, if you do discover splatters of any kind of paint that are dried on your vehicle, there are many steps you can take to remove it. First, you should always try going through a traditional car wash or putting some elbow grease in on your own driveway with mild car soap and water.\nIf this fails to remove the paint, go ahead and reach for your bug-and-tar remover and use the same steps outlined previously to remove the paint. You may also want to add more of the remover to your microfiber towel, and try and buff out the paint in a circular motion. It is very likely that this is going to take a good amount of time to get all the paint off, so be patient.\nIf this fails to work, usually the best option for removing paint, but requires extreme caution, is Lacquer Thinner. Most modern paint jobs are a basecoat/clearcoat finish, and once hardened, is resistant to solvent like Lacquer Thinner in small doses. The best method is to test your finish in an inconspicuous area to be sure the Lacquer Thinner won\u2019t damage it. In most cases, it will not, and to apply, simply splash a little Lacquer Thinner onto a microfiber or polishing towel and gently rub the area that has the paint you wish to remove. You will notice the Lacquer Thinner will dissolve the paint quickly. It will also strip any wax off of the finish, so after removal, you will need to re-wax / polish the area that once had paint on it, but usually this is the quickest and easiest way to remove paint that otherwise will not come off.\nIf this still fails to work, you may wish to reach for a polishing compound. Polishing compounds are slightly abrasive and can help you remove paint without damaging the surface of your car.\nTo use a polishing compound, apply to either an application pad by hand, or use a mechanical buffer / compound over the area. Follow up with wax.\nWith these car wash tips and tricks in mind, you can ensure that your summer drives remain carefree and, ultimately, clean.",

        "content": "What is a\u00a0car paint touch up?\n\nGet started with\u00a0the right supplies\nPerforming one of these repairs is easy enough, but it does require some basic research and a few supplies. A variety of paint types are available, but pens are ideal for small damaged areas. However, you may need to use another option if you\u2019re dealing with a larger surface area.\nDepending on how deep the damage is and whether there\u2019s any rust, you\u2019ll need a few supplies. Here\u2019s a complete list of what you\u2019ll need:\nThe right color paintClear coat paintRubbing compoundSandpaper and a sanding block (you\u2019ll need coarser sandpaper if you have rust)A cotton cloth\n\nHow to Touch Up Your Car\u2019s Paint Job\n\n1. Wash and Wax Your Vehicle\n\nWash and dry the vehicle. Paints and primers always need a good, clean surface to adhere to, and touch up paint is much the same. Use wax and grease remover over the spots to be repaired, or the area can be finally cleaned with glass cleaner to insure there is no grease, oil, or contaminants on the paint in the touched up area.\n\n2. Find a Nice, Shady Spot\n\nMove the vehicle to a shaded area. You want to apply the paint in a mild climate\u2014don\u2019t work in direct sunlight or when the temperature is near freezing.\n\n3. Get the Right Paint for Your Ride\n\nFind the paint code for your car. This number will tell you what color paint you need to exactly match the vehicle\u2019s paint job. Refer to this when you\u2019re purchasing the paint.\n\n4. Prepare the Damaged Area\n\nRemove any flaking paint around the area. If there\u2019s rust, scratches that have cut down to the metal, or larger paint chips, use heavy sandpaper to treat the damaged area and remove any dust with a clean rag. Then apply rubbing compound to smooth the area you\u2019re treating.\n\n5. Paint the Area with Multiple Coats\n\nApply the paint. Follow the directions listed on the product you\u2019ve purchased. Remember to give it time to dry between coats. Sand the area again to ensure that the new paint is flush against the old paint. Repeat this step as needed until the color is correct and the paint is smooth across the entire area.\n\n6. Finish with Clear Coat\n\nNext, you can choose to then finish the touched up area with clear coat touch up or extra protection. You can then wet sand / buff the area and blend the touched up area into the rest of the cars finish for a much-less noticeable look. To do this, start with 1200 grit wet sanding paper and very gently wet sand the touched up area, making sure not to cut into the surrounding finish. Next, use 2000, and finish off by buffing the area with polishing compound and a DA rotary buffer.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your car needs a final cleaning over the treated area. Remember to be patient and sand as much as needed to ensure that the new paint matches the body as closely as possible. You can also try practicing on some scrap metal first. After you\u2019ve finished, apply a fresh coat of wax for a consistent shine across the entire vehicle.",

The main thing to remember is that if you are dealing with bolt holes around the engine, you want to be very careful about metal shavings getting into the intake manifold. This can end up being an expensive headache if it happens. Best practice here is to avoid using a cutting tap which will remove metal. In these very sensitive environments, you want to consider using a forming or a chasing tap instead. Rather than cutting away metal, these taps will simply reform it.\n\nHow to Fix a Stripped Bolt Hole in Metal\n\nIf you want to know how to fix stripped threads, it\u2019s important to understand what the problem is and how severe it is. In the event that the threads are not entirely destroyed but simply not pronounced enough to grip the bolts, you may be able to salvage the situation with a thread chasing tap. This is the easier of the two options to fix stripped bolt holes, given that the thread chaser will carve away rust and help redefine the threads, but it will not remove or reform the metal. This is very useful in areas around the engine, where manifold intake could be a problem with metal fillings. In reality, this is more like cleaning out the threads rather than entirely replacing them, and you probably always want to try a chaser before moving on to a tap that carves metal out of the hole.\nGenerally speaking, you will not have a difficult time finding a thread chaser if you need it in a standard size.\nSome people will indeed use thread carving taps to clean their threads and not a chaser; however, if you do this you run a higher risk of accidentally widening the bolt hole, which can loosen the grip, causing obvious problems. In sum, if you do have anything resembling a thread left in the bolt hole, it\u2019s wiser to use a thread chasing tap. It is always best to try the easiest solution first.\nHowever, in some situations the damage to the threads is too much for a thread chaser to repair. The complete repair for stripped threads is to use a coil-type thread insert. These inserts will give the bolt hole completely new threads which accept the size of the original bolt. In order to use inserts, you must drill the damaged holes slightly larger so that it can take the thread insert.\nThis guide will focus on how to use coil type thread inserts to revitalize a completely stripped bolt hole:\n\nHow To Fix A Stripped Screw Thread With Inserts\n\n1. Remove The Bolt\n\nThe first thing you will need to do is remove the bolt. If the hole is completely stripped and you cannot get enough grip to remove the bolt, you will need to drill into the center of the bolt and have a bolt extractor on hand to remove it.\n\n2. Clean The Remaining Threads\n\nOnce you have removed the bolt, use a clean rag, some compressed air, and penetrating oil to cleanse the remaining threads. If you have a Shop-Vac, it can be very helpful for this process.\n\n3. Find The Right Drill Size\n\nExamine the drill size that is listed on your coil-type thread insert\u2019s package, and make sure that you can drill the bolt-hole to this width. A drill block will help you ensure that the hole you are drilling remains straight. You need to use cutting oil to cover the tap, and occasionally back it up to clear out fillings which can become impacted if this is not done. (Remember that if you are working in a sensitive part of the car where metal shavings can cause major damage that you want to use a forming tap instead.)\n\n4. Screw The Thread Insert Onto The Installation Tool\n\nNext, take the thread insert and screw it entirely into the installation tool. There will be a tab on the bottom of the thread insert, and this will be locked on to the end of the tool if installed properly.\n\n5. SCREW IN THE THREAD INSERT\n\nAt this point, the thread insert should be covered with a thread-locking compound, so that you can screw it into the new threads. At this point, you should make sure that the thread insert is entirely flush with the surface. Needle nose pliers will be helpful to help you remove the tab on the coil.\n\nAfter all of this, you should be able to easily replace the bolt into its new hole. It\u2019s important to understand how to replace a stripped bolt hole, particularly if you work with cars frequently,\u00a0specifically\u00a0if you\u00a0work with older cars. Like with many aspects of mechanics, the more you do it the better you will get. Many seasoned mechanics can completely replace female threads in less than 10 minutes.",

        "content": "How to Fix a Dent in a Car\n\n1. Clean the Car and Remove Any Residue\n\nClean the vehicle with soap and water, followed by a residue remover.\u202f3M Adhesive Remover\u202fis a great product for this step. This is important as any contaminants (wax, bug residue, tar, dirt) remaining when sanding begins are ground into the surface and could compromise the adhesion of repair materials.\n\n2. Remove Paint from the Dented Area by Sanding\n\nUse a\u202fsanding block or random orbital sander\u202fwith an 80 grit abrasive sheet to remove all paint to approximately 2-5\u2033 around the dent.\n\n3. Start Working on the Dent with a Hammer, Mallet, or Dent Puller\n\nWhen repairing any dent it is best to remove as much of the dent as possible prior to filling with body filler. An assortment of\u202fhammers and mallets, dollies, picks, slide hammers and\u202fdent pullers\u202fmay be needed to perform this step. Always use appropriate eye and respiratory protection.\nOnce complete, keep in mind that plastic body fillers may adhere to bare metal, but it is not a good practice to do so, as metal can and will corrode and slowly release the bond from the plastic filler. This is why many repairs that are 5+ years old have plastic filler that has cracked. Once you feel your dent has been worked out, go back over your repair with sanding again and make sure the area is completely clean of any small rust pits, or other corrosion. Seal any bare metal with a good direct-to-metal primer and then provide a quick scuff of the primer with 220-300 grit sandpaper.\n\n4. Mix Bondo and Put Down the First Layer of Body Filler\n\nUsing proper techniques mix\u202fBondo\u00ae Body Filler\u202fusing the\u202fBondo\u00ae Plastic Spreader\u202ffrom 3M and apply mixed filler to the dent. The first layer should be applied with firm pressure to ensure good adhesion. Avoid over-application of filler as this just requires additional sanding. Work the filler out past the edges of the dent as you will need to shape and smooth the filler to blend into the surrounding panel. Let dry for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on temperature and humidity.\n\n5. Shape the Filler with a Sanding Block\n\nSelect a sanding block that is appropriate for the size of the repair and attach an 80 grit abrasive sheet. Rough shape/sand the repair area. ALWAYS keep your block flat to the surface. Avoid over-sanding with 80 grit or the finished repair area will be low. If low spots are detected, it may be necessary to apply more body filler and repeat this sanding step.\n\n6. Smooth Out the Filler with a 180 Grit Abrasive Sheet\n\nOnce satisfied with the rough shape of the repair, attach a 180 grit abrasive sheet to the sanding block and final shape the repair. After this step, the repair should be level and there should be no 80 grit scratches remaining. The body filler should also have a smooth featheredge all around the repair.\n\n7. Use the Sanding Block to Remove Paint and Scratches\n\nAttach a 180 grit abrasive sheet to the sanding block to featheredge the paint away from the body filler and remove all straight line scratches.\n\n8. Mix and Apply Glazing and Spot Putty\n\nMix\u202fBondo\u00ae Professional Glazing and Spot Putty\u202fand apply to the entire repair area overlapping the body filler and paint featheredge. Allow 15 minutes to dry, depending on the temperature and humidity.\n\n9. Sand the Repair Area Until Level\n\nApply a 180 grit abrasive sheet to the sanding block and sand the repair area until level. Remember to keep the block flat to the surface at all times and do not oversand.\n\n10. Remove Scratches from the Paint Around the Filler Area\n\nApply a 320 grit abrasive sheet to your sanding block and remove all straight line scratches from the paint around the filler area. At this point, you are ready to prime the area.\nPrime with several coats as the initial coats will soak into the filler. Continue to sand with 220-320 as you prime over the area / sand several times. Check carefully for small pinholes, deep sand scratches, and continue to prime/sand or fill with spot putty until you have a nice, smooth finish.\nCheck the transition between the body filler and surrounding area to make sure you are smooth and strait. A good practice here is to use a \u201cguide coat\u201d to do this. Take either flat black primer or paint, and gently mist a very thin top coat over the area. Now, take your 320 grit paper on a sanding block and gently work the block over the area with just a few sanding motions. Any low spots will immediately be revealed as the sand paper will remove the guide coat quickly, but won\u2019t hit the low spots. Once your area is smooth and level, you are ready to paint.",

        "title": "How to Remove Rust from a Car",
        "content": "What Damages are Caused by Rust?\n\nWhile rusting may seem like little more than a surface issue that affects your vehicle\u2019s appearance, it can actually be a serious problem that you should not ignore. Vehicle panels can rust from the outside in, or from the inside out, and once the metal is perforated, the only proper repair is a complete panel replacement or section replacement with new metal. If left unremedied, rust damage may eventually make its way to the frame of your car, creating serious structural damage that you may not be able to repair. If you want to keep using your car for as long as possible, then rust is something you can\u2019t ignore.\nLearn how to prevent rust from building up on your car\u2019s exterior.\n\nCan Rust be Removed?\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good to know that rust is not an issue you want to leave unaddressed, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how to get rid of rust on your vehicle. While almost any vehicle will eventually begin to rust as it ages, there are still ways to mitigate rusting in order to keep it from permanently damaging your car.\nRust restoration involves using abrasives and/or chemical rust removers to get rid of existing rust formation and stop it from spreading. In most cases, you will need to cover the surrounding, undamaged area with tape that won\u2019t damage your vehicle. Once you have used a rust removing product to get rid of the existing rust you will need to paint back over the restored area with primer. To keep rust from returning you should plan on putting on at least a few coats of primer. If the rusted area is too damaged, it may not be worth trying to restore and simply opt for panel replacement.\n\nHow to Remove Rust from Your Car\n\n1. Safety first\n\nThis project is going to require you to use safety googles. Always make sure your car is parked on a flat, level service. Do not wear loose fitting clothing or loose jewelry. Make sure you are working in a well-ventilated area. \n\n2. Tape it off\n\nIsolate the section you\u2019ll be working on, the same as if you were painting the vehicle. You\u2019ll want to make sure the non-rusted sections are protected. The rust job will put a lot of rust and paint particles in the air, so keep those off the healthy paint. Make sure to use real masking paper rather than newspaper.\n\n3. Remove paint and primer\n\nStart low and work your way up. We advise using a dual action sander, or a held-held grinder with a flap-disc for better control, starting with 60-80 grit. You\u2019ll want to sand through both the paint and the primer, and you may be able to take some rust off this way if it\u2019s loose on the metal. Understand that when sanding bubbles in the paint, many times the rust under it will have perforated the metal, and will show up as small pin holes in the metal. During this first step, most of the surface rust will also be removed.  \nShop our large selection of sanders and accessories for this step.\n\n4. Remove rust pits\n\nWhen repairing rusted sections of metal, it\u2019s important to understand that primer and paint cannot stick to rust, or at least, not for very long. It\u2019s important that all the metal you are working with is completely clean and free from rust. For this you\u2019ll need to use a\u202fgrinder or drill with a wire wheel, or a chemical compound such as \u201cmetal rescue,\u201d and make sure to wear eye protection and a dust mask. Use the wire wheel carefully to remove the rust that lives in the pits or below the surface area of the metal. Keep in mind that everything needs to be clean! If you use a chemical type rust remover, apply with a paint brush to concentrate your approach. Read the directions on the chemical bottle to determine the amount of time the chemical needs to work before re-cleaning the area. Chemical-based rust removers are good for removing rust and any microscopic remains.\n\n5. Prime the surface\n\nWhether you plan on simply priming the area for the time being, or actually refinishing a panel or section with the proper paint finish, the success of your job starts with a properly primed surface. Use an etching primer or primer that is suited for direct-metal contact. From here, you can choose to finish the panel with either body filler or surfacing primer, and then paint. Keep in mind that using body filler directly on bare metal that has not been sealed properly is not a good practice, and the repair will crack and fail over time.\n\nHow Difficult is the Rust Removal Process?\n\nSince the extent of rusting will be different in every case, it can be hard to gauge the exact amount of time you will need to spend to get rid of it. Sometimes it can be a simple task that only takes an hour or so, while in other cases serious repairs may need to take place over the course of a couple of days. \nMany times, the true extent of the damage will not be immediately revealed. For instance, an area that has 2 or 3 small rust bubbles, once stripped and cleaned may reveal several large rust holes in the panel, that needs to be replaced. You should try and pick a time to work on maintenance when the weather is good and allows you to work in an open area outside where you will get plenty of ventilation. You don\u2019t want to get caught in the rain in the middle of repairs, so it\u2019s worth tuning in to your local weather before getting started. Always assume worst case on the area you are working on, and have a plan for complete panel cut out / replacement if the repair turns out worse than expected.\nWhile not the easiest DIY car repair, rust removal is something that you can do on your own. If you\u2019ve never done similar maintenance before then you may want to find additional information and tutorials to help give you the know-how to get the job done right the first time.\n\nRestoring a Rusty Vehicle\n\nOnce you notice rust damage on your vehicle you shouldn\u2019t wait to get it fixed. It may not be the easiest repair process, but if you feel comfortable enough to try you should find that removing rust on your own is worth the work you put in. Doing the job yourself can be a great way to ensure that it is done with as much care as possible, and even with the products you will need to buy it can be a much cheaper option than hiring the work out.\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable making the repairs yourself, don\u2019t sweat it.

        "title": "Difference Between Horsepower and Torque",
        "content": "Introduction to Horsepower and Torque\n\nEngines are core components of vehicles, converting fuel into the power necessary to overcome inertia, tow and haul, and drive down the open road. Two primary measurements quantify this power: horsepower and torque.\nHorsepower is a unit that expresses the capability of an engine to do work over a period of time. The term was first coined by James Watt, a Scottish engineer who played a crucial role in the development of the steam engine. Watt\u2019s efforts to market his engine involved comparing its output against that of draft horses, which is an analogy that persists in the automotive industry today.\nTorque, on the other hand, is a rotational force produced by the engine. It\u2019s what you feel when you accelerate in your car, or when you apply your foot to the gas pedal to climb a hill. Torque is measured in pound-feet, or lb.-ft., in the United States \u2013 a unit that combines the force of pounds with the length of feet \u2013 representing a twisting force.\nTo better understand these terms, a brief look into the past might help. When the first vehicles emerged, engines were often rated purely on dimensions such as bore and stroke. However, it wasn\u2019t long before the industry looked for a more universal terminology, which is why the focus horsepower and, later, the emphasis on torque, as vehicles became more complex.\n\nHorsepower Unveiled\n\nWhen we speak of horsepower, we reference the engine\u2019s capacity to perform work. It\u2019s a measurement that\u2019s instrumental in comparing and selecting vehicles.\nOne horsepower, as determined by Watt, is equivalent to the work performed by a horse lifting 330 pounds of coal 100 feet into the air over a duration of one minute. In the context of vehicles, it equates to a specific amount of work completed in the same minute, so it\u2019s a measure of output that assures the engine keeps turning at a reliable pace.\nRevolution per minute, or RPM, is another crucial factor in the horsepower equation. An engine that can operate at high RPMs will often produce higher horsepower figures, reflecting an ability to maintain or increase its power output over time. This is particularly useful in achieving higher speeds or rapid acceleration.\n\nCracking the Torque Code\n\nTorque is the often misunderstood figure in the performance world. While it might not occupy the same level of public awareness as horsepower, it is equally \u2013 if not more \u2013 important in a car\u2019s day-to-day operation.\nImagine your car climbing a steep hill. The engine needs to apply a significant force to maintain speed and altitude. This force is torque, and engines that produce high torque figures at low RPM are very helpful in these scenarios. Trucks and many SUVs fit this bill, showcasing excellent low-end torque to handle heavy loads easily.\nWhile both are essential, the torque-versus-horsepower debate rages on among car enthusiasts. Some argue that torque is what matters in the real world, given its role in immediate acceleration and towing, while others favor horsepower for its role in momentum and higher top speeds. The truth, as always, lies in understanding the demands of the vehicle and, crucially, the driver\u2019s usage.\n\nHow Horsepower and Torque Affect Driving\n\nThe concepts of horsepower and torque have tangible impacts on your day-to-day driving experience, influencing everything from acceleration to maneuverability.\n\nAcceleration and speed \u2013 Horsepower dictates how fast your vehicle can get to peak torque and stay there, while torque is the force that lets your car achieve this acceleration. High horsepower and high torque are both required for a sports car to launch off the starting line and maintain acceleration.\nTowing and hauling capacity \u2013 When you haul a heavy load, you want an engine that can maintain high torque at low RPM, as this supports the steady, consistent power that hauls a trailer or a bed full of gravel. Horsepower also has a role here in preventing speed loss on inclines or in headwinds \u2014 helping to restore and conserve momentum.\n\nChoosing the Right Balance: Horsepower and Torque in Vehicle Selection\n\nAs consumers, the relationship between horsepower and torque is significant when choosing a vehicle. Considering your intended use and assessing the powertrain effectively can lead to a more satisfying driving experience.\nPersonal preferences and typical driving environments should help guide you. If you\u2019re a city driver primarily, you might prioritize low-end torque for zippy traffic maneuvers. On the other side, highway drivers may place greater value on horsepower for sustained speed.\nWhile it may seem counterintuitive, a balance between horsepower and torque can deliver excellent fuel efficiency. An engine that efficiently converts fuel into power, optimizing for the vehicle\u2019s weight and performance expectations, is what you\u2019re after.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How Superchargers Work for Cars",
        "content": "What is a Supercharger?\n\nTo grasp the concept of superchargers, start with the basics. So, what are superchargers? In simple terms, a supercharger is a mechanical device designed to force more air into your car\u2019s engine, allowing it to burn more fuel and generate extra power. Think of it as a power-boosting compressor.\nSuperchargers are often associated with high-performance cars because they can significantly enhance engine performance. They are particularly popular in the world of drag racing, where every ounce of extra power can make the difference between winning and losing.\nHowever, several carmakers have used superchargers on common street vehicles. When there\u2019s a horsepower and torque target but emissions standards are strict, using a forced-air induction system like a supercharger can help produce more power from a smaller engine size. This helps with reducing harmful tailpipe gases.\n\nThe Mechanics of Supercharging\n\nNow that we know what superchargers are let\u2019s delve into the mechanics behind it. At the heart of a supercharger lies a compressor, responsible for forcing additional air into the engine. This compressed air results in a more potent explosion during combustion, which translates to more power and torque.\nThe key takeaway here is that each type of supercharger has its unique advantages, making them suitable for different applications and preferences.\n\nAdvantages of Superchargers\n\nSuperchargers deliver a substantial power boost and improved torque, transforming your car into a beast on the road. Here are some of the primary benefits of superchargers:\n\nUnlike turbochargers, which can suffer from turbo lag, superchargers provide instant power when you hit the gas pedal. This responsiveness ensures that you have consistent power at your disposal.\u00a0\nTorque is essential for acceleration, and superchargers provide a substantial increase in torque across the RPM range. This means your car will feel more energetic in various driving situations.\u00a0\nSupercharged cars excel in various driving conditions, whether you\u2019re on the track, overtaking on the highway, or navigating through city traffic. The increased power and torque make for an exhilarating driving experience.\n\nTypes of Superchargers\n\nLet\u2019s explore the different types of superchargers in more detail:\nRoots superchargers are known for their distinctive appearance, with two rotating lobes meshing to move air. They\u2019re efficient at lower engine speeds, providing an instant power boost. Known for their distinctive whine and instant low-end power, Roots superchargers are a popular choice for muscle cars and drag racing enthusiasts.\nCentrifugal superchargers work similarly to a turbocharger, using a high-speed impeller to draw in and compress air. They excel at higher engine speeds and can be tuned for specific power gains. If you\u2019re after a more linear power curve, centrifugal superchargers might be your choice. They\u2019re adaptable and can be tuned for specific power gains, making them a versatile option for various applications.\nTwin-screw superchargers use two rotors that mesh together to compress air. They offer an excellent balance between instant low-end power and high-end performance. Twin-screw superchargers provide a balanced mix of low-end power and high-end performance. Their efficiency and instant power make them a favorite among car enthusiasts seeking both power and drivability.\nThe right supercharger for your vehicle will depend on your specific goals, driving style, and budget.\n\nInstallation and Maintenance\n\nIf your car was equipped with a supercharger from the factory, it can wear out or fail over the years. When you\u2019re installing a new one, it can restore your performance back to what you remember from when you first drove it. It\u2019s a delicate procedure, and any leaks can not just negate its performance, but it can cause a serious breakdown. If you\u2019re not comfortable with the process, it\u2019s best to have a trained mechanic do it for you.\nHow do you make the most out of a new supercharger for your car? Proper installation and maintenance are key to ensuring your supercharger performs at its best.\n\nRegular maintenance. Superchargers require periodic maintenance to keep them in top condition. This includes checking for leaks, changing the oil, and inspecting the drive belt.\nTuning. To maximize performance, tuning your supercharged engine is essential. Proper tuning ensures your car runs optimally and prevents any issues that might arise due to the increased power.\nQuality parts. Using quality supercharger components and accessories is crucial for reliability and performance. Brands like AutoZone offer a range of supercharger parts to keep your system in top shape.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

You can buy an entire performance exhaust system that does a better job of expelling exhaust gases while enabling greater airflow towards the engine. The faster the combustion chamber expels exhaust and spent gases, the faster a high-flow air filter can deliver more clean air. That adds up to a cleaner-burning engine and more horsepower and torque produced by the motor while using essentially the same amount of gas that a stock system would use.\n\nExhaust Options Abound\n\nOne of the most popular modifications is to swap out a restrictive stock muffler and exhaust. It\u2019s easy to get aftermarket truck mufflers and an exhaust that enhances airflow as well as the sound coming from the exhaust tips. Your truck can make more power with the addition of a high-flow exhaust and muffler. \nOnce you mount an aftermarket dual exhaust, you\u2019ll really hear your motor rev and run while on the streets or at your favorite off-roading location. You can do a simple muffler replacement or modify the entire exhaust for ideal results.\n\nImprove Stopping Power\n\nAfter completing a few performance truck mods, your brakes might need some help slowing things down. A wide range of aftermarket brake pads, calipers, rotors, and master cylinder improvements can greatly improve your truck\u2019s braking performance. Just switching from stock brake pads to performance brake pads with aftermarket rotors that channel away heat to fight warpage can give you a lot more stopping power. This is also true for aftermarket calipers that have more brake pistons to distribute stopping power to the pads and rotors more efficiently.\n\nLifting and Lowering Kits\n\nIf you want to do a lot of off-roading, you\u2019ll likely find a suspension lift kit to be highly beneficial. You can raise the truck by a couple of inches or more with a simple installation of a lift kit. These truck mods will give you more ground clearance to get over rocks and out of ruts. A taller truck will likely benefit from additional grab rails and steps to improve access. \nAlternatively, if you intend to mostly drive on the street and never see dirt, then a lowering kit might be in order. You can lower your truck\u2019s street profile while enabling easier access to the cabin. This can be helpful when you\u2019re loading large items in the bed. The suspension will still support the stock truckload and towing capacity, but you\u2019ll enjoy better access and a different general profile.",

        "title": "Everything You Need To Know About Aftermarket Gauges",
        "content": "Stock or OEM\u00a0Instrument Clusters\n\nRegardless of the type of vehicle you drive, your stock instrument cluster likely tells you some important information on a modern vehicle. That is, you probably have a speedometer and odometer. Your vehicle will also come with a fuel gauge, and usually a temperature and oil pressure gauge. This has not always been true, however. In the past, many vehicles only featured\u00a0warning lights\u00a0that illuminated when something went wrong. This was very typical of cars in the 60\u2019s to the late 80\u2019s, many of which people are restoring or modifying today.\nWhile OEM instrument clusters have come a long way in recent years, they are far from perfect. In fact, most gauges only tell you a bit of information about your vehicle and when vehicles are modified for performance, often times, more information is needed for the driver.\nFor this article, we will cover both aspects of aftermarket gauges, and how to choose them \u2013 both for newer vehicles and vintage.\n\nUpgrading Vintage Vehicles\n\nAs stated before, many vintage vehicles, especially those from 1960-1990, used lights to indicate low oil pressure, or high temperature, which left a lot to be desired. Because of this, many car enthusiasts added a \u201ctriple set\u201d of gauges where they could, which gave the car 3 gauges that weren\u2019t found on them at the time \u2013 Oil Pressure, Coolant Temperature, and a Voltage or Ammeter gauge. These same 3 gauges are still sold together today, and along with a Tachometer is usually all that\u2019s needed to upgrade a vehicle of this era and give the driver a full-scope on what\u2019s going on under the hood. \nWhen choosing aftermarket gauges for these vehicles, usually the most important question is whether or not you want these gauges to be mechanical, or electrical.\n\nMechanical and Electrical Gauges\n\nMechanical gauges have been around for nearly a century. These gauges have a direct connection to what\u2019s being measured. That is, a mechanical gauge may use an oil line that allows the gauge to directly measure oil pressure, or, a temperature probe that is screwed directly in a coolant passage. \nOn the other hand, Electric gauges function differently. Rather than featuring a direct connection, electric gauges operate using a sensor, or sender, which is screwed or plumbed directly into what\u2019s being measured. While this is essentially the same as the mechanical device, the difference is that this sensor then picks up and sends the information via an electrical wire to the gauge, where the gauge then displays the information. \nThe difference in your decision depends on a few factors. Keep in mind that on either gauge, the lighting to illuminate the gauge at night will always require an electrical signal and ground, so regardless of which design you use, you will still be doing electrical work. \nA Mechanical gauge will have less wires though, but you will need to run the materials through the firewall and dash that allow the gauge to operate \u2013 usually tubing or piping. The benefit though is that mechanical gauges tend to be slightly cheaper, as they don\u2019t require the purchase of the sensor or sending unit to pick up the signal and make the gauge operate. With either gauge, you will need to know several specifics on the vehicle you are working on :\n\nDo you have an accessible port to thread in and attach the sender or mechanical tap for the gauge? What size is it? Many gauges come with or you can purchase an installation kit that has adapters. Make sure you research all that you will need carefully.\nIs the sender for an electrical gauge available for the size port you need on your vehicle\u2019s engine? Or, is an adapter available to size correctly?\n\nIn the past, automotive enthusiasts believed mechanical gauges to offer better accuracy than their electrical counterparts. That is no longer the case. Provided you purchase an electrical gauge from a reliable manufacturer, you can likely assume it is as accurate as a mechanical alternative.\n\nAdding Gauges on Modern Vehicles\n\nOn modern vehicles, or vehicles in the \u201cTuner\u201d or Diesel truck era, there are several aftermarket gauges that are very popular. For vehicles with a Turbocharger, adding a boost gauge is popular, and certainly crucial if the car is being tuned or modified from its original factory boost pressures. Oddly, many cars during the dawn of Turbocharging in the 1980\u2019s had boost gauges, but today, most vehicles are not equipped with them. Cars not only benefit from a Boost Gauge, but Diesel trucks as well, as many of these owners are modifying for performance by adding more fuel, and more boost.\nAnother gauge that is gaining in popularity with Diesel trucks is an exhaust temperature gauge, or EGT gauge. With Diesel Trucks, when you add more fuel, more boost, and couple that with a hard working truck that tows, exhaust temperatures can rise rapidly. Temperatures nearing 1200 degrees in a high boost / high load situation can lead to catastrophic failure. Because of this, adding an EGT gauge to a Diesel Truck, so the driver can monitor temps is vital.\nLastly, and growing in popularity with all gas-fed vehicles is the air/fuel gauge. In order for proper, efficient combustion, a proper mix of air and fuel must be had. The science on this is known as Stoichiometry, or \u201cStoich\u201d for slang, and for gasoline engines, the Stoichiometric measurement for proper combustion is 14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel. From there, tuners will attempt to lean or richen the mixture slightly to find the perfect balance between the modification parts, turbo or supercharger boost (if applicable), the fuel, and performance the engine is making \u2013 all while attempting to keep it safe and from blowing up! To do this, a real-time air/fuel gauge is often added to monitor exactly what is going on with the mixture.\n\nInstallation\n\nAfter you have decided on the mechanical or electrical gauge, or what varieties of gauges, styles, and lighting options you wish to add, you are ready to move on to installation. The first task you must accomplish is deciding where to locate your new aftermarket gauge. Picking a spot that allows you to easily read the gauge without obstructing your road view makes sense. One common item is the gauge \u201cpillar-pods\u201d, which mount a gauge or series of gauges on the driver\u2019s side pillar in between the windshield and the driver\u2019s door. Many other aftermarket companies and gauge companies make pods that can be added to the dash, under the dash, or even sit right inside the gauge cluster itself.\nKeep in mind being careful when drilling into the dashboard itself, and remember that wherever you install your gauges, you will need to run a multitude of wiring to that location. Generally speaking, all gauges, especially electrical ones, are going to need 2 sources of voltage from somewhere \u2013 one, they will need a 12V source from the headlight switch that is 12V when either the parking or headlights are turned on. This source will power the lighting on your gauges, to operate when the headlights or parking lights are turned on. Two, you will need a 12V ignition source, meaning, a wire than has 12V when the ignition key is in the RUN position. Finally, the lighting circuit, and often the gauge itself, will need a ground wire as well.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Aftermarket Gauges\n\nAftermarket gauges are often an effective strategy for supplementing your vehicle\u2019s stock instrument cluster. Whether you want to get as much performance as possible out of your machine or simply want to minimize your chances of a catastrophic mechanical failure, installing an aftermarket gauge may be the right approach.",

        "title": "What is a Cold Air Intake?",
        "content": "How Does a Cold Air Intake\u00a0Work?\n\nAs a combustion engine, your car or truck\u2019s engine uses what amounts to a controlled explosion to fire your pistons. Gas or diesel serves as the fuel while an ignition source (spark plug in a gas engine, compression itself in a diesel) provides combustion. Oxygen is present in the air that surrounds your vehicle, but the enclosed nature of your hood prevents it from easily getting into your combustion chambers. The air intake is simply ductwork that allows the engines vacuum to pull air into the engine to mix with fuel and be fired. How much air it can pull is what\u2019s the question.\nWhile the OE model air intake works fine, it has the same problems as most stock parts. It\u2019s cheaply made to keep costs low and it\u2019s not specifically geared toward performance. After all, motor vehicle manufacturers don\u2019t know if you\u2019re buying their machine to commute to work, haul cargo, or drive fast. Secondly, because consumers generally care about a quiet, noise free cabin, intakes are designed to be quiet, which, similar to exhaust, often makes them very restrictive.\nYour typical stock unit has two main issues preventing it from operating efficiently. First, it\u2019s design is not catered to flow the maximum amount of flow (or CFM) possible. Secondly, it\u2019s design is simply to provide a quiet, efficient passage of air to the engine that the driver in the cabin cannot hear. OEM intakes generally have a\u00a0filter box\u00a0and duct work that is restrictive. This means air has to travel through the box, through the mesh of the filter, and through the restrictive tube to get to your engine. This is only made worse by the low-flow air filters you find in most cars and trucks. Couple that with an intake that\u2019s too close to the engine, drawing hotter air, and you have decreased performance.\nA cold air intake moves the intake point farther away from the engine, so it sucks in cooler air. Some of them also include a high-temperature shield to further reduce the heat radiating from your internal parts. By removing the air box , reducing restriction in the ducting, and getting rid of the low-quality paper filter, you create an intake that can flow more air per minute to the engine.\nYour vehicle is now using colder and denser air to run your powerplant. The denser the air, the more oxygen gets to your engine. This makes it operate more efficiently, providing a host of performance benefits.\n\nWhat Are the\u00a0Advantages of a Cold Air Intake?\n\nDo cold air intakes work? The increased oxygen flow can net you between 5 and 20 horsepower depending on your engine and the product you buy. Higher quality intakes obviously work better, but they can\u2019t turn a 4-cylinder into a V8 power, so keep your expectations realistic.\nBeyond the horsepower increase, cold air intakes can also provide better throttle response and improved fuel economy. When your engine has the ability to get more air, it has the ability to create more power.\nAnother plus of an aftermarket air intake is saying goodbye to low-quality paper filters. Not only can you install a high-flow filter, it also means don\u2019t have to replace it every 15,000 miles. Many of the filters available for cold air intakes can be removed and washed to clean them. Just remember to do it as part of your regular maintenance: a dirty filter won\u2019t do its job.\nTo increase the benefits of your install, consider adding a few other mods to your machine. The air intake is only one side of the oxygen coin. Spent gases can choke off your engine, preventing the cold air from being as effective. A\u202fperformance exhaust system\u00a0removes more of these gases from your engine, allowing for better combustion. An ECU tuner can provide a better fuel/air mixture to get the most from these components. Combining all 3 together \u2013 air intake, exhaust, and an ECU tune is generally referred to as \u201cStage 1\u201d in the tuning and modification world \u2013 it\u2019s the first and most basic steps to getting increased performance.\nThat isn\u2019t to say you need either of these additions to gain the benefits of a cold air intake. You still have denser air providing more oxygen to your engine. These mods just add to the advantages of the component.\n\nDo Cold Air Intakes Cause\u00a0Problems?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to recommend cold air intakes, but every mod has its minuses. Newer vehicles often feature more complicated components. Manufacturers generally limit the mods you can install to limit liability. In the case of an aftermarket air intake, this means the part may void your warranty. Check your warranty to see if this is true for your car or truck.\nThe lack of a box increases the chances your intake could suck up some water. Small amounts can cause misfires, ruin spark plugs, and reduce performance. If a larger volume of water gets into the combustion chamber, it won\u2019t compress under the piston, causing severe engine damage. For driving in wet areas, you should install a bypass valve on your air intake to prevent water from getting into your engine.\nThe shape of the intake occasionally causes problems as well. The air is coming from a difference angle than it is on an OE model, which can throw off the idle of your engine. It can also send inaccurate readings to your sensors, throwing off the fuel/air mixture. This issue is fairly rare, however, and can often be fixed with some tuning.\nFinally, cold air intakes do not take into consideration, much like performance exhaust, that additional sound can be an issue. In most vehicles, you will immediately hear a sound with a cold air intake you didn\u2019t hear before \u2013 the sound of air sucking or flowing through the intake! On vehicles with a turbo, this sound is often much more pronounced. For some owners, this sound, much like a well tuned, throaty exhaust is desired. For others, it may be considered too much.",

        "title": "Forced Induction: Superchargers and Turbochargers",
        "content": "What is Forced Induction?\n\nForced induction forces more air into the engine allowing it to run more efficiently and make more power. Naturally aspirated engines (engines with no super- or turbochargers) make limited power due to air intake. Natural aspiration means that atmospheric force is responsible for pushing air into the engine. This force is about 14.7 lbs, and it varies with elevation. Turbo and superchargers have greater intake force for increased performance.\nNaturally aspirated engines tend to only make a peak volumetric efficiency of 75% to 85%. While naturally aspirated engines can make more power through other upgrades to air intake and exhaust systems, they are unlikely to make 100% or higher efficiency without the help of forced induction. Forcing more air in gives each intake cycle more oxygen, which increases power by letting the engine burn more fuel and do more work. How much more power the engine makes, depends on how much boost the forced induction system supplies.\nBoost refers to the amount of air that is forced into the engine and is measured in psi. The more boost, the more power the engine will make. That said, it\u2019s important to make sure that the car\u2019s engine and other components are built strong enough to stand up to the extra pressure. Otherwise that sweet super- or turbocharger might just blow up an engine from running it too fast. Other parts of the car may need to be modified to withstand the extra power too.\nSo, what is the difference between a supercharger and a turbocharger? Both use turbines to force air induction, but they turn the compressor a little differently. At their simplest:\n\nSuperchargers get their rotational energy from the serpentine belt or another drive belt\nTurbochargers are powered by exhaust gases\n\nBoth use turbines to force additional air into the engine, speeding up the rate of air intake and allowing the engine to consume greater amounts of air. They differ in where they get the energy that is used to rotate the turbines.\n\nHow Does a Supercharger Work?\n\nSuperchargers are mechanically driven forced induction devices. In most cases, they are driven using a pulley that is wrapped in the serpentine belt. This allows the crankshaft to turn the compressor, creating boost for the engine so it can make more horsepower and torque.\nThey aren\u2019t always driven by a belt. These are the different supercharger drive types:\n\nBelt (V-belt, Synchronous belt, Flat belt)\nDirect drive\nGear drive\nChain drive\n\nRegardless of exactly how they are driven, superchargers get their power from the crankshaft. Depending on their configuration, they can consume up to 30% of the crankshaft\u2019s energy! This makes them better suited for big engines than small ones.\nFor example: on a supercharged engine that generates 400 horsepower, the supercharger alone might consume 150 horsepower from the engine. This is a good trade-off, because it basically lets you trade 150 horsepower for 400, giving an increase in engine output by 250 horsepower. While it is a good trade, you need that 150 horsepower to spare if you\u2019re going to install a supercharger.\n\nHow Does a Turbocharger Work?\n\nTurbochargers are driven by exhaust gases. They feature two fans, a turbine and a compressor. Exhaust gas is routed through a tube in the turbo that turns the turbine, which sits in the exhaust stream. The compressor sits in the air intake, and because it is attached to the turbine, it spins with it. That\u2019s how the compressor speeds up air intake to speed up the engine.\nBecause turbos get their energy from exhaust gases after they have exited the engine, they run more efficiently than superchargers, which rely on the crankshaft. This can help them make more power on smaller engines, and it also makes them more fuel efficient. That\u2019s why turbochargers are increasingly common on economy cars and compact cars: they are one of the best ways to make more power from a small engine.\n\nOE Turbos\n\nTurbochargers have long been associated with tuned-up sports cars, but recently turbos have come as original equipment for all sorts of vehicles.\nThat\u2019s because turbos are run by exhaust gases that must leave the engine regardless of forced induction, turbos increase the engine\u2019s efficiency, and the fact that adding a turbo adds less weight than making the engine bigger does. As a result, turbocharged engines can weigh substantially less than similarly-powered naturally aspirated engines.\nThe other reason turbochargers are popular on economy cars is because of turbo lag. The turbo is driven by the engine\u2019s exhaust gases, so it doesn\u2019t kick in until enough is being exhausted. That creates turbo lag: the gap between when you first press the gas pedal and when the engine is at high enough an RPM to drive the compressor. That means that a turbocharged vehicle generates less power and uses less gas when driven at low RPM.\n\nBe Smart About Forced Induction\n\nSuperchargers and turbos are commonly added onto cars by tuners in search of more power. Cars that come turbo- or supercharged stock are designed to operate with the power that is added by forced induction. A car that you decide to install forced induction onto may not be.\nTo further complicate things, these devices can provide different amounts of boost. An OE turbo will be designed by the manufacturer to provide a level of boost at which the engine can run reliably. Whether or not the same can be said for an aftermarket forced induction set-up depends on a whole host of factors, meaning you need to do a lot of research before adding forced induction to a vehicle.\nForced induction can help the engine make more power, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. If you supply an engine with more boost than it can withstand, it can destroy the engine. Other parts may need to be upgraded to withstand the added boost too.\nThese are some common parts to be upgraded before adding forced induction:\n\nBetter Suspension: Upgrading struts, coil springs, anti-sway bars, and other suspension components can improve handling, which is crucial to keeping the car manageable when boosted\nCold Air Intakes: These give air a longer intake to travel, resulting in colder air entering the engine\nHigh Flow Exhaust: Upgrades to the exhaust system can help alleviate back pressure by letting exhaust gases flow more freely\nPerformance Fuel Injectors: These are crucial to upgrade on vehicles that do not use a carburetor. While carburetors will adjust the rate at which they let fuel into the engine automatically, modern cars need new fuel injectors so that they can maintain the ideal air-fuel ratio with the new air from the boost\nIntercoolers: Forced induction compresses air, heating up the air. Intercoolers cool off the air before it reaches the engine to keep it from running too hot\n\nWhat all needs to be updated depends on the build, and how much boost you are trying to achieve. In order to withstand higher amounts of boost, more parts will need to be upgraded to withstand the added boost. There are also many parts that are used to install forced induction parts. Often you can get everything you need at once with a supercharger kit, which includes all parts necessary for working forced induction.\nRegardless of the exact upgrades you choose to make, forced induction is a great way to increase the horsepower and torque output of a vehicle. It\u2019s important to make sure the rest of your vehicle can take the boost, but there\u2019s still no better way to make far more power than your vehicle is built for.\n\nShop Performance Parts",

        "title": "How to Upgrade Performance",
        "content": "How to Upgrade to a High Performance\n\n1. Upgrade the Engine\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to look at your engine as a big air pump. The faster and better the air flows through the engine, the faster your car will move. One great upgrade that can help achieve this is a cold air intake system. Brands like Specter and K&N offer high-performance systems that replace the factory air filter and intake housing. This design reduces intake restrictions and allows for a larger amount of air to flow into the engine, resulting in more usable power and better acceleration.\n\n2. Upgrade the Exhaust System\n\nAnother way to increase horsepower is to improve the performance and sound of your exhaust system. Replacing the factory mufflers with high-flow performance mufflers from Flow Master or Magna Flow can make a significant difference. If you\u2019re not comfortable with cutting and welding, a local muffler shop can help with the installation. Another option is a cat-back exhaust system that replaces the factory system from the catalytic converters to the rear of the car. This upgrade can be done with simple hand tools and provides real performance gains.\nA full performance exhaust system can also free up some horsepower. There are two options to choose from \u2013 a bolt-on kit designed to fit your car or a universal kit from Flow Master that you can customize to fit your vehicle. The full system includes mandrel bends to reduce resistance and an option for a crossover pipe or an X pipe for scavenging. You can also choose the performance muffler that best suits your performance goals or desired sound. This is a heavy DIY project that requires cutting and welding, so a local exhaust shop can help if you\u2019re not comfortable with your skills.\n\n3. Upgrade the brakes\n\nIf you want a car that goes fast, then you better make sure it can stop fast, and upgrading your brakes is something that most of us can do. For performance, you want to look at your pads, calipers, and your rotors. And if you want a little extra flare, you can use some custom caliper covers, or go on to the full brake kit.\n\n4. Upgrade Tires & Handling\n\nYou have got to be able to control your car, especially when it\u2019s screaming at the top of its RPM range. You can really improve the handling with some performance tires, and you can get better feedback with a performance steering wheel. Most stock steering wheels are typically a larger diameter; they\u2019re made from molded plastic, and they can be hard to hang on to in extreme conditions. A smaller diameter wheel, covered in leather or suede give you better feedback, a better grip, and better car control.\n\n5. Upgrade fluids and chemicals\n\nHigh performance means high heat, and if you\u2019re dealing with high heat, you\u2019ve got to go with synthetic. One of the best benefits of synthetic oil is that the oil itself doesn\u2019t break down as fast. The viscosity stays the same for a longer period of time, and especially under extreme conditions. But it\u2019s not just your engine oil. Synthetic and performance fluids throughout your vehicle can free up horsepower with less friction, and better protect your parts under stress, all at the same time. \n\n6. Reprogram the system\n\nPower programmers are a simple and proven way to really wake up your car, providing power gains up to 30 horsepower or even more in some diesel applications. They use a data cable that connects the programmer to your car\u2019s computer by plugging into the car\u2019s diagnostic port of a \u201996 and newer vehicle. A programmer can access and change tuning data that controls air and fuel into your engine, timing events, even transmission shift points, and line pressures to give you more power and a better performance feel, better towing, and even better fuel economy, depending on how the programmer is set.",

Plastic or Metal Air Intake Tube?\n\nAir intake tubes are made from either plastic, resin (or carbon fiber), or metal \u2013 usually aluminum. Plastic intake tubes are typically quieter, while metal air intake tubes look flashier in various colors or finishes. Typically, metal intake tubes will tend to hold heat longer than plastic, even though aluminum by far dissipates heat far better than steel.\n\n2. Oiled or Dry Air Filter?\n\nCold air intake systems come with oiled or dry air filters. Oiled filters are covered with a thin layer of oil to trap dirt. Dry filters rely on layers of cotton gauze or synthetic fabric, to keep out contaminants. Oiled air filters are reusable and long-lasting.\nYou can drive close to 50,000 miles before an oiled air filter ever needs cleaning under normal road driving conditions. Cleaning is just a bath of warm soapy water and reapplication of oil. Dry filters don\u2019t require cleaning, but cannot be reused. You\u2019ll need to replace the filter after 15,000 to 30,000 miles or as the manufacturer suggests. Read and follow recommendations on the package. Note \u2013 over-oiling of an oiled filter can lead to Mass Airflow sensor (MAF) failure, so it\u2019s important to be careful when servicing an oiled filter.\n\n3. Which Brand to Buy?\n\nMost systems will work for any vehicle, but when in doubt, it\u2019s a good idea to choose a cold air intake system from a brand that caters to your vehicle type. K&N has produced cold air intake systems for decades, and it\u2019s one of the most popular brands of cold air intake systems thanks to extensive coverage.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to start searching for a new intake, browse online or talk to a store associate at your local AutoZone.",

        "title": "How To Clean Fuel Injectors",
        "content": "Understanding Fuel Injectors\n\nInternal combustion engines need a precise mixture of fuel and air to function. Fuel injectors deliver fuel to your car\u2019s combustion chamber. That is, they spray just enough fuel into the chamber for your engine to burn effectively. If an injector supplies too much or too little, it won\u2019t run well or it won\u2019t run at all. While there are a few reasons air-fuel mixture may be rich, clogged fuel injectors often cause lean mixtures.\nTo remove carbon and other types of buildup from your vehicle\u2019s fuel injectors, you must use a high-quality injector cleaner. There are hundreds of cleaners on the market today. While there is a difference in fuel system cleaners, any cleaner that you use at 100% strength is apt to do a good job. Said another way, the cleaner you choose probably depends on both personal preference and brand loyalty.\n\nIdentifying Clogged Fuel Injectors\n\nClogged fuel injectors are likely to make your vehicle\u2019s engine idle roughly or stall altogether. If carbon accumulates on the diffusing tip of your car\u2019s fuel injectors, you may also burn more gas and get worse fuel economy. Fortunately, before you get to either point, your vehicle\u2019s Check Engine Light will probably turn on. \nAs you probably know, fuel has detergent additives in it that attempt to prevent fuel injectors from clogging. Still, these do not always do the trick. On the contrary, gunk in the fuel supply may eventually cause a clog. Alternatively, rust from your vehicle\u2019s gas tank or a bad fuel filter may contribute to clogged fuel injectors. Either way, you must know how to clean fuel injectors to keep your vehicle running optimally.\n\nCleaning Fuel Injectors With Removal\n\nArguably, the best way to clean fuel injectors is to remove them from your vehicle\u2019s engine. This, of course, allows you to thoroughly remove gunk. Even though there are a few steps involved in this type of cleaning, the effort is usually worthwhile, especially if the fuel injectors haven\u2019t been cleaned in years.\n\nFirst, remove the fuel injectors from your vehicle\u2019s engine. Since each engine is different, The amount of disassembly will vary significantly. You\u2019ll need to disconnect the fuel supply and remove the fuel rails, in most cases. Fortunately, your vehicle\u2019s service manual likely provides in-depth instructions on the process. If not, consult an aftermarket maintenance manual.\n\nNext, remove the rubber o-ring from the fuel rail side of the injector. Generally, you cannot reuse fuel injector rings, so be sure you buy replacements before beginning the project. After you have removed the fuel injectors and the o-rings, attach a rubber hose to the opening using hose clamps. This ensures no cleaner spills during the cleaning process.\n\nYou need some electricity to effectively clean fuel injectors. Therefore, you must connect one side of an electrical lead to the injectors. The other side, you connect to the positive terminal of your vehicle\u2019s battery. Only connect this lead, though, when you are ready for a spark.\n\nTo ensure you completely clean your fuel injectors, disconnect the rubber hose from the rail side and attach it to the outflow side. Then, allow the cleaner to flow through the injectors the opposite way. This is likely to remove any deposits or buildup that your rail-side cleaning missed.\n\nFinally, attach a new o-ring and re-insert the fuel injector.\n\nAfter you have cleaned one injector, you are ready to move onto the others.\n\nCleaning Fuel Injectors Without Removal\n\nIf you want to know how to clean fuel injectors without removal from the engine, you have some options. You may use a gasoline additive that cleans fuel injectors. The problem with this approach, though, is twofold. First, these cleaners dilute into a full tank of gas, weakening their potency and effectiveness. Secondly, they also only flow through injectors in one direction, making them less effective at removing carbon and other types of buildup.\nA better approach is to invest in a fuel injector cleaning kit. These kits come with a canister that holds cleaner and a hose that attaches to your vehicle\u2019s fuel injectors. While the design of these kits varies, most have a lid that screws off the canister. After unscrewing the lid, pour fuel injector cleaner into the container. Next, hang the canister on the underside of the hood to ensure you have a steady flow of cleaner into your vehicle\u2019s fuel injectors.\nThen, screw the hose end onto the vehicle\u2019s fuel rail at the test port. To locate the fuel rail, find the fuel injectors under your hood or read through your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual. If these approaches do not do the trick, a quick online search can help you locate the fuel rail.\nNext, you need to turn the fuel pump off. To do so, remove the fuse that controls it from the fuse box. This disables the fuel pump, allowing gravity to pull cleaner from the canister into the engine. If your cleaner kit operates on air power instead of gravity, you also must hook the kit up to an air supply, such as a compressor. Then, you must turn the pressure gauge to the correct setting, usually about 50 PSI.\nFinally, start the vehicle\u2019s engine. Note, though, after attaching the cleaning kit and removing the fuel pump fuse, the car may be a bit tough to start. When all the cleaner empties from the canister, you have successfully cleaned your car\u2019s fuel injectors without removing them. Of course, you must remove the cleaning kit and re-insert the fuel pump fuse to finish the process.\nAs you may suspect, different cleaning kits may vary in their functionality. While these instructions should give you a general idea of how these kits work, you should read through the manufacturer\u2019s instructions completely to be sure you do the job correctly.\n\nHelpful Resources for Fuel Injectors\n\nKeeping Your Vehicle Running Optimally\n\nWhether you need to know how to clean fuel injectors by removing them or want to do the job without tearing apart your vehicle\u2019s engine, having clean injectors is an effective way to keep your vehicle running right. However you choose to tackle the project, it is worth your time and effort.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "How to Flush Brake Fluid",
        "content": "Why Does Brake Fluid Wear Out?\nBrake fluid, a hydraulic fluid, by its chemical design is hygroscopic, which means it absorbs water at a rapid rate. This presents problems in any brake system as the master cylinder, lines, proportioning valves,\u00a0ABS system, and calipers are all composed of parts made from aluminum or steel, metals that corrode in water! Brake fluid is arguably the most ignored fluid change on your car, with some cars going all the way to brake component failure until the component is changed and fluid is flushed. Don\u2019t let it get that far!\nAny time the brake system is exposed to any air (usually from the master cylinder reservoir), the fluid absorbs moisture, and as it does so, it\u2019s color turns from clear to a rusty brown over the course of thousands of miles, as corrosion begins inside the brake system. The more water in the fluid, the lower the brake fluid boiling point becomes (think of how hot brakes operate) and the more corrosive the fluid gets. Corrosive brake fluid is the #1 reason why calipers and wheel cylinders begin to seize, as corrosion inside the bores of the cylinder occurs from the contaminated fluid.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Brake Fluid Flush?\nHere enters the brake fluid flush. A car owner who can proactively flush their brake fluid every time a set of pads or shoes is/are installed on their car (usually every 35-60K miles) reduces the risk of brake fade and future caliper or wheel cylinder failure, and they will get overall better brake performance.\nPerforming a brake fluid flush is an easy task, like changing oil. Before anything, be sure to always make sure to read who to properly bleed the brake system by doing a 2-person brake bleed. If you are unsure, you can always take your car to your preferred mechanic and ask for the fluid to be flushed.\nIf you are familiar with how to bleed brakes, you will be performing this process the same way as when you change a caliper, brake line, or wheel cylinder. This process is best done by a simple 2-person brake bleed \u2013 one person operating the pedal and holding, while the other opens the bleeder screw for less than 2 seconds. You will also need a quart of your favorite brand, and type of brake fluid (remember to check whether the car takes DOT 3 or DOT 4 fluid).\n\nHow to Bleed Brake Fluid by Yourself\nBrake fluid should be replaced every 2-4 years, or if your brake pedal feels spongy. With a brake bleeder tool, you bleed your brakes in about an hour without any additional help.\nRead More \n\nHow to Bleed Brake Fluid the Lazy Way (Gravity Bleed)\nBleeding your brake system can be done a few ways. This option only requires one person, and is less labor intensive.\nRead More \n\nHow to Bleed Brake Fluid with a Friend\nBleeding your brake system can be done a few ways. This method requires two people. \nRead More \n\nHow to Flush and Change Brake Fluid\n\n1. Empty the Master Cylinder Reservoir\n\nThe first step is to completely remove all the fluid that\u2019s currently sitting inside the master cylinder reservoir. This can be done a number of ways, but a large syringe, turkey baster, small siphon pump, or transfer pump and tube can easy remove all the fluid from the reservoir while the car is off and in park, with no pressure on the brakes.\n\n2. Fill and Bleed\n\nNext, fill the reservoir with fresh fluid. From here on out, the process is no different than bleeding brakes. Having a small, 2 foot section of clear tubing to fit over the bleeder screw makes the process easy to see when the old fluid has all been removed.\nSimply start at the rear of the car first, and bleed out the 2 rear calipers/wheel cylinders. You will know when the old fluid has all been removed when the rusty, brown fluid is gone and fresh, clear fluid is flowing through the tube.\nThen, move on to the fronts, being sure to re-check the master cylinder reservoir after each wheel is bled. \n\n3. Top It Off\n\nAfter your last wheel, fill the reservoir back to the fill line and you\u2019re done!\n\nHow Often Should You Change Your Brake Fluid?\nThat is a great, and often debated question because it\u2019s one of the few fluids that car manufacturers do not normally set a change interval. A good practice though is every 3 years or 30,000 miles.",

        "title": "DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 Brake Fluid: What's the Difference?",
        "content": "How Brake Fluid Works\n\nBefore we start explaining the difference between DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluid, you need a basic understanding of what brake fluid does. This will give you an idea of how the different ratings impact your brake system performance.\nMost cars use a hydraulic braking system. When you press the brake pedal, this pressure sends brake fluid into your calipers, which press the pads into the rotors. As you apply more pressure, the pads and rotors will generate more friction and the car will come to a stop more quickly.\nWithout brake fluid, you won\u2019t be able to stop. Additionally, you should change your brake fluid from time to time, because it does go bad over time. It can absorb moisture, which can prevent your brakes from working properly. Bad brake fluid can cause your brake system to malfunction, which can be deadly. Ultimately, maintaining your brake fluid is crucial for safe driving.\nFor those wondering why moisture is so bad for the fluid, it is simple. Fresh brake fluid has a boiling point that is a higher temperature than would be produced while braking. However, water has a much lower boiling point and can boil from the temperatures produced during braking.\nMoisture which has been absorbed by the brake fluid can boil, releasing gas. With this gas in your braking system, pressing the brake will simply compress the gas, instead of pushing the brake fluid to your rotors. Essentially, boiling brake fluid may lead to you hitting the brake and the pedal simply going to the floor without slowing the vehicle. This is why regularly replacing your brake fluid is important.\n\nWhat are Brake Fluid Ratings, and What do They Mean?\n\nThe ratings are developed in regard to your brake fluid\u2019s boiling point. Boiling points are broken down into two categories. The dry boiling point is the boiling point for fluid that hasn\u2019t been contaminated with water or other pollutants. The wet boiling point is the boiling point for fluid that has water. Traditionally, these are rated as DOT 3 or DOT 4 brake fluid. The DOT here stands for The Department of Transportation, the group which defines the ratings.\nTypically, when comparing DOT 3 vs. DOT 4, DOT 3 brake fluid has a dry boiling point of 401 degrees Fahrenheit, and a wet boiling point of 284 degrees Fahrenheit. Given the fact there is no standard formula for most brake fluids, this is an estimated boiling point, and the exact boiling points for these may vary. Typical DOT 3 fluids easily exceed these values. DOT 3 fluid typically includes 80% glycol ether base which is one of the factors that contribute to water absorption.\nDOT 4 Fluids both have higher Dry Boil Points and wet boil points which are required in brake systems that produce more heat due to faster speeds, heavier towing loads, etc. DOT 4 absorbs moisture faster than DOT 3 brake fluids and should be changed more regularly. DOT 4 fluid typically has 50 to 65% glycol ether base with 20-30 % Borate Ester which helps resist the boiling of the fluid, meaning you have 3.7% moisture in your DOT 3 fluid the fluid will boil at roughly 290\u00b0F. The same amount of moisture in your DOT 4 Brake Fluid will boil at around 330\u00b0F. The DOT 4 fluid will absorb that 3.7% water amount 20% faster than a DOT 3 Fluid.\nWhen examining DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 brake fluid, the boiling point and lifespan are the most notable distinctions between types. You\u2019ll have to replace DOT 4 more often than DOT 3 brake fluid.\n\nDOT 3 vs DOT 4 Brake Fluid\n\nWhen comparing the differences between the two, you should keep in mind that as there is no standard formula for brake fluids, and each type of brake fluid may contain different compounds or chemicals, there are only a few differences that distinguish DOT 3 vs. DOT 4 brake fluid. \nThe primary differences between the two include the following:\nDOT 3 brake fluid will absorb less water than DOT 4 from the air over time, meaning you\u2019ll need to have your fluid changed less frequently.DOT 4 brake fluid has higher dry and wet boiling points, making it safer for higher temperatures.\nUltimately, the difference between DOT 3 and DOT 4 brake fluids lies in their ability to handle the heat and water absorption. When you need your brake fluid changed, you should consult your owner\u2019s manual to see what type of brake fluid your car recommends. You should not mix different types of brake fluid, as this can cause your brakes to malfunction due to incompatibility. \nIf you\u2019re uncertain what type of brake fluid you\u2019ll need, you can reach out to us at AutoZone and one of our team members will help you determine what your vehicle requires.",

        "title": "What Fluids in a Car Need to be Changed?",
        "content": "Car Fluids You Need to Change\n\n1. Motor Oil\n\nWhen your engine is in operation, a lot of metal parts rub against each other. This rubbing would generate a lot of friction and heat without oil to lubricate the engine\u2019s internals. Engine oil also acts as a coolant to keep hot engine parts, like the bottom of the piston and skirts cool.\nTraditional wisdom puts the oil change interval every 3 months or 3,000 miles, but this interval will differ depending on your year, make, model, and engine, as well as the type of oil you use (conventional or synthetic). Check your owner\u2019s manual for the correct interval.\n\n2. Transmission Fluid\n\nRegardless of whether you have a manual or Automatic transmission, it contains fluid that needs to be changed in intervals. This fluid lubricates the gears and synchros in a manual transmission, and does the same with clutch packs and gears in an automatic transmission. You don\u2019t need to change transmission fluid nearly as often as oil, but it\u2019s important to note that neglecting it can quickly lead to transmission failure, which is nearly as costly a repair as changing an engine. Most manufacturers recommend transmission fluid changes between 25-40,000 miles.\n\n3. Brake Fluid\n\nMost braking systems use hydraulic fluid with a Master Cylinder to compress Brake Calipers, which then squeeze the pads to the rotors and bring the vehicle to the stop. Brake fluid is hygroscopic, which means it absorbs water, which leads to rust, corrosion, and a lower boiling point for brake fluid, which operates at extremely hot temperatures near the caliper. Brake fluid should generally should be flushed every 25,000 miles or when the pads and rotors are replaced. Learn more about flushing brake fluid here.\n\n4. Engine Coolant\n\nEngine coolant, or antifreeze, does what it sounds like it would do: it cools your engine. Without it, the engine would overheat and seize. When you need new coolant and what coolant you need depends on what you drive, so check that owner\u2019s manual, or read here about what antifreeze you need, or how to flush and fill it.\n\n5. Power Steering Fluid\n\nHydraulic power steering systems use hydraulic fluid similarly to how brake fluid works. Over time, this fluid goes through a multitude of heat cycles, gets dirty, and begins to break down. Power steering fluid generally gets neglected the most out of any fluid, but it also tends to last the longest. A service interval of 60-80,000 miles is generally ok.\n\n6. Differential Fluid\n\nNo matter what kind of car you have, you have some form of a differential, which through a series of gears, transmits the engine-to-transmission torque to the axles and wheels. 4 wheel drive vehicles generally have a front and rear differential, and many AWD vehicles have a center differential as well as a rear. This gear oil breaks down over time, gets dirty, and needs to be changed. Most manufacturers put the interval at 80-120,000 miles, so check accordingly.\n\n7. Windshield Washer Fluid\n\nWasher fluid isn\u2019t a crucial maintenance fluid in that your car can still function without it. That said, you\u2019ll regret not topping it up if something gets on your windshield while you\u2019re driving. There are special formulations for removing bugs or ice and frost as well as general purpose fluids. There\u2019s no precise interval for replacing this fluid, but you can check it under the hood and fill up as needed.\nIt\u2019s important to note though, that different washer fluid has different freeze temperatures, and if you live in the northern half of the country that encounters below-15 degree temperatures, it\u2019s important to note that not all washer fluid is equal. Summertime washer fluid, like Bug Wash, can freeze in sub-zero temperatures, rendering your washer system useless when you most need it. Once fall comes, it\u2019s a great idea to get any summertime fluid out, and replace it with De-icer, which is always rated into negative temperatures.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You\n\nFind a Repair Shop",

        "title": "Bad Power Steering Pump: Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Before diving into the specifics of the power steering pump replacement, it is necessary to understand the equipment, symptoms, and safety concerns. As an integral steering component, it is unwise to drive with a failing pump, but how do you know when it is time to replace the part? Also, are you only going to need to replace this part once in the lifetime of your vehicle? The power steering pump is an intricate engine component, and while you may not be able to identify it now, by the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the purpose of this part and when to replace it. Also, you will understand how the cost of a replacement is broken down, and whether you can save money or not.\n\nUnderstanding the Power Steering Pump\n\nWhat is a power steering pump? Most classic cars did not have power steering, which meant they were harder to turn and control. As steering systems evolved, engineers found ways to ease the steering process using hydraulics. The power steering pump is a critical component of the hydraulic system. The pump circulates and pressurizes power steering fluid. When the pressurized fluid is transferred through a hose to the steering pump, it is used to help turn the wheel. As the wheel turns, another hose returns the fluid back through the pump, where it is pressurized again. The process is continuous while the engine is running, meaning that you are never left without steering assistance. Since most drivers own vehicles equipped with power steering, it quickly becomes obvious when the pump is failing because of\u00a0power steering problems like a hard to turn wheel.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad Power Steering Pump\n\n1. Fluid Leaks\n\nOne of the most common signs of pump failure is a fluid leak. Power steering fluid is a red or reddish-brown color. Check for puddles after driving. While a leak is not a definitive sign of a bad pump, it does signal that there is something wrong with the system.\n\n2. Noises\n\nNext, you may hear the power steering pump making strange noises. If you hear groaning, whining or screeching noises when you turn the wheel or increase engine RPMs, then your power steering pump may be going bad. The pump is driven by a belt, which also can result in strange sounds, so check your belt as well.\n\n3. Hard to Turn Steering Wheel\n\nFinally, as the pump goes bad, you will notice an increased difficulty when turning your car. You will likely struggle the most when going slow or stopped.\n\nSafety and Caution\n\nIf you hear a power steering pump noise or suspect an issue with the system, it is best to have your vehicle towed to a safe location, like your garage or a repair shop. While it is technically safe to drive a car with a leaking power steering pump, you must keep in mind the risk of doing so. If the leak is faster than you expect, then you risk damaging the power steering system. Permanent damage is a risk, which is why it is better to err on the side of caution. Do not drive a vehicle you think has a pump issue. Call for a tow. It is always better to be safe than sorry. While it is best to repair the problem quickly, you may be able to save a few bucks doing the repair yourself, but only if you have the skill set.\n\nCost of Replacement\n\nIt is difficult to specify an exact cost because the price of a replacement part varies based on vehicle make and model. The estimate for the entire pump replacement is $100 to $200 for parts. If you are handy, then you may be able to save around $300, which is a likely cost for labor. Again, these estimates are rough because even labor costs can vary from place to place. While it is tempting to save some money and do the job yourself, keep in mind that a pump repair is likely part of a larger project, requiring a more advanced skill set. You may be able to find a cheaper part and then pay someone to install it, but that depends on the shop.\n\nFrequency of Replacement\n\nMost vehicle components have an expected lifespan, and power steering pumps are no different. A pump typically lasts up to 100,000 miles or better before experiencing any significant issues. However, much of that longevity has to do with maintaining a proper maintenance schedule.\nBecause steering pumps last so long, any repair work is usually found in used vehicles, especially because of how many car owners lease. Although, that does not mean that a younger model won\u2019t experience unexpected failure or problems. Always be mindful of the symptoms and signs of a failing pump, so you can avoid significant harm to your car\u2019s steering system.",

Safety and Prep\n\nWear protective gloves and eyewear throughout these steps.\nPark in a well-ventilated area, start your engine, idle for 5 minutes, and write down the engine\u2019s idle speed before shutting the car off.\nOnce the engine\u2019s off, pop the hood and locate your vehicle\u2019s throttle body. Look after the engine air filter and boot connection on the engine side. Use your screwdriver to loosen the clamp that holds the intake boot, and pull back the top of the boot slightly.\n\n2. Ready the Can\n\nShake the can gently, uncoil the hose, and hang the intake cleaner can above the throttle body or on the hook for the hood latch. Make sure that the hose is clear of belts, fans, or any other moving parts, and that the can is away from any sources of extreme heat.\nAfter positioning the can, insert the hose end towards the throttle plate, keeping the hose in place on the throttle body with the protective aluminum guide. Then reattach the air intake boot back on the throttle body and create a tight seal.\nNOTE: Do not feed the hose into the Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor.\n\n3. Dispense the Formula and Rev\n\nTurn the red dial all the way to \u201cI\u201d and then turn the blue switch to the \u201cI\u201d position.

        "title": "How To Find and Fix Coolant Leaks",
        "content": "Understanding Coolant Leaks\n\nCoolant is an essential fluid. That is, if you do not have the right amount of fluid, you are asking for serious trouble that may include substantial engine damage. As such, you should routinely check your car\u2019s coolant levels. If you regularly find that you are adding new fluid to your system, there is a good chance you have a coolant leak.\n\nHow to Detect Coolant Leaks\n\nCOMMON SOURCES OF COOLANT LEAKS\n\n1. A BLOWN HEAD GASKET\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s head gasket seals the space between its\u00a0cylinder head\u00a0and engine block. If the head gasket fails, coolant, and engine oil may mix. You may also notice that coolant is leaking from the bottom of the engine and dripping onto the ground. Either way, a blown head gasket can be disastrous for your engine.\n\n2. A DAMAGED HEATER CORE\n\nYour\u00a0heater core\u00a0is essentially a small radiator that disperses heat into your vehicle\u2019s passenger cabin. While you cannot see the heater core, it may develop a coolant leak. If it does, fluid may accumulate in the plastic housing on the bottom of the heater core.\n\n3. A CRACKED OR DAMAGED HOSE\n\nCoolant may move through many\u00a0different hoses\u00a0under your vehicle\u2019s hood. If one of these hoses develops a crack or hole, coolant may leak.\n\n4. LOOSE OR WORN-OUT HOSE CONNECTIONS\n\nHoses in your vehicle\u2019s cooling system must connect to different components. Some connections may have\u00a0hose clamps, while others may attach on their own. Any place a hose connects, though, is prone to springing a coolant leak.\n\n5. A BROKEN RADIATOR\n\nModern coolant has anti-corrosive agents that help protect your radiator from damage. Still, sometimes radiators develop holes. If your vehicle\u2019s radiator has one, you may notice a leak in front of your engine.\n\nCoolant leaks are serious business any time of the year. That is, even though coolant is commonly called antifreeze, it is essential year-round. Therefore, if you have a car leaking coolant, you must take the leak seriously. Fortunately, finding a coolant leak may not be as difficult as you may think.\n\nFinding Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nOften, finding a coolant leak is simple, as you can see fluid dripping from beneath your vehicle\u2019s hood. You may also notice bubbles in the\u00a0coolant reservoir\u00a0or at a hose connection. You must be careful when checking fluid levels, though. If the engine is not completely cool before you remove the radiator cap, you may suffer a serious burn from escaping steam or hot coolant. Therefore, you should never open the radiator cap or the coolant reservoir when your car\u2019s engine is hot.\nTypically, a coolant leak presents itself in just a few ways. For example, your vehicle\u2019s engine may overheat. If this happens, the\u00a0temperature gauge\u00a0on your instrument panel is likely to move upward, perhaps into the red zone. You may also notice steam coming from under your hood. Or, your vehicle may stall. If your car has a low-coolant indicator light, it may also illuminate.\nTo locate a coolant leak, first look for puddles of coolant beneath your vehicle. If you see any, you probably have fluid dripping from somewhere in the system. With the car\u2019s engine running, look under the hood to see if you notice any fluid flowing out. If you do, trace the fluid to its source. Do not forget to check hose connections and components for leaks. Allowing your vehicle to climb to normal operating temperature and turning on the air conditioner increases pressure in your coolant system. This procedure may allow you to more easily detect a coolant leak.\nIf you cannot see a leak but you are losing coolant, you may need to perform a\u00a0coolant pressure test. A pressure tester is a hand-held tool that allows you to gauge the pressure inside your cooling system. If you have low pressure, you probably have a leak somewhere.\n\nFixing Coolant\u00a0Leaks\n\nThe best way to fix a coolant leak is to track down the location of the leak and repair the old, damaged, or ineffective part. For example, if you have a cracked hose, replacing it is the most effective way to\u00a0stop your leak. Some components naturally wear out over time. As such, replacing hoses, the\u00a0radiator cap, or the reservoir tank may eventually become necessary on older vehicles.\nYou certainly should keep an eye on hose clamps. With ordinary engine movement, clamps can work their way loose. Checking to see that clamps are always sufficiently tight may prevent a leak from forming in the first place.\nIf your leak is because of something more serious, such as a\u00a0blown head gasket, your fix is not so simple. While replacing a bad head gasket is the best way to go in the longterm, such a replacement is very labor intensive and expensive, and you may be able to use a\u00a0sealant\u00a0for less serious cracks or breaks. Sealant products may also work for holes in the radiator. If you are looking at a costly repair or replacing, trying a sealant first may be the way to go.\n\nFinishing Your\u00a0Project\n\nEven though you may never want to have to deal with a car leaking coolant, the problem is more common than you may think. You cannot ignore coolant leaks or any other issue with your vehicle\u2019s cooling system. Now that you understand how to find and fix coolant leaks, you are ready to tackle your project. To finish it successfully, always choose\u00a0high-quality replacement parts\u00a0and the right coolant for your vehicle. With some planning and a bit of effort, you can stop your vehicle\u2019s coolant leak and extend the life of its engine. \nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How Fuel Injector Cleaner Works",
        "content": "What Does Fuel Cleaner Clean?\n\nMost modern vehicles use fuel injection, a system which uses precision injectors to supply enough gas for the ideal fuel/air ratio in an internal combustion engine. Any issues with a fuel injector can reduce the amount of fuel in the ratio and reduce the efficiency of your vehicle. Over time, a completely clogged fuel cleaner may prevent your vehicle from starting.\nBuildups of various contaminants can occur throughout your vehicle. From your fuel injectors and combustion chamber to your exhaust system, a buildup of by-products is difficult to remove and harmful to the overall fuel economy and performance of your vehicle.\n\nWhat Contaminants Build up in a Fuel System?\n\nNewer vehicles are designed to prevent buildup of contaminants from gasoline. Older vehicles are susceptible to buildup and clogs from two main contaminants: ethanol and carbon. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is an additive used in gasoline. Ethanol is derived from corn, so it\u2019s a renewable fuel source that can boost octane. Early introduction of ethanol was designed to reduce emissions and improve overall air quality, but modern engines no longer need this aspect of ethanol.\nInstead, ethanol is typically used as a cost-saving measure. The alcohol in ethanol is corrosive, so it can oxidize and emulsify into a by-product that isn\u2019t combustible. Over time, this buildup can clog your intake valves and fuel injectors.\nCarbon is another by-product of your engine\u2019s normal operations. Even more than ethanol, carbon deposits can reduce efficiency and clog up your system. Carbon is naturally found in gasoline, but your engine isn\u2019t able to burn 100% of the carbon while it\u2019s running. Most of these carbon deposits make their way out your exhaust system. Some, unfortunately, can remain in your fuel injection system and prevent proper fuel injection.\n\nHow Can You Tell Whether Your Fuel Injector Is Dirty?\n\nYour fuel injector doesn\u2019t necessarily get dirty so much as it can simply become clogged at some point. (No literal dirt or outside debris should be making its way into your engine.) Fuel contains various elements that can leave deposits behind as they pass through the parts of your engine. These deposits build up over time in your fuel system, eventually making it less efficient and affecting your car\u2019s overall performance as a result. How can you know for sure that you\u2019re dealing with a clogged fuel injector and not some other issue? Evaluate your vehicle for the following signs that it\u2019s time for a cleaning.\n\nYour engine has been misfiring, stuttering, lurching, or choking. When fuel injectors become clogged, their ability to properly mix the fuel with air can be affected.\nYour engine stalls or idles in a way that sounds or feels \u201crough\u201d. This is caused by low RPM due to a fuel supply that isn\u2019t flowing smoothly or efficiently.\nYour engine just plain hasn\u2019t been feeling as powerful as it normally does. Anything that gets in the way of proper combustion, up to and including clogged fuel injectors, can result in a noticeable loss of engine power.\nYour gas consumption is on the rise. This is also due to combustion issues that keep fuel from being utilized as well as it normally would be.\nYour vehicle has been failing emission tests. Uneven fuel combustion caused by clogged injectors can easily result in enough harmful emissions for a failing result.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of fuel injector cleaner? It removes the residue that\u2019s clogging up the works so that your car can get back to being reliable and running smoothly again. The more of the above signs you\u2019ve been noticing in your vehicle\u2019s performance lately, the more likely it is that your fuel injector could use a little attention. Keep in mind that this is something that\u2019s eventually necessary for\u202fevery\u202fvehicle, as all fuel injectors become clogged sooner or later.\n\nWhat Does Fuel Injector Cleaner Do?\n\nThe great majority of the cleaners on the market contain chemicals (like polybutene amine, or PBA, to name just one example) that are specially formulated to break down any deposit build-up.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that such cleaners work best when used regularly to not only break up existing deposits, but reduce the likelihood of new deposits forming. How often you should clean your own fuel injector depends on what you drive. Some manufacturers consider a cleaning every 30,000 miles or so to be adequate, but others may suggest one every 15,000 miles or thereabouts instead. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of what most products on the market do for your system:\n\nRid both the nozzles of your fuel injector and your engine\u2019s combustion chamber of troublesome carbon deposits.\nEnhances your vehicle\u2019s ability to burn fuel efficiently, meaning you\u2019ll likely get better gas mileage and enjoy a smoother overall driving experience.\nKeeps your entire fuel system adequately lubricated, minimizing friction and slowing the speed of future deposit buildup.\n\nAs with other parts of your regular vehicle maintenance routine, regularly cleaning your fuel injector will extend the life of your engine and ensure it runs better overall.\n\nHow Often Do Fuel Injectors Need to be Cleaned?\n\nSome individuals choose to use cleaning products with every tank of fuel, while others believe that fuel injection cleaning isn\u2019t necessary. If you\u2019re looking for a general time frame, a good place to start is using fuel system cleaner every 3,000 miles.\nOf course, many factors can affect this timeline. If you are planning on long-term storage for your vehicle, clean the fuel injection system first. A resting vehicle is more likely to experience carbon buildup and emulsifying ethanol.\nIf you drive an older vehicle, you may want to consider cleaning your fuel system more frequently. Older vehicles don\u2019t operate as efficiently and aren\u2019t designed to avoid ethanol buildup, so there\u2019s a greater risk of a clogged fuel system.\n\nHow to Use Fuel Cleaner?\n\nIf your engine is stuttering, vibrating, misfiring or your check engine light turns on, it may be time to use a fuel cleaner. So, how do you use fuel cleaner? Here are the basic steps to effectively using a fuel injector cleaner:\n\n1. Choose Your Cleaner\n\nPurchase your favorite brand of fuel cleaner. If you don\u2019t have a preferred brand, do some research on what cleaners are often used on your make and model of car.\n\n2. Start with an Empty Tank\n\nFor optimal use, be sure your fuel tank is near empty.\n\n3. Read the Instructions\n\nFollow the instructions that came with your fuel cleaning bottle. Add the correct amount of cleaner directly into your fuel tank. You can check your service manual to determine the size of your fuel tank.\n\n4. Top Off\n\nTop off your fuel tank and idle your vehicle briefly before driving as normal.\n\nThese steps generally apply to most fuel cleaner products, but be sure you follow any directions specific to your brand of cleaning product. If your engine is still experiencing stuttering and misfiring, take your vehicle to your local mechanic for a complete inspection. This may be a sign that part of your\u00a0fuel system\u00a0is damaged.\n\nWhat To Consider When\u00a0Choosing a Fuel Injector Cleaner\n\nNot all fuel injector cleaners are created equally. Some are going to be better fits for your needs than others, so it\u2019s important to know what each option brings to the table. Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind as you evaluate your options.\n\nSome products focus on cleaning buildup, while others are better for maintenance purposes. Many products do both. Always thoroughly read product packaging before buying to make sure it\u2019s the best fit for your purposes.\nBe realistic about what you can actually expect from a fuel injector cleaner. A very old vehicle that hasn\u2019t been maintained over the years or a lemon with an engine that\u2019s completely falling apart is likely beyond the help of even the best cleaner.\n\nAt the end of the day, keeping your fuel injectors clean, clear, and functioning properly is all about staying diligent about\u00a0ongoing maintenance. As with many potential engine problems, it\u2019s always much easier to simply stay on top of ongoing concerns than it is to try to reverse a huge problem later on. Your engine (and your wallet) will definitely thank you for it.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "How Does Radiator Stop Leak Work?",
        "content": "What Is Radiator Stop Leak?\nRadiator stop leak is a common additive that is designed to seal minor leaks in your radiator and leaks in-between components. While it\u2019s an aftermarket additive, some car manufacturers use it on new radiators to improve the seal between new radiator components.\nWhile there are a range of radiator stop leak products available, they all use the same basic chemistry. Here are common components found in most radiator stop leak additives:\nCeramic fibers and particlesSodium silicateAluminum, copper and iron particles\nYou won\u2019t necessarily see all of these ingredients in a single radiator stop leak product. Some include other ingredients that target other common radiator issues or assist these particles and fibers in forming a seal. Ask 10 \u201cCar folks\u201d and you are bound to get a 10 different answers on Stop Leak and a myriad of other \u201chomebrew\u201d items to stop a leak \u2013 black pepper, crushed almonds, an egg\u2026.the list goes on and on.\nHow Does It Work?\nEach type of radiator stop leak works in a slightly different way. While the end result is similar, filler particles, ceramic fibers, and sodium silicate all attempt to seal by hardening and solidifying where the leak is occurring. Another area that Stop Leak can help is with your car\u2019s Heater Core. A Heater Core is basically a small radiator inside the cabin of the car, that radiates engine heat for heat in the winter. Heater Cores can suffer leaks similar to a radiator, and are much, much more labor intensive to repair.\nFillers, whether ceramic, metallic, or organic, circulate through your radiator and are forced into the gap in your radiator piping when the system is under pressure. These particles bind and create a temporary seal. Once you flush your coolant or even top off your coolant, you may flush out enough filler to remove the seal and form another pinhole leak.\nInstead, ceramic fibers use what\u2019s called a micro-sphere nano-technology approach to create a more fibrous patch in your radiator. Once heated, these fibers cure and create a semi-permanent seal. It may not be as durable as a brand-new radiator, but it can withstand flushing your coolant without breaking the seal.\nFinally, sodium silicate, also known as liquid glass, melts at around 212 to 221 degrees Fahrenheit. As the liquid circulates your cooling system, it reaches a leak in a hot portion of your engine. Once it reaches the correct temperature, it melts to form hard seal. Sodium silicate requires temperatures up to 1,490 degrees Fahrenheit to melt again, so it creates an extremely strong seal.\nFind out how to use radiator stop leak and when you can effectively use it. Some leaks can\u2019t be effectively sealed with radiator stop leak. In these situations, your radiator needs to be repaired or replaced in order to form a proper seal.\nStop Leak vs. Radiator Repair\nIt\u2019s important to understand that stop-leak is usually only a temporary solution, or a solution to a minor leak. Why is there a leak in your radiator? Stop leak additives may seal the pinhole leak in your radiator, but they may not deal with the source of the damage. Keep in mind, old coolant can encourage corrosion inside your radiator and other parts, so it\u2019s important to service/change/flush your cooling system on a regular interval. Not only will all this corrosion and buildup damage the internal passages of your radiator, it may clog your radiator completely. Most modern radiators are an aluminum core with 2 plastic end tanks on each side. Most failures occur when the tank\u2019s rubber seals corrode and end up seeping antifreeze. On older copper/brass radiators, pinholes were very commons and stop leak was a good sealer.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that many radiator sealers and block sealers require you to complete drain and flush all your coolant, and add the Stop Leak or Block seal with pure water to run for a brief period of time. Be sure to read the instructions thoroughly. An improperly maintained radiator may need to be flushed before you seal it anyways. A single pinhole may be easy to seal, but it also may be a sign that other areas of your radiator are damaged and may soon leak. Flushing your system, as stated before, should be a regular maintenance item.\nWhy Isn\u2019t Stop Leak\u00a0Working?\nWhile stop leak can create a reliable seal in a number of areas in your\u00a0cooling system, there are many situations where it won\u2019t work properly. A bad leak between the end tanks of the radiator, a hose leak, coolant reservoir tank, or water pump are not going to seal. If these parts have a leak, they will need to be replaced. No amount of radiator stop leak can protect these areas from a minor or major leak.\nThese areas can\u2019t be sealed by stop leak, so you\u2019ll need to replace a part to restore a proper seal. No amount of radiator stop leak can protect these areas from a minor or major leak.\nAnother common issue with radiator stop leak is when it forms a complete seal in your radiator. This side effect is typically caused by overuse. Carefully read the directions on your radiator stop leak package. Every company uses a slightly different strength and filler material combination, so it\u2019s essential to only add the precise amount of stop leak necessary and make sure you read whether the mixture can be added to antifreeze, or needs pure water.\nUsing stop leak, particularly an additive that relies on fillers, is a short-term solution at best. Stop by AutoZone to see about finding a\u00a0replacement part\u00a0or more permanent sealing solution to keep your radiator operating effectively.\nWhat Other Stop Leak Options Are Available?\nSimilar to radiator stop leak, there are chemicals made for other systems like AC stop leak, head gasket stop leak and oil stop leak products. These each have their own limitations but can be used as short-term sealants in their relative systems. Just like radiator stop leak,\u202fother stop leak additives can be a good option if you need an emergency seal and can help you avoid replacing a major component for some time, but remember, it\u2019s likely that component will, over time, need replacement.\nWhere Can I Buy Radiator Stop Leak?\nNow that you know how to use radiator stop leak and how it works, you might wonder, \u201cWhat is the best radiator stop leak?\u201d There are a number of name-brand radiator stop leak products on the market. The best option depends on your vehicle and your particular leak, so shop for stop leak additives at your local AutoZone to compare options.",

        "title": "What Fuel Stabilizer Is and How to Use It",
        "content": "What\u2019s the Big Deal with\u00a0Expired Gasoline?\n\nThe scary news is that expired gasoline can potentially ruin your engine entirely. If you leave fuel sitting in the tank unused for more than a couple of months, you are risking it compromising the internals of your fuel tank, which will cause you no end of problems the next time you try to fire up your machine.\nEven worse, if the gas sits in the car for more than 6 months, it can completely ruin the\u00a0carburetor. If this happens, you\u2019ll have to deconstruct the carburetor, clean it up, and put the engine back together again. It\u2019s a major hassle, and let\u2019s face it: when the weather warms, you\u2019d rather be out cruising than reconstructing your carburetor.\nHowever, the good news is that there is a quick, easy, and inexpensive way to fix this problem. You can use a\u00a0fuel stabilizer\u00a0to ensure that the fuel does not cause damage to your precious automobile.\n\nWhat is\u00a0Fuel Stabilizer?\n\nIf you are wondering, \u201cWhat does fuel stabilizer do?\u201d, fuel stabilizer is a substance that is specifically made to help the gasoline in your tank not corrode the engine. Basically, it\u2019s an anti-expiry solution that will keep the gasoline fresh for longer than it would be otherwise. Most fuel stabilizer solutions will protect the engine for at least 24 months, which is considerably than any winters we\u2019ve seen.\nIn the event that you need to store your vehicle for longer than this, you\u2019ll need to drain the engine. However, if you\u2019re just storing your vehicle for a couple of months or a season, this is a messy endeavor and best avoided. It\u2019s much easier just to put a measure of fuel stabilizer in your tank when you\u2019re looking to store the car and you can forget about it until the next year. (And, hey, your car will already have some fuel to get it started.)\n\nHow to\u00a0Use Fuel Stabilizer\n\nFortunately, using fuel stabilizer is a simple, DIY-friendly procedure, even for those who don\u2019t own any tools. So long as you can access your gasoline tank (we hope you can), you\u2019re good to use fuel stabilizer. The first thing you will want to ensure is that you are running your tank on nearly empty.\nAt this point, all you need to do is open the fuel tank, measure out the amount of stabilizer that is recommended by the fuel stabilizer manufacturer, and then pour this into the gas tank.\nIt is a good idea to top off your tank at this point. If you can go with a gas that does not have ethanol, this is best. Filling your tank will help minimize the chance that the\u00a0fuel system\u00a0of your car is exposed to air or water.\nYou\u2019ll need to turn the engine on for a few moments to let the gasoline move through it and ensure that the fuel stabilizer solution is evenly distributed throughout the tank. Typically, you aren\u2019t going to need to run the engine for more than 5-10 minutes. Assuming that you are driving the car home from the gas station, that is probably enough time.\nAfter this, you\u2019re finished! Again, no tools required, and it is absolutely worth taking a few minutes before storing your vehicle to protect your engine from corrosion.\n\nDoes Fuel Stabilizer\u00a0Only Work on Cars?\n\nYou can use fuel stabilizer on anything that has an engine. In addition to storing cars, you can also use it to help protect lawn mowers, snowmobiles, or even generators. If it has a gasoline engine and you are looking to store it, it is highly likely that you will be able to use fuel stabilizer to protect it.",

        "title": "How to Check Your Brake Fluid",
        "content": "Importance of Checking Your Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nLow brake fluid can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of your brake system. If you experience a spongy feeling while pressing your brake pedal, or your\u202fbrakes aren\u2019t working efficiently, it\u2019s time to check your brake fluid. Low or contaminated fluid can cause your brakes to fail while you\u2019re on the road, so check your fluid today and find out if you need more brake fluid.\u00a0\nThere is a range of related brake components that could be causing your brake fluid level to drop, so it\u2019s a good idea to inspect your entire brake system. If you refill your brake fluid and it doesn\u2019t solve your braking issue, inspect your brake pads, rotors, calipers, and brake lines for any signs of damage, extreme wear, or leaking brake fluid.\u00a0\n\nSigns of Low Brake Fluid\n\nThe hydraulic part of the braking system is closed, meaning that the fluid is not consumed and won\u2019t dissipate under normal circumstances. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be variances in the fluid level, though. One of the leading causes of low brake fluid is brake pad or shoe wear since more fluid is required in the lines to extend the calipers and wheel cylinders to stop your car. However, low fluid more often indicates a leak somewhere. No matter why its low, symptoms are usually similar and can include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe brake pedal sinks lower to the floor than normal when applied.\u00a0\nA spongy or inconsistent pedal feel.\u00a0\nLonger stopping distances.\u00a0\nA brake warning light is on.\u00a0\n\nPulling to one side when stopping.\u00a0\n\nSimply knowing how to check brake fluid and topping it up can resolve some of these symptoms immediately.\u00a0\n\nChecking the Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nWhen you\u2019re testing brake fluid, what are you looking for? Primarily, ensure the brake fluid level is between the minimum and maximum lines on the reservoir. If it\u2019s low, add fluid of the same type; you will see the specification stamped on the brake fluid reservoir cap. Secondly, check the condition. The fluid should be nearly clear or honey brown. If it\u2019s dark brown or black, it\u2019s overdue for a brake fluid flush.\u00a0\n\nWhere Is the Brake Fluid Located?\u00a0\n\nTo check your brake fluid, you first need to find the brake master cylinder reservoir. This reservoir is typically a plastic canister that is mounted near the firewall at the rear of the engine compartment. It\u2019s usually near the driver\u2019s side\u202fbrake booster, near the brake pedal.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re having trouble finding your\u202fbrake master cylinder reservoir, consult your owner\u2019s manual. Most reservoirs in vehicles newer than the 1980s are made of translucent plastic and have a line visible on the exterior of the reservoir to indicate the fluid level.\u00a0\nOlder vehicles have a metal reservoir with a clamp securing the lid. If you have an older vehicle and an\u202fanti-lock braking system, check your owner\u2019s manual for more information. When you\u2019re ready to open it, thoroughly clean off the lid before using a screwdriver to pry open the clamp and open the lid. You should see a fluid line on the interior of the reservoir.\u00a0\nWhen you need to open your brake master cylinder reservoir to check brake fluid, be sure you have everything prepared beforehand. Exposure to moist air can compromise your brake fluid. This can happen if you leave your brake fluid container open for too long. Depending on your climate and air quality, exposed brake fluid can be compromised in as little as 15 minutes. Keep your brake fluid container and master cylinder reservoir sealed as much as possible.\u00a0\n\nInspect the Fluid Level and Color\u00a0\n\nCheck to see that your brake fluid level is up to the recommended fill line. If it isn\u2019t, you may need to refill your brake fluid. However, low brake fluid can also be caused by worn-out brake pads. This is because, with thin brake pads, the caliper piston will need to go a little farther in, lowering the fluid level in the reservoir.\u00a0\nIf you see a low brake fluid level, inspect your brake pads or ask a professional mechanic to perform a\u202fbrake pad replacement. After your brake pads are replaced, then you can inspect your fluid level again and determine whether you need to top off your brake fluid or not.\u00a0\nEven if the brake fluid is at the correct level, inspect the color of your brake fluid. Dark fluid could have dirt and other contaminants in it. As dirt enters the system, or as your brake fluid breaks down over time, it becomes less efficient. This can begin to damage your hydraulic components, causing exponential damage and decreasing the efficiency of your brake system.\u00a0\n\nChecking for Leaks\u00a0\n\nIf your reservoir was empty or close to it, there\u2019s a great chance that you have a brake fluid leak. Inspect the brake system at every point to determine where the fluid is leaking from, then fix it right away. Applying pressure to the brake pedal while someone is watching the brake system can easily identify the area with a drip or spray from the problem area.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCommon Causes of Low Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nLow brake wear material is the most common cause of low fluid. Other issues that can cause the condition could be:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA leaking brake caliper piston.\u00a0\nA corroded or pinched steel brake line.\u00a0\nA worn or cracked brake hose.\u00a0\nA loose fitting or joint.\u00a0\nAlthough rare, a seal leaking fluid from the master cylinder to the brake booster.\n\nHow to Add Brake Fluid\u00a0\n\nAs a general guide, consider replacing your brake fluid every two years. This will promote efficient use and keep your brake system operating safely for years to come. Choose the exact brake fluid recommended by your owner\u2019s manual or an experienced mechanic. Mixing brake fluid, using the incorrect formula, or overfilling your brake master cylinder reservoir can cause damage to your vehicle and prevent your brakes from working properly.\u00a0\n\nIf you need to top off your brake master cylinder reservoir, purchase the correct brake fluid and gather your safety gear. Brake fluid can be toxic and is highly corrosive, so you\u2019ll need to ensure that it doesn\u2019t come in contact with your skin, eyes, or any painted part of your vehicle. Any rags with large amounts of brake fluid should be disposed of at your local hazardous waste center.\u00a0\nAfter topping off your reservoir, simply replace the cap and test your brakes. Your brake system should be operating effectively. If you need to bleed your brakes and replace the brake fluid instead of simply adding more, consult your owner\u2019s manual and your local auto mechanic. Replacing fluid requires you to bleed the lines and refill your brake lines and master cylinder reservoir while removing any trapped air.\u00a0\n\nWe Can Help\n\nIf you are unable to check brake fluid on your own, or you think there may be a leak in your system, don\u2019t hesitate to contact a local AutoZone store. We\u2019ll discuss the right brake fluid for your vehicle and help you find the parts you need to restore your brakes and keep your vehicle operating safely.\u00a0\nIf you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\u202f\u00a0\n\nFrequently Asked Question",

        "title": "How to Upgrade Performance",
        "content": "How to Upgrade to a High Performance\n\n1. Upgrade the Engine\n\nThe first thing you want to do is to look at your engine as a big air pump. The faster and better the air flows through the engine, the faster your car will move. One great upgrade that can help achieve this is a cold air intake system. Brands like Specter and K&N offer high-performance systems that replace the factory air filter and intake housing. This design reduces intake restrictions and allows for a larger amount of air to flow into the engine, resulting in more usable power and better acceleration.\n\n2. Upgrade the Exhaust System\n\nAnother way to increase horsepower is to improve the performance and sound of your exhaust system. Replacing the factory mufflers with high-flow performance mufflers from Flow Master or Magna Flow can make a significant difference. If you\u2019re not comfortable with cutting and welding, a local muffler shop can help with the installation. Another option is a cat-back exhaust system that replaces the factory system from the catalytic converters to the rear of the car. This upgrade can be done with simple hand tools and provides real performance gains.\nA full performance exhaust system can also free up some horsepower. There are two options to choose from \u2013 a bolt-on kit designed to fit your car or a universal kit from Flow Master that you can customize to fit your vehicle. The full system includes mandrel bends to reduce resistance and an option for a crossover pipe or an X pipe for scavenging. You can also choose the performance muffler that best suits your performance goals or desired sound. This is a heavy DIY project that requires cutting and welding, so a local exhaust shop can help if you\u2019re not comfortable with your skills.\n\n3. Upgrade the brakes\n\nIf you want a car that goes fast, then you better make sure it can stop fast, and upgrading your brakes is something that most of us can do. For performance, you want to look at your pads, calipers, and your rotors. And if you want a little extra flare, you can use some custom caliper covers, or go on to the full brake kit.\n\n4. Upgrade Tires & Handling\n\nYou have got to be able to control your car, especially when it\u2019s screaming at the top of its RPM range. You can really improve the handling with some performance tires, and you can get better feedback with a performance steering wheel. Most stock steering wheels are typically a larger diameter; they\u2019re made from molded plastic, and they can be hard to hang on to in extreme conditions. A smaller diameter wheel, covered in leather or suede give you better feedback, a better grip, and better car control.\n\n5. Upgrade fluids and chemicals\n\nHigh performance means high heat, and if you\u2019re dealing with high heat, you\u2019ve got to go with synthetic. One of the best benefits of synthetic oil is that the oil itself doesn\u2019t break down as fast. The viscosity stays the same for a longer period of time, and especially under extreme conditions. But it\u2019s not just your engine oil. Synthetic and performance fluids throughout your vehicle can free up horsepower with less friction, and better protect your parts under stress, all at the same time. \n\n6. Reprogram the system\n\nPower programmers are a simple and proven way to really wake up your car, providing power gains up to 30 horsepower or even more in some diesel applications. They use a data cable that connects the programmer to your car\u2019s computer by plugging into the car\u2019s diagnostic port of a \u201996 and newer vehicle. A programmer can access and change tuning data that controls air and fuel into your engine, timing events, even transmission shift points, and line pressures to give you more power and a better performance feel, better towing, and even better fuel economy, depending on how the programmer is set.",

        "content": "What to Use Sea Foam Motor Treatment For\n\n1. Using Sea Foam For Maintenance\n\nIf you\u2019re regularly adding Sea Foam and looking to maintain a clean engine, Sea Foam recommends a low dose of just 1 ounce per gallon of fuel. One pint will treat a full tank of up to 16 gallons. Just pour the Sea Foam directly into your gas tank.\n\n2. Using Sea Foam For Cleaning\n\nCarbon build up on engine valves, pistons and combustion chambers rob an engine of performance and fuel economy. Sea Foam will reduce the amount of carbon build up on these components. When cleaning is your goal, Sea Foam recommends a higher concentration. You can add Sea Foam to a low tank to get the most out of your treatment. If you think you\u2019ve added too much, just add more fuel to dilute. Your engine will still be safe. For cleaning, shoot for a concentration between 2 ounces of Sea Foam per gallon of fuel, or as high as a 50/50 Sea Foam to fuel mix ratio.",

        "content": "What Head Gasket Sealants Do\n\nThese sealants are designed to fix head gasket failures, but using a sealant isn\u2019t the only way to address a failure. You can use a torque wrench to tighten the cylinder head bolts or change the head gasket altogether. Because the the head gasket is between the cylinder head and the engine block, replacing it can be complicated and require disassembling major engine components. Using a head gasket sealant is the easiest fix. This liquid stop leak is made to track down the source of a leak and fix it quickly so you can get back behind the wheel in less than an hour.\n\nSigns of a Blown Head Gasket\n\nA mayonnaise- or milk-like mixture in the oil: An off-white creamy appearance on the dipstick signals that the coolant has probably mixed with the oil. This can also be caused by a leaking intake manifold gasket. If the intake gasket is OK, consider changing the oil and replacing the head gasket(s) altogether\nUnresponsive engine: One of the most common signs of a head gasket approaching failure is a slow or unresponsive engine\nWhite smoke coming from the exhaust pipe: White smoke can show water from the coolant is leaking into the combustion chamber\nBlue smoke coming from the exhaust pipe: Blue smoke often signals oil is leaking into the combustion chamber\n\nUsing head gasket sealant is relatively easy.

        "title": "What is Brake Fluid and How Does it Work?",
        "content": "Introduction to Brake Fluid\n\nBrake fluid is a hydraulic fluid specifically designed to operate in the high-stress environment of a braking system. Its primary role is to transmit the force applied to the brake pedal by the driver to the brake components at each wheel, bringing your vehicle to a stop. Without brake fluid, the entire braking process would be compromised, posing a severe threat to both the occupants of the vehicle and others on the road.\nAlong with its use in hydraulic function, brake fluid also prevents brake systems from corroding from the inside. It\u2019s hygroscopic, meaning that it attracts and absorbs water molecules, trapping them so they can\u2019t corrode the inside of lines, calipers, proportioning valves, and more.\n\nEvolution of Brake Fluid Technology\n\nThe history of brake fluid is a testament to the relentless pursuit of safety and performance in the automotive industry. Early brake systems used plain water as a hydraulic fluid, but this wasn\u2019t very effective due to freezing and corrosion. Over time, automotive engineers developed specialized brake fluids that could withstand the demanding conditions within the braking system.\nAdvancements in brake fluid technology led to the introduction of glycol-based fluids, commonly known as DOT (Department of Transportation) brake fluids. These fluids, categorized as DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1, offer improved boiling points and better overall performance compared to their predecessors.\n\nHow Brake Fluid Works\n\nTo comprehend how brake fluid works, you need to delve into the science of hydraulic systems. The braking system in modern vehicles is predominantly a hydraulic system, where force is transmitted through a fluid that\u2019s difficult to compress \u2013 in this case, brake fluid. When you press the brake pedal, it activates a piston in the master cylinder, which then forces brake fluid through a series of brake lines.\nAs the pressurized brake fluid reaches the brake calipers or wheel cylinders at each wheel, it exerts force on the brake pads or shoes. This force then makes them squeeze against the brake rotors or drums, creating the friction necessary to slow down or stop the vehicle.\n\nTypes of Brake Fluid\n\nThere are various types of brake fluid available, with DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5 being the most common. These are the glycol-based varieties, and each type has distinct characteristics and is designed for specific applications.\n\nDOT 3 \u2013 Widely used in everyday vehicles, DOT 3 brake fluid has a lower boiling point compared to DOT 4 and DOT 5.1. Its dry boiling point, meaning new and uncontaminated, is 401 F whereas the wet boiling point is 284 F.\u00a0 It\u2019s compatible with most brake systems but may require more frequent replacement.\nDOT 4 \u2013DOT 4 brake fluid is often found in vehicles with more demanding braking conditions, such as those with performance features or towing capabilities. It offers a higher boiling point of 446 F dry and 311 F wet.\nDOT 5.1 \u2013 Similar to DOT 4 but with an even higher boiling point of 500 F dry and 356 F wet, DOT 5.1 brake fluid is suitable for high-performance vehicles and heavy-duty applications. It is glycol-based, like DOT 3 and DOT 4.\nDOT 5 \u2013 Unlike DOT 3, DOT 4, and DOT 5.1, DOT 5 brake fluid is silicone-based. It does not absorb water, making it ideal for certain applications, but it\u2019s crucial to note that it is not compatible with other types of brake fluid. Its boiling point? The same as DOT 5.1.\n\nSelecting the appropriate brake fluid for your vehicle is crucial for optimal braking performance and safety. The recommended type of brake fluid will be found in your owner\u2019s manual, and it might be printed on the brake fluid reservoir cap too. Mixing different types of brake fluid isn\u2019t a good idea as it can compromise the fluid\u2019s properties and, consequently, cause issues with the braking system prematurely.\n\nMaintenance Tips\n\nRegular maintenance of your vehicle\u2019s brake fluid is essential to ensure your braking system continues to work as it should. Here are some signs that your brake fluid may need attention:\n\nThe brake fluid level is low \u2013 Check the brake fluid reservoir regularly and ensure it is between the minimum and maximum levels. There may be a leak present.\nThe fluid is discolored \u2013 Brake fluid should be clear or slightly yellow. If it appears dark or murky, it may indicate contamination and the need for a fluid flush.\nThe brake pedal is spongy \u2013 A soft or spongy brake pedal could indicate air or moisture in the brake fluid, affecting its performance.\nA brake warning light is on \u2013 Some vehicles have warning lights that illuminate when there is an issue with the brake fluid level or pressure. Pay attention to these warnings and address them promptly.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How Does the Steering System Work?",
        "content": "Understanding the Basics of Steering Systems\n\nThe steering system of a car is responsible for translating your input at the steering wheel into the necessary movements to control the direction of your vehicle. It is a complex mechanism that combines different components and technologies to make driving a breeze.\nTwo primary types of steering systems are commonly found in vehicles: the rack and pinion system and the recirculating ball system. Understanding the difference between these two is the first step to comprehending how your car\u2019s steering operates.\n\nRack and pinion \u2013 This system is prevalent in most modern cars due to its efficient and compact design. It consists of a steering column connected to a horizontal rod, which is know as the rack, that moves left or right. The rack engages with a pinion gear, and as the steering wheel turns, the rack moves, causing the car\u2019s wheels to turn accordingly. It\u2019s a direct and responsive system that offers precise control.\nRecirculating ball \u2013 This system, which was more common in older vehicles, uses a worm gear and recirculating ball bearings to convert the motion of the steering wheel into the movement of the wheels. While not as precise as rack and pinion, it\u2019s known for its durability and ability to handle heavy loads, making it suitable for trucks and larger vehicles.\n\nThe steering system is comprised of several crucial components, each with its own unique role in ensuring smooth and precise control of your vehicle. These key components include:\n\nSteering Wheel \u2013 Your connection to the system, where you apply the necessary force and input to steer the vehicle.\nSteering Column \u2013 The shaft that connects the steering wheel to the steering box or rack and pinion.\nSteering box or rack and pinion \u2013 The mechanism responsible for translating your steering wheel input into motion at the wheels.\nTie rods \u2013 These connect the steering system to the wheels, allowing the actual turning of the wheels.\nSuspension system \u2013 The system that holds and supports the wheels while ensuring a smooth ride.\n\nThere are also hydraulic hoses, a power steering pump, and other components that relate to the system too, depending on the design.\n\nThe Mechanics of Steering: A Step-By-Step Guide\n\nWhen you turn the steering wheel, it rotates the steering column. This column, in turn, moves the steering box or rack and pinion. As the steering box or rack and pinion moves, it causes the tie rods to push or pull the wheels, making them turn left or right, aligning the car\u2019s direction with your input.\nPower steering is a technological advancement that eases the effort required to turn the steering wheel, especially at low speeds. There are two main types of power steering systems: hydraulic and electric.\n\nHydraulic power steering uses hydraulic fluid and a pump to assist in steering. When you turn the wheel, the pump pressurizes the fluid, making it easier to turn the wheels. This system is widely used in older cars and some newer ones, offering a more traditional and responsive feel.\n\nElectric power steering is common on modern vehicles. They use an electric motor to provide assistance, making it more energy-efficient and flexible. Electric power steering adjusts its assistance level based on driving conditions, providing a smoother driving experience.\n\nTypes of Steering Systems and How They Operate\nHydraulic power steering relies on the power of hydraulic fluid to enhance the steering experience. When you turn the steering wheel, the hydraulic pump pressurizes the fluid, transmitting this force to the steering gear. The fluid pressure assists in turning the wheels with less effort, reducing driver fatigue and improving responsiveness. Regular maintenance, including fluid checks and replacements, is crucial to keep this system running smoothly.\nElectric power steering is a cutting-edge technology that offers several advantages. This system uses sensors to monitor your steering input and the car\u2019s speed, adjusting the amount of assistance needed. It\u2019s more energy-efficient than hydraulic power steering, as it only operates when necessary, reducing the load on the engine and improving fuel efficiency. Maintenance for electric power steering mainly involves ensuring the electrical components are in good condition.\n\nThe Importance of Steering System Maintenance\n\nRegular maintenance is vital to ensure your car\u2019s steering system operates flawlessly. Look out for signs of steering problems, such as:\n\nUnusual noises when turning the wheel like droning or whining.\nDifficulty turning the wheel, especially at low speeds.\nVibrations or a shaky steering wheel.\nFluid leaks or low power steering fluid levels.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, it\u2019s essential to diagnose and repair it right away to avoid potential safety hazards.\nWhile some maintenance tasks should be left to professionals and experienced DIYers, there are a few tasks you can perform to keep your steering system in top shape. These include checking power steering fluid levels and inspecting the condition of belts and hoses. Regularly examining the steering system can help you catch potential issues early and save on repair costs.\n\nSteering System Upgrades and Modifications\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to enhance your vehicle\u2019s performance, consider upgrading your steering system. Performance steering systems offer improved responsiveness and control, making your driving experience more enjoyable. Upgrades may include stiffer steering components or precision steering racks, which provide better feedback and control.\nIn addition to upgrading your steering system, you can also customize your steering wheel. A custom steering wheel not only adds a touch of personal style to your car but can also improve your grip and control. These modifications are not only functional but also enhance the aesthetics of your vehicle.\nIn conclusion, understanding how the steering system works is essential for any car owner. Whether you drive a modern vehicle with electric power steering or an older one with hydraulic power steering, knowing the basics and the key components can help you troubleshoot issues, perform maintenance, and make informed decisions about upgrades.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Why is My Steering Wheel Hard to Turn?",
        "content": "Causes of a Hard-to-Turn Steering Wheel\n\nBefore we delve into specific culprits, it\u2019s essential to understand the general causes of a hard-to-turn steering wheel. Several factors can lead to this issue, and recognizing these can help you determine the root of the problem. The most common reasons include:\n\nLow power steering fluid\nFaulty power steering pump\nWorn or misaligned belt\nSteering system issues\nFuses or electrical problems\n\nNow, let\u2019s examine each of these causes in more detail.\n\nLow Power Steering Fluid\n\nOne of the most frequent reasons for a hard-to-turn steering wheel is low power steering fluid. Power steering fluid is the lifeblood of your vehicle\u2019s power steering system, providing hydraulic assistance to make turning the wheel easier. When the fluid level drops too low, the steering wheel may feel tight and resistant. There may not be enough fluid to be pressurized in the lines from the pump, reducing or completely preventing steering assist.\nTo check your power steering fluid, locate the reservoir under the hood. It\u2019s typically labeled and has a dipstick or markings to indicate the fluid level. If it\u2019s low, top it up with the manufacturer-recommended fluid. Be cautious not to overfill, as this can also lead to issues.\n\nFaulty Power Steering Pump\n\nThe power steering pump is responsible for pressurizing the power steering fluid, allowing for smooth and effortless turning of the wheel. If the power steering pump is failing or has issues, it can lead to a hard-to-turn steering wheel. Even with enough fluid present, it cannot create the pressure needed to reduce your steering effort.\nSigns of a faulty power steering pump include a whining or groaning noise when turning the wheel and increased effort required to steer. In extreme cases, it can even cause the belt to squeal or break. In such cases, inspect and, if necessary, replace the power steering pump.\n\nWorn or Misaligned Belt\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s engine relies on belts to operate various components, and the power steering system is no exception. If the belt responsible for driving the power steering pump is worn or misaligned, it can lead to steering difficulties. A loose or slipping belt won\u2019t allow the pump to spin at a high enough rate to provide efficient assist, resulting in a stiff steering wheel.\nRegular maintenance and belt inspections can help prevent this issue. If you notice any issues with the power steering belt like glazing, cracking, or missing pieces, it\u2019s essential to address them promptly to maintain optimal steering performance.\n\nSteering System Issues\n\nSometimes, the issue may go beyond power steering fluid, the pump, or the belt. Problems within the steering system itself can make the steering wheel hard to turn. These issues can range from worn-out steering components to damaged tie rods, steering racks, struts, or even misaligned wheels.\nIf you suspect that the problem lies within the steering system, check for the proper movement in each of the components. If there\u2019s excessive play or binding in any of them, replace them and re-check for the symptom.\n\nElectrical Concerns\n\nMany modern power steering systems use an electric motor on the steering rack or column to provide assist rather than a hydraulic system. If the electric motor is failing, steering sensors have issues, there\u2019s a broken wire or corrosion, or the fuse is blown, you may be left with no power steering assist.\nSince steering calibration is typically required after a repair to the electric power steering system, it\u2019s usually best left to the professionals. If you decide to tackle the repair on your own, ensure you have any calibrations done before operating your car on the road.\nIf you\u2019re ever faced with the question, \u201cWhy is my steering wheel hard to turn?\u201d, remember to consider these common reasons and take action. Regular maintenance and attentive care of your vehicle\u2019s power steering system can go a long way in ensuring a smooth and effortless driving experience.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

Or, fluid leaking onto the belt can cause similar noise.\n\nTools and Equipment Needed\n\nTo change a power steering pump, you will need some or all of the following tools:\u00a0\n\nReplacement power steering pump\u00a0\nPower steering fluid\u00a0\nSocket wrench set and various sockets\u00a0\nWrench set\u00a0\nPower steering pulley remover and installer kit\u00a0\nPower steering hose remover tool\u00a0\nDrain pan\u00a0\nJack and jack stands or car ramps\u00a0\nTorque wrench\u00a0\n\nStep-By-Step Guide to Replacing a Power Steering Pump\n\nEvery model will be designed differently for the exact process of how to replace the power steering pump, but the general steps will be similar. Consult a service manual for a precise walkthrough.\n\n1. Drain the power steering fluid\n\nThe power steering system is filled with fluid used to create hydraulic pressure, and it needs to be drained. Find a low spot on the system, typically a power steering cooler line, and remove it, draining it into a drain pan. Discard the fluid safely.\n\n2. Remove the old power steering pump\n\nRemove the tension on your power steering belt, whether it\u2019s a V-belt or a serpentine belt, then slip it off the pulley. Remove the bolts holding the pump in place, then pull it away to access the hoses attached to it. Disconnect the hoses, either using wrenches or a hose remover tool as required. The old pump should now be free.\n\n3. Transfer the pump pulley\n\nIf your new power steering pump isn\u2019t equipped with a pulley, you\u2019ll need to transfer the pulley from the old one. A power steering pulley remover and installer kit works wonders.\n\n4. Install the new power steering pump\n\nWith the pulley in place, it\u2019s time to install the new pump. It\u2019s essentially the reverse order of removal. Begin by installing hoses that can\u2019t be accessed when the pump is installed already. Then, mount the pump in the same orientation as the old one, tightening the bolts using the torque spec in your service manual. Make any additional connections that remain, then install the drive belt.\n\n5. Refill the power steering fluid\n\nAdd fluid to the power steering pump reservoir using a fresh, sealed container of power steering fluid compatible with your vehicle. There will be air in the lines, so it\u2019s important to purge it. With the engine off, turn the steering wheel left and right to the stops a few times, helping to work any bubbles free. Then, start the engine and turn the wheel to the stops again, feeling for smooth, consistent operation. Then, a test drive is in order.\n\nHelpful Tips\n\nWhen you\u2019re replacing the power steering pump, you can encounter hiccups along the way sometimes. These tips can help it go easier:\n\nSpray fasteners with penetrating oil to help them get free, preventing the frustration and work related to broken bolts.\nBorrow purpose-built tools from AutoZone\u2019s Loan-a-Tool program rather than buying a set you might never use again. It makes the job go much faster than trying to make do with the wrong tools.\nLubricate the power steering pulley shaft before installing the pulley so it goes on straight.\n\nSafety Precautions\n\nAs you change the steering pump, be sure to let the engine cool sufficiently to prevent burns. The steering fluid can get hot also, so make sure the pump can be handled comfortably before disconnecting lines.\nIf you need to lift your vehicle, use a floor jack and stands to secure it.\nAlso, avoid getting power steering fluid on belts since it can make them oil-soaked and prone to premature failure. When you\u2019re re-installing your belt, a belt tension gauge can help ensure you don\u2019t get belt squeal or damage to the belt.",

If something doesn\u2019t line up when the computer collects this information, it will turn on the warning light. Often, you can fix the problem by pulling off the road, shutting the car off, and letting it sit for a minute. When you turn the car back on, the system will reset itself.

        "title": "Bad Power Steering Pump: Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Before diving into the specifics of the power steering pump replacement, it is necessary to understand the equipment, symptoms, and safety concerns. As an integral steering component, it is unwise to drive with a failing pump, but how do you know when it is time to replace the part? Also, are you only going to need to replace this part once in the lifetime of your vehicle? The power steering pump is an intricate engine component, and while you may not be able to identify it now, by the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the purpose of this part and when to replace it. Also, you will understand how the cost of a replacement is broken down, and whether you can save money or not.\n\nUnderstanding the Power Steering Pump\n\nWhat is a power steering pump? Most classic cars did not have power steering, which meant they were harder to turn and control. As steering systems evolved, engineers found ways to ease the steering process using hydraulics. The power steering pump is a critical component of the hydraulic system. The pump circulates and pressurizes power steering fluid. When the pressurized fluid is transferred through a hose to the steering pump, it is used to help turn the wheel. As the wheel turns, another hose returns the fluid back through the pump, where it is pressurized again. The process is continuous while the engine is running, meaning that you are never left without steering assistance. Since most drivers own vehicles equipped with power steering, it quickly becomes obvious when the pump is failing because of\u00a0power steering problems like a hard to turn wheel.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad Power Steering Pump\n\n1. Fluid Leaks\n\nOne of the most common signs of pump failure is a fluid leak. Power steering fluid is a red or reddish-brown color. Check for puddles after driving. While a leak is not a definitive sign of a bad pump, it does signal that there is something wrong with the system.\n\n2. Noises\n\nNext, you may hear the power steering pump making strange noises. If you hear groaning, whining or screeching noises when you turn the wheel or increase engine RPMs, then your power steering pump may be going bad. The pump is driven by a belt, which also can result in strange sounds, so check your belt as well.\n\n3. Hard to Turn Steering Wheel\n\nFinally, as the pump goes bad, you will notice an increased difficulty when turning your car. You will likely struggle the most when going slow or stopped.\n\nSafety and Caution\n\nIf you hear a power steering pump noise or suspect an issue with the system, it is best to have your vehicle towed to a safe location, like your garage or a repair shop. While it is technically safe to drive a car with a leaking power steering pump, you must keep in mind the risk of doing so. If the leak is faster than you expect, then you risk damaging the power steering system. Permanent damage is a risk, which is why it is better to err on the side of caution. Do not drive a vehicle you think has a pump issue. Call for a tow. It is always better to be safe than sorry. While it is best to repair the problem quickly, you may be able to save a few bucks doing the repair yourself, but only if you have the skill set.\n\nCost of Replacement\n\nIt is difficult to specify an exact cost because the price of a replacement part varies based on vehicle make and model. The estimate for the entire pump replacement is $100 to $200 for parts. If you are handy, then you may be able to save around $300, which is a likely cost for labor. Again, these estimates are rough because even labor costs can vary from place to place. While it is tempting to save some money and do the job yourself, keep in mind that a pump repair is likely part of a larger project, requiring a more advanced skill set. You may be able to find a cheaper part and then pay someone to install it, but that depends on the shop.\n\nFrequency of Replacement\n\nMost vehicle components have an expected lifespan, and power steering pumps are no different. A pump typically lasts up to 100,000 miles or better before experiencing any significant issues. However, much of that longevity has to do with maintaining a proper maintenance schedule.\nBecause steering pumps last so long, any repair work is usually found in used vehicles, especially because of how many car owners lease. Although, that does not mean that a younger model won\u2019t experience unexpected failure or problems. Always be mindful of the symptoms and signs of a failing pump, so you can avoid significant harm to your car\u2019s steering system.",

        "title": "When to Change Your Power Steering Fluid",
        "content": "Power Steering Fluid\u2019s\u00a0Purpose\n\nAnyone who has ever experienced difficulty turning the wheel of a car with no power steering knows how frustrating it can be. Making a tight turn or trying to turn the wheel quickly (in the case of making a left-hand turn at a traffic light in front of traffic, for example) can especially be a pain.\nKeeping the power steering fluid in your vehicle will simplify turning the wheel in these situations. Absence of power steering fluid prevents your power steering from working and could make it difficult to sufficiently turn the wheel in a moment of need.\nIt\u2019s also important for the health of the steering system and the vehicle as a whole. Power steering fluid keeps components such as pistons, valves, hoses, and the\u00a0power steering pumps\u00a0functioning seamlessly and effectively. This hydraulic fluid protects O-rings and seals as well.\n\nWhat Happens if You\u00a0Neglect It?\n\nIf your vehicle runs out of fluid and you don\u2019t replace it, other parts and areas of the car can suffer. Pieces of the steering system may wear out or corrode. This could leave broken parts and debris moving around in the vehicle.\nIf you fail to replace the fluid regularly, it could eventually lead to a total break-down of your car. The last thing you want is to find yourself in the middle of nowhere with an inoperable vehicle because you never changed the power steering fluid.\n\nTime Isn\u2019t Kind\n\nAs with any other car part, system, or component, power steering fluid won\u2019t function well forever. Over time, the fluid will break down and become contaminated with particles. This could harm the pump and other parts of the\u00a0steering system. Replacing the fluid and getting a power steering flush will help prevent these issues from occurring and affecting the car\u2019s performance.\n\nSigns That Your Car Needs a Fluid Change:\u00a0You Hear Noises\n\nKnowing when to change power steering fluid doesn\u2019t have to be guesswork. Like other car issues, you can sometimes detect\u00a0power steering problems\u00a0by using your ears. The power steering pump could be the biggest indicator that the vehicle needs more fluid in this area, as the pump controls the fluid.\nAs the fluid starts to break down, the pump will let you know about it. Low fluid makes it more difficult for the pump to do its job efficiently. As it works hard, it will begin to make strange sounds. Of course, odd noises coming from the car could indicate many problems. Your best bet is to head to a mechanic you trust for an inspection.\n\nA\u00a0Tug\u00a0at the Wheel\n\nIf a sound doesn\u2019t clue you in that it\u2019s time to change the fluid, a feeling could. If you drive and notice that the wheel tugs, it\u2019s probably time to do a power steering flush. This symptom may present as difficulty turning the wheel. A well-regulated power steering system should make operating the wheel almost effortless. If you have to put forth more effort than usual, there\u2019s likely a problem with the fluid levels. Take your vehicle to a mechanic to top off the fluid or flush the system.\n\nTake a\u00a0Look at It\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to rely solely on sounds or feelings to decide whether you need more power steering fluid in the vehicle. Deciding a replacement or flush is right could be as simple as checking the fluid yourself.\nOpen the hood of the vehicle and locate the power steering fluid reservoir. Open the cap and check out the level and color of the fluid. If it is low, top it off. If it is dark, it can mean the fluid is wearing out and getting to the end of its life. You should also inspect the fluid for particles or debris, as these could mean you need to replace the fluid. Also, if the fluid has a burning smell, you should replace it right away.\n\nConsult the\u00a0Owner\u2019s Manual\n\nFind our vehicle owner\u2019s manual (always the best source for vehicle info) and learn more about the power steering system of your model. All vehicles have different guidelines and recommendations of when to change the fluid and what type is right. The manual will indicate how frequently to do this. Never use a brand or formulation that the manual doesn\u2019t recommend. This could harm the\u00a0steering components\u00a0and the entire vehicle.\nIn general, it is good to remember to change the fluid at least every two years, if not more often. This equates to about every 50,000 miles. Again, take a look at the owner\u2019s manual, as some manufacturers may suggest doing this more or less frequently.\n\nSave Money in the\u00a0Long Run\n\nSome car owners may put off changing the power steering fluid because of the cost. However, paying for a power steering flush or adding new fluid will be much less of a hit to your pocketbook than having to replace the pump, O-rings, or any other parts. You\u2019ll pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 for a flush or just a couple of bucks for a quart of fluid. If it is time to replace the power steering fluid in your vehicle, don\u2019t want any longer to take care of it.",

        "title": "Common Power Steering Problems",
        "content": "Causes for power steering problems\n\n1. Fluid Leak\n\nLow fluid levels due to a leak cause most power steering problems. A leak can allow air to enter the system and put stress on the power steering pump and other moving parts. If you experience tight steering, difficult turns, or a growling/whining sound when you turn the wheel while moving or stationary, low\u202fpower steering fluid may be to blame.\nThere are a few places you can check first to locate a leak. Fluid can leak out of the steering\u202fpump or reservoir, as well as the hoses or input\u202fshaft\u202fof the steering rack. Finding a leak in the boot bellows of the steering rack takes a little more effort. Check for these internal leaks by sliding the rubber boot bellow back off of the housing (about two inches) and looking inside for power steering fluid. If fluid has accumulated inside the bellow, the rack seals are leaking. Be sure the wetness is power steering fluid and not assembly grease that has liquefied from heat over time.\n\n2. Other Causes of Tight Steering\n\nOutside of a fluid leak, tight steering may occur due to a worn or slipping\u202fbelt, which is usually very evident when you are turning as the belt will squeal. A failing Power Steering Pump will often make a similar sound to low power steering fluid, or sometimes, will lose its ability to hydraulically move the power steering fluid properly and become stiff and tight, especially at lower RPM. This can be very noticeable if turning into a parking spot or parallel parking becomes difficult to turn the wheel, but at regular speeds (and engine speed) turning works just fine. Also, general wear and tear of the moving parts in the rack and pinion, or steering components on a conventional system can cause issues, like the steering gearbox.\n\n3. Causes of steering wander\n\nLooseness or unpredictability in the wheel \u2013 known as steering wander \u2013 is a less obvious power steering problem that can be caused by a number of things.\nThe first and easiest issue to tackle it to make sure the vehicle is properly aligned. Over time, as steering components wear and lose their tolerance, your alignment will fall out of spec. Getting a proper alignment can and will alleviate many steering wander issues, and at the same time, an installer can align the vehicle and check over components for any failure-points.\nMany trucks and SUV\u2019s use a steering damper that can also fail, and is used to take up something known as \u201cbump-steer\u201d where bumps in the road can cause the steering to suddenly jolt slightly to the side.\nOther components that can cause issues are rack and pinion mounting bushings, inner or outer tie rod ends, or on a conventional system, idler or pitman arms, or drag links. Many of these issues present a tell-tale sign on your tires of premature, and uneven wear as well.\nIn most cases even an avid DIY\u2019er will benefit from taking the car in for an alignment (or doing an alignment) to evaluate how the components are doing, and if everything is OK, get the vehicle into proper alignment. You can search and select an installer in your area and also see who does alignments as well.\n\nSee our video library for more information on power steering",

This 650-mile stretch of highway covers almost the entirety of the California coastline and takes you by the scenic cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Los Angeles.\n\nTips and Tricks:\nEven though you\u2019re traveling by the beach, you\u2019ll want to be sure to bring at least a light jacket in addition to your normal beach gear due to the colder winds brought in by the Pacific Ocean. Once you\u2019ve packed all the typical road trip must haves, I\u2019d recommend an oil change with Mobil 1 motor oil to be certain that your car has what it takes to make this journey. You can use this handy oil finder tool to figure out which formula is best for your specific make and model.\n\n#2 Route 66\n\nIt\u2019d be impossible to write this list without mentioning Route 66. The world-famous route stretches all the way from Los Angles to Chicago and takes about two weeks to complete. Along the way, you can take in all our country has to offer with beautiful mountains, quaint small towns, vast deserts, and all the iconic tourist destinations that line this historic path.\nTips and Tricks:\nMany of the small businesses and gas stations you\u2019ll encounter don\u2019t accept credit or debit cards, so it\u2019s important to bring a small reserve of spending cash to be sure you\u2019re always prepared on this 2,000-mile journey. To make sure your car is ready for a trip this long, I\u2019d recommend upgrading to a motor oil with a longer oil drain interval such as Mobil 1 Extended Performance.\n\n#3 Moab, Utah\n\nIf you\u2019re a bit more of a thrill-seeker, then this is the place for you. Moab is a well-known location in the off-roading community because of its intense trails and picturesque scenery. These rugged roads are the perfect playground for those who like to take their adventure to the extreme.\n\nTips and Tricks:\nBefore you go, make sure to do your research. Due to its popularity, many trails are partially or even fully closed to off-road vehicles. Every location has different rules that you should check before you go. Luckily, many of the sites have road trip checklists that can help you know what all is required for your trip. These trails can be extremely demanding on any vehicle, so make sure to fill your truck with Mobil 1 Truck & SUV to be sure it\u2019s up to the task.\u00a0\n\n#4 Blue Ridge Parkway\n\nAlmost heaven\u00a0\u2014 this gorgeous parkway goes through scenic areas of Western Virginia that inspired the song Take Me Home, Country Roads. The best road trips have something for everyone, and Blue Ridge Parkway is no exception. These rolling hills are home to many wonderful places to camp, fish, hike, and explore with the entire family.\n\nTips and Tricks:\nThis is your escape to the outdoors\u2026 so pack accordingly. Tents, bug spray, hiking boots, and anything else you need to thrive outside are a must. As John Denver said, life is old here, so I\u2019d recommend using Mobil 1 High Mileage if your car is as well-traveled as the scenic route you\u2019ll be driving on.\n\n#5 Dog Mountain (Saint Johnsbury, Vermont)\n\nGoing on a road trip with your dog is a great way save money on pet sitting as well as bond with your furry friend, so what better place to go than Dog Mountain? Located in Saint Johnsbury, Vermont, Dog Mountain is a 150-acre leash-free space filled with trails, meadows, ponds, and even a dedicated Dog Chapel. With plenty of events happening all summer long, this is a must-see location for all dog-lovers.\n\nTips and Tricks:\nStart your road trip with dog food. To prevent motion sickness, feed your furry friend a few hours before you go. Once you hit the road, you\u2019ll want to take a 15-to-30-minute break for every 4 hours of travel. Try to plan these stops with your dog in mind, because they\u2019ll be better behaved in the car if you let them out somewhere more fulfilling like a dog park instead of a gas station. To accommodate these extra breaks, I\u2019d recommend using Mobil 1\u2122 Advance Fuel Economy formula to decrease how frequently you need to stop for gas \u2014 freeing you up to make stops your dog will enjoy more.",

The last spot to check out on the US-180 is Red Mountain, a volcanic cinder cone with a massive amphitheater-like opening at the center.\nAfter Red Mountain, the climate gets drier and starts looking more like the iconic Southwest desert as you near the hiking trails at Kaibab National Forest and Red Butte, a 956 foot tall butte that is sacred to the Havasupai people. The forest has trails for hikers with any level of experience, but the trail to the top of Red Butte is difficult. Your efforts on the Red Butte Look Out Trail will be rewarded with an incredible view of the San Francisco peaks and a sneak peek in the form of the top of the Grand Canyon\u2019s north rim.\nYou can stop at Tusayan Ranger District to learn about nearby hikes and wildlife before getting to the Canyon from Kaibab and Red Butte. Just a few miles later you\u2019ll find yourself at the Grand Canyon\u2019s south rim.\nMather Point is a great spot to get a good view. The multicolored cliffs and the mix of buttes and valleys make it clear why this is one of the world\u2019s Seven Natural Wonders, and the beauty only increases as you get closer to the Colorado River and the depths of the Canyon.\nIf you\u2019re looking for restaurants, lodging, or places to shop, it\u2019s time to stop by the Grand Canyon Village. It is a great place to find information on anything you want to know about the Canyon.\nThe Village is also the place to start many of the most memorable hikes in the area. Bright Angel Trail is a popular overnight hike to the river. The trail is about 9 miles long and you will not make it from the rim to the river in one day, so make sure to bring camping gear if you choose to go this route. You will also need a permit to camp. If the full trail seems a little too long, there are many stops along the way that justify hiking a few miles even if you don\u2019t go the full distance.\nThe Village is also near Yavapai Point, a place with incredible views and the Yavapai Geology Museum where you can learn about the 2 billion year process that created the Grand Canyon. If you still want to drive around the Canyon a bit before leaving the village, check out West Rim Drive, which has many stopping points where you can admire the scenery.\nOnce you leave Grand Canyon Village go east on AZ-64. The road will lead you to Grandview Point and Moran Point, two of the most famous places to look at the Canyon. You can also go on a hike at the Tusayan Museum, a self-guided trail through a restored Tusayan Pueblo, where the Hopi Tribe\u2019s ancestors once lived.\nYou\u2019ll take AZ-64 till you can turn south on US-89 to reach Loop Road. Loop Road will take you past the Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki National Monuments. Both of these National Monuments are around 1,000 years old. Sunset Crater Volcano is crater that is over 1,000 feet tall with a Lava Flow Trail for hiking and cinder cones for climbing. Wupatki is an enormous Pueblo ruin with over 100 rooms and a tower.\nLoop Road continues through Painted Desert Vista, a popular picnic spot located in the most recently active part of the San Francisco volcano field. You can continue following Loop Road as it eventually rejoins US-89, which you can take south the whole way back to Flagstaff.\n\n2. Route 66: Santa Fe to Santa Monica\n\nThere really is no road as iconic as Route 66. There are enough songs about Route 66 to make a road trip playlist. The Mother Road was built to connect Chicago and Los Angeles. The signing of the Interstate Highway Act led to this road being decommissioned with I-55, I-44, and I-40 replacing most stretches of the road. Many have held on to this beloved road, with many Southwestern states maintaining iconic stretches of Route 66.\nYou\u2019ll be taking I-40 for most of this road trip. There\u2019s not much of The Mother Road left in New Mexico, but it runs through Santa Fe and many stretches of I-40 run parallel to maintained stretches of Route 66. New Mexico\u2019s capital is famous for its Pueblo architecture and creative art scene.\nStick around a bit before you hit the road and see the Georgia O\u2019Keeffe Museum or any of the state\u2019s other museums and galleries. The Railyard Arts District is home to iconic galleries and a film festival every September. There\u2019s good eating too with plenty of restaurants serving green chile and other Southwest favorites.\nGo south on I-25 and switch to the I-40 in Albuquerque. An hour on the I-40 will get you to El Malpais, the Rivers of Ancient Fires, a national monument that features hiking trails near lava flows and cinder cones from the Zuni-Bandera volcanic field. You can even get a free caving permit from the National Park Service (NPS) and explore lava tubes, the surreally smooth-walled caves left from volcanic eruptions thousands of years ago.\nGrant is a city very near to the park with a lot of Route 66 memorabilia that exists on one of the maintained sections of the road. You can take an exit from I-40 to stop at Grant or just to cruise Route 66.\nRoute 66 merges with I-40 a while before you cross into Arizona. Once your there, it won\u2019t be long before you reach the Petrified Forest, a national park with trails through fields of trees that have turned to stone through the process of permineralization, which you can learn more about at the NPS-run museum. You can hike to the ruins of Puerto Pueblo, a pueblo built by the Anasazi people that is known for its hundreds of pictographs. To the North is the Painted Desert Inn, a Route 66 staple featuring murals by Hopi painter Fred Kabotie and a breathtaking view of the Painted Desert.\nTo the west there\u2019s Holbrook, a city with giant statues of dinosaurs lining the street, the Wigwam hotel that inspired the teepee-themed garages in Cars, and Meteor Crater, the aptly named location of the world\u2019s best preserved meteor impact site. It is enormous, beautiful, and well worth visiting.\nOn the other side of Flagstaff is Bill Williams Mountain, where you can drive a highway around the 9,259 foot mountain or, if you have a off-road capable 4X4, up the mountain on the gravel road. It might be best to skip this drive if you are not an experienced off-roader. The mountain is just outside of Kingman, a city right on Route 66 with a museum with a collection of off-kilter classic cars.\nAt the border of Arizona and California you can stop by Havasu National Wildlife Refuge and Lake Havasu City, where you will find the lake of its namesake, countless hiking trails, and\u2026 oddly enough, London Bridge, which was purchased and imported by Robert P. McCulloch, one of the city\u2019s co-founders.\nYou can actually drive on Route 66 through most of California on your through Barstow and San Bernardino to Los Angeles and Santa Monica, where Route 66 ends. You can make detours to Palm Springs or Joshua Tree. The First Original McDonalds Museum is in San Bernardino. When you get to Los Angeles you can take Route 66 through Hollywood to Santa Monica and head to the beach. If you really can\u2019t get enough of California, go ahead and drive on SR-1, a highway that runs right along the ocean.\n\n3. Take your time going from Denver to Moab\n\nDenver and Moab are less than 6 hours apart if you drive straight there. You should not drive straight from Denver to Moab, because there are so many sights to see between. Many of the places on this trip are best visited in an off-road capable 4X4.\nLeave Denver on I-70 and pass through the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests. There are plenty of camping sites, and you can also hike or climb at Grays Peak, the highest point on the continental divide, a 14,278 foot mountain with a trail that\u2019s relatively easy for a mountain of this size, but still best for experienced hikers. Even to get to the trailhead you will need a 4X4.\nContinuing west on the interstate you will get to Colorado National Monument an area high on the Colorado Plateau with a natural history museum and scenic roads like Rim Rock Drive. This 23 mile road is worth the detour as it runs along the upper rim of a series of canyons. Grand Mesa, the largest flat-topped mountain, is nearby.\nMoab is the destination, but it\u2019s also the first step to many destinations. It has become a hit tourist destination because of how close it is to many national parks and trails. If you\u2019re a hard core off-road driver, you will probably make the most of the off-road trails that have names like Steel Bender and Hell\u2019s Revenge.\nThere are many local motels in the town and even more camping sites nearby. You can get a hearty meal at great local restaurants after a hard day of hiking. Moab makes a great center for your excursions into other parks in the area like Arches National Park where enormous, other-worldly rock formations jut out of the earth or form arches.\nCanyonlands is the place to go for a scenic drive. The easiest way to see Canyonlands is from a paved scenic drive called the Island in the Sky. This road is 20 miles long atop a 1,500 foot mesa, giving road trippers a view of the canyons for over 100 miles in any direction. There are also pullouts near scenic overviews and off-road and hiking trails.\nOn the way to or from Moab, be sure to take Highway 128, a detour between Moab and I-70. This highway winds along the Colorado River where there are miles of swimming, camping, and kayaking spots.",

        "title": "Snow Tires Vs Chains: Which is Better?",
        "content": "What are Snow Tires?\u00a0\n\nSnow tires are specifically engineered for winter weather. Winter tires typically have flexible tread rubber, which keeps them from stiffening in the cold. They have deeper tread patterns that protect against snow buildup so the tire can maintain traction with the ground so you don\u2019t get stuck in the snow. Winter tires also contain biting edges, allowing drivers to drive over ice without sliding. The best snow tires make it easier to maintain control of your car.\u00a0\n\nWhat are Tire Chains?\u00a0\n\nTire chains are especially helpful for vehicles traveling through heavy snow and mountainous areas. Tire chains typically come in various sizes, and drivers must select the right size, as the wrong one can damage tires.\u00a0\u00a0\nLike snow tires, they allow drivers to maintain traction in the snow, prevent slipping, and stop wheel spin. It\u2019s important to drive at a slow pace when using tire chains and only use them on snow.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTire Chain\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Snow Tires and Tire Chains?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSnow tires are actual tires, while show chains for cars are an accessory \u2014 metal chains \u2014 that you wrap around your tires. They help to accomplish similar things for your car\u2019s safety. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to both types of protection for your tires.\u00a0\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Snow Tires\u00a0\n\nSnow tires are designed to offer you more traction as you drive in winter weather. This can improve your handling and braking as you navigate snowy and icy roads. Additionally, they have more flexible material, meaning they won\u2019t face the same damage as standard tires and can likely even last much longer.\u00a0\u00a0\nNevertheless, snow tires can come with some cons. The first is the type of snow tires you use may be restricted. For example, if you prefer studded snow tires, you need to look at the restrictions as some states do not allow the use of studded tires. Additionally, paying for another set of tires and changing them every winter can be a hassle. You must research and invest in the best winter tires for your car since they come in various sizes. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Pros and Cons of Snow Chains\u00a0\n\nSnow tire chains can be a great alternative if you don\u2019t regularly drive in ice and snow. Since installing them includes putting them over your regular tires, they are a possible temporary option. Additionally, if you have to traverse roadways with deep snow, tire chains allow for strong handling in deep snow. They are also ideal if you have to drive through mountainous areas or areas with bad weather. \u00a0\u00a0However, there are some disadvantages you should be aware of. Snow chains for cars may have some restrictions or use limitations, depending on the state. Also, they can be challenging to install if you aren\u2019t experienced with them and can even damage your car if not attached to your vehicle correctly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSnow Tires vs. Chains: Which is Better?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, snow tires vs. chains, which one is better? Determining the option that\u2019s better for your car will depend on these factors:\nHow often you drive in winter weather \u2013 If you know you don\u2019t regularly travel in winter weather, a temporary option like snow chains may make more sense. However, snow tires are more appropriate for those dealing with cold weather routinely.\u00a0\u00a0State restrictions \u2013 Some states have restrictions against studded tires, while others may have specific requirements for tire chain usage. You need to check your state\u2019s regulations to see what you\u2019re allowed to use and when.\u00a0\u00a0Pricing \u2013 Depending on the brand, tire chains are typically cheaper than snow tires. Additionally, you can likely install tire chains yourself, whereas you may want to get a professional to help you install all the snow tires on your car.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhether you purchase snow tires and snow tire chains will depend on your preferences. Both items can help you winterize your car. Tire chains may be the best option if you want to save money and don\u2019t often drive in winter weather. However, if driving in snow and ice will be a regular activity for you, and you don\u2019t mind switching tires throughout the year, then snow tires are a viable option. \u00a0\u00a0For a look at some of our highly-rated snow chains, check out the Quality Chain 26lb Truck and SUV Cable Tire Snow Chains and Quality Chain QV343 Passenger Car Volt Cable Tire Snow Chains.",

        "title": "How to Jack Up a Car",
        "content": "Choosing the Right Jack\n\nThere are several types of car jacks available, each with its own advantages and ideal use cases:\n\nHydraulic jacks. These are among the most common and versatile jacks. They use hydraulic fluid to lift your car smoothly and efficiently. By far, floor jacks are the most common type here, and they\u2019re extremely capable around the garage, but not very portable.\nScissor jacks. Scissor jacks are compact and often come with your vehicle for emergency tire changes. Using a tire iron or another part of your tire change kit, you crank the scissor jack under the lift point on your vehicle. They\u2019re lightweight and easy to use but require more time and effort to lift the car.\nBottle jacks. These jacks are sturdy and suitable for lifting heavier vehicles. They work well for trucks and SUVs, but they tend to be bulkier. They\u2019re actually a type of hydraulic jack as well, using fluid to extend the cylinder upward.\nHi-lift jacks. Mainly intended for SUVs and trucks, hi-lift jacks or farm jacks are a large beam with an apparatus that climbs up when a lever is operated. They have an amazing capacity but their application is limited since it doesn\u2019t fit under lifting points for smaller vehicles.\n\nThe type of jack you should use depends on your vehicle\u2019s weight and the task at hand. Consult your car\u2019s manual to determine the recommended jack and lifting points. Always choose a jack that can safely support your car\u2019s weight.\n\nPreparing Your Car\n\nBefore you start jacking up your car, follow these safety guidelines:\n\nPark on a flat, level surface to prevent the vehicle from rolling.\nEngage the parking brake to ensure the car stays in place.\nIf you have a manual transmission, leave it in gear, either first or reverse, to add an extra layer of security.\nFor extra safety, use wheel chocks on the wheels opposite the end you\u2019re lifting to prevent any unintended movement.\n\nLocating the proper jack points is crucial to prevent damage to your car\u2019s frame or body. You should always check your owner\u2019s manual for specific instructions on where to place the jack, as this can vary by make and model. Common jack points include:\n\nFrame rails. Many vehicles have designated points along the frame rails for lifting. When you look at the pinch welds on a unibody frame, you\u2019ll often see notches about four inches long that are lift points.\nSubframe. In some cars, you can use the subframe as a jack point. Find a place on the subframe where the jack\u2019s saddle won\u2019t slip as you lift.\nAxle. For some jobs such as changing a tire, you can jack up the car by positioning the jack under the axle.\nUnder the bumper. For trucks and SUVs with steel bumpers attached directly to the frame, a hi-lift jack can be positioned under the bumper.\n\nHow to Safely Jack Up Your Car\n\nFollow these steps to safely jack up your car:\n\nPosition the jack. Place the jack in the correct position, ensuring it contacts the jack point securely.\nPump or crank. If you\u2019re using a hydraulic jack or hi-lift jack, pump the handle to raise the vehicle. For a scissor or bottle jack, use a suitable tool like a wrench or tire iron to crank it.\nLift slowly. Raise the car slowly and steadily, keeping a close eye on its stability.\nDouble-check stability. Once the car is lifted, give it a gentle shake to ensure it\u2019s secure before taking a wheel off or getting underneath.\nUse jack stands. For any work that requires that you get under the vehicle \u2013 even for a moment \u2013 place jack stands under the frame or other intended support points. Lower the car onto the stands for added safety.\nComplete your task. Perform your maintenance or repair work while the car is securely supported by the jack and jack stands.\n\nTo ensure your safety and prevent damage to your car, avoid these common mistakes:\n\nNever place the jack on an unstable or uneven surface.\nDon\u2019t use makeshift objects as jack points; always use the recommended locations.\nAvoid overextending the jack, which can lead to instability.\nNever crawl or place any part of your body under the car without proper support from jack stands.\nAvoid adding blocks between the jack and the vehicle\u2019s lift points.\n\nKnowing how to jack up a car safely is a valuable skill for any car owner. By choosing the right jack, preparing your car correctly, and following the steps carefully, you can perform your vehicle repairs and maintenance safely and efficiently. Remember to consult your car\u2019s manual for specific instructions, and always err on the side of caution when working on or underneath a lifted vehicle.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Winterize Your Car",
        "content": "8 Things to Check and Change to Make Your Car Winter-Ready\n\n1. Keep a Clear View with New Windshield Wipers and Wiper Fluid\n\nSnow and ice make it harder for your wipers to work properly. That\u2019s why it is important to inspect your wipers before cold weather comes.\nIf they are worn then it is time to replace, and it may be worth switching to winter blades depending on where you live. Winter blades are specifically designed for snow and ice with a rubber-shrouded frame that prevents ice build-up and maintains even pressure distribution.\nIf you live somewhere particularly cold, swap out your wiper fluid with one that is made to withstand extreme winter temperatures.\n\n2. Light Up the Road Ahead with Bright Headlights\n\nWinter means shorter days, meaning you will use your headlights more than at any other time of the year. Check yours and replace dimming headlights before they burn out.\nIf one headlight is burned out, the other one may burn out soon. That\u2019s why we recommend replacing headlights in pairs.\n\n3. Ensure Tire Grip with Tread Depth and Pressure Gauges\n\nInspect your tires for adequate tread depth. Proper tread depth will offer more bite on the road. In some places, it might be a good idea to switch to winter tires.\nUse a pressure gauge to check the tires for proper inflation. Having the right air pressure helps your car keep traction when accelerating and braking. The recommended pressure can be found in your owner\u2019s manual.\n\n4. Protect Your Finish with Paint and Glass Care\n\nWash and wax your vehicle to protect your paint from the corrosive effects of road salt. Maintain optimal visibility by thoroughly cleaning your windows inside and out.\nYou can prevent them from fogging up with anti-fog window treatment too. Using a water repellent on your windshield can help prevent water from sticking, freezing, and blocking your view.\n\n5. Pop the Hood and Check Your Motor Oil\n\nCheck your dipstick to make sure your engine contains the required amount of oil. If it is low, make sure to fill it up. Look at how clean the oil is and think about when the last time that you changed the oil was while you\u2019re checking the level. If it\u2019s dirty or hasn\u2019t been changed as soon as the owner\u2019s manual recommends, it\u2019s time for an oil change.\n\n6. Keep Your Car Powered-Up and Inspect Your Vehicle\u2019s Battery\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s battery works harder in colder weather. That\u2019s why you should visually inspect the battery for swelling, leaking, or cracks, and check for corrosion (white/green powdery substance) around the terminals.\nIf you need a second opinion, or your battery is more than four years old, take your it to AutoZone for a free battery test and/or charge.\n\nIn case of starting trouble, it\u2019s wise to keep some jumper cables or a jump starter pack in your trunk to avoid getting stranded in the snow.\n\n7. Protect Your Engine with Antifreeze and Coolant\n\nEven when it\u2019s below freezing outside, your car gets hot under the hood while running. When not running, your vehicle\u2019s cooling system runs the risk of freezing.\nIf you don\u2019t have enough antifreeze in your coolant mix, the mix could freeze and even crack your engine. Too much antifreeze can hinder your car\u2019s ability to cool the engine when in use.\nUse an antifreeze tester to ensure that you have the correct antifreeze-to-water ratio to protect your cooling system from freezing when not in use.\n\nIf it\u2019s been more than 24,000 miles since your last flush and fill it is likely time for another. Your owner\u2019s manual will have the exact interval.\n\n8. Make Sure Your Car has Reliable Belts and Hoses\n\nCold weather can increase stress on belts and hoses. Inspect your hoses for visible leaks, abrasions, cracks, cuts, bulges, or broken clamps. Look for glazing, fraying, cracks, or missing ribs on belts.\n\nThose are the big things to winter-prep your ride, but there\u2019s always more you can do to get ready for the cold months. Be sure to keep winter emergency supplies on hand, stay informed about weather conditions, and inspect your brakes.",

        "content": "Understanding the Check Engine Light\n\nThe Check Engine Light, often abbreviated as CEL, is a critical part of your vehicle\u2019s onboard diagnostics system. It\u2019s essentially your car\u2019s way of communicating with you. When this light illuminates on your dashboard, it\u2019s indicating that the Engine Control Unit (ECU) has detected a problem or irregularity in one or more of the many systems it monitors.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that the Check Engine Light doesn\u2019t pinpoint the exact issue. Instead, it serves as a general warning sign that something is amiss. To get to the root of the problem, you\u2019ll need to perform a diagnostic scan using a code reader to retrieve specific trouble codes.

Loose or Faulty Gas Cap\n\nYour\u00a0gas cap\u00a0is part of a sealed evaporative emissions system that recirculates gasoline vapors from your gas tank and keeps them from escaping into the air. Because of this, this system of lines and valves is closely monitored, and one of the key sealing pieces of this is the gas cap.\nIf you leave your gas cap off accidentally, it won\u2019t take long before the diagnostic system sets Check Engine Light codes. These leaks in the EVAP emission control system are often grouped as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d leaks. Its important to note that the problem is not always the gas cap, but could be one of the plastic recirculation lines, fittings, or connectors causing the leak, but more often than not, the gas cap is the culprit.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou can lose fuel through evaporation.\nYour recirculation system will not function properly.\nYou will have to stare at the CEL until it\u2019s fixed.\n\n2. Oxygen Sensor Issues\n\nYour\u00a0oxygen sensor\u00a0measures the amount of unburned oxygen in your vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. It indicates how thoroughly the air-fuel mixture burned during the combustion process.Oxygen sensors also live a hard life in +800-degree exhaust temps and are prone to fail over 80,000 miles or more. It\u2019s important to note here that there are a multitude of engine codes where the oxygen sensor indicates something is wrong, not necessarily that the oxygen sensor is bad. Be careful determining that a sensor is truly at fault, as opposed to determining something else is happening. This cannot be more apparent than in the ever-popular\u00a0PO420 / PO421 engine code, which is detailed HERE.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour engine will burn more fuel than needed.\nYou will lose fuel economy, and get fewer miles per gallon.\nFaulty sensor(s) can cause damage to your spark plugs and catalytic converter.\n\n3. Engine Misfires\n\nIf your car is misfiring, you probably aren\u2019t wondering to yourself \u201cWhy is my check engine light on?\u201d Your\u00a0spark plugs\u00a0ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of your vehicle, but if the timing of that spark, the mixture of the fuel and compression of the mixture isn\u2019t perfect, you will get a misfire. Multiple issues can cause a misfire, either on one cylinder or a multiple cylinder misfire.\n\nDefective ignition coil:(either DIS or coil-on-plug). A quick trick to determine if a coil is causing a misfire is to simply move the coil and swap with another on the engine. If you have a #2 misfire and move the #2 coil to cylinder #4, for example, then the misfire moves to #4, you know the coil is suspect.\nDefective fuel injector: If a fuel injector fails to deliver the proper amount of fuel to a cylinder, you will have a misfire. Unlike swapping the ignition coil with a neighboring coil, a fuel injector is more difficult to move.\nVacuum leak:\u00a0Vacuum leaks often cause multiple cylinder misfires, or lean running conditions. They also can be very difficult to diagnose.\nWorn spark plugs and/or wires: Sometimes, spark plugs can go far past their life cycle and fail, causing a misfire. On vehicles with\u00a0spark plug wires, a defective wire or wires can also cause this. For many drivers with older cars, it\u2019s a likely reason the Check Engine Light came on.\nBad compression:\u00a0A burnt or bent valve, worn piston rings, or valve timing that is off will cause a misfire as well. These issues are more serious and will all become apparent during an engine compression test.\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou will experience poor performance (reduced power, engine missing) and reduced fuel economy.\nThe misfire will only get worse, and will lead to mechanical failure in the engine.\n\n4. Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) Troubles\n\nYour\u00a0mass airflow sensor\u00a0(MAF) measures the amount of air entering the engine to determine how much fuel is needed to run your engine properly. If there are any leaks before or after the mass airflow sensor in the intake tract, a light can trigger. Mass airflow sensors are sensitive to oil, dirt, and water vapor, and any contamination on them can trigger a light. Sometimes, cleaning the sensor with intake or mass airflow sensor cleaner can fix the issue. Other times, the sensor needs to simply be replaced. Be sure to check the intake ducting carefully for leaks, rips, or damage.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nA faulty MAF sensor can cause rich or lean conditions, which can lead to further failures of other parts.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\n\n5. Catalytic Converter Issues\n\nYour\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0helps protect our environment by superheating hydrocarbons and other harmful tailpipe emissions into compounds like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Your downstream oxygen sensors carefully monitor the converter\u2019s performance, and if something goes awry, a number of trouble codes based on \u201cCatalyst efficiency\u201d will appear.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a catalytic converter will more than likely not fail on its own. Generally, something causes it to fail or not perform properly. Because of this, simply replacing the converter or the oxygen sensors around it will often not fix the problem, and often leads to yet another failed converter. Things as serious as a blown head gasket can force burned coolant vapor into the exhaust, triggering a catalyst engine code.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour vehicle will not pass an emissions test.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\nWhatever caused the converter to fail initially will continue to get worse, possibly causing engine failure.\n\nInterpreting Check Engine Light Codes\n\nWhen the Check Engine Light comes on, it\u2019s time to connect an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner to your vehicle. This scanner retrieves diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that provide clues about the issue. These codes consist of a letter followed by numbers, such as P0420. The letter indicates the affected system, while the numbers provide further details.\nUnderstanding these codes is crucial to pinpointing the problem accurately. You can consult your vehicle\u2019s service manual or use online resources to interpret the codes. While a specific code might suggest a particular issue, further diagnosis may be needed to confirm the exact problem.\n\nDiagnosing and Addressing Minor Issues\n\nFor minor issues like a loose gas cap or a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, you may be able to address them yourself. In the case of a loose gas cap, simply tightening it can make the light disappear after a few driving cycles.\nReplacing an oxygen sensor or spark plugs can be a DIY project for those with some mechanical know-how. Just be sure to use the right parts and tools and follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nSerious Problems and Check Engine Light\n\nIn some instances, the Check Engine Light can indicate more severe problems. Issues like a failing catalytic converter or a malfunctioning transmission can trigger the light, and diagnosing what\u2019s the root cause isn\u2019t always clear. Attempting to tackle these complex repairs without the necessary skills and equipment can lead to costly mistakes, so you might want to get a professional to weigh in on it.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring the Check Engine Light\n\nIgnoring the Check Engine Light is not a wise choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDecreased fuel efficiency. Many issues that trigger the Check Engine Light can reduce your vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency, costing you more at the pump.\nIncreased emissions. A poorly performing engine can produce higher emissions, contributing to environmental pollution.\nEscalation of problems. What might start as a minor issue can escalate into a major, more expensive problem if left unaddressed.\nSafety concerns. In some cases, the Check Engine Light can illuminate due to safety-related issues, such as a faulty airbag system or braking system. Ignoring these warnings can compromise your safety on the road.\n\nDIY Troubleshooting vs. Professional Assistance\n\nKnowing when to DIY and when to seek professional help is crucial. If you\u2019re comfortable with basic maintenance tasks and the issue seems minor (like a loose gas cap), DIY troubleshooting may be appropriate.\u00a0\nHowever, for more complex issues or if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to consult a qualified mechanic or technician who can accurately diagnose and repair the problem. If you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\n\nTips for Preventing Unnecessary Check Engine Light Activation\n\nWhile not all Check Engine Light activations can be prevented, you can take steps to reduce the likelihood:\n\nRegular maintenance. Follow your vehicle\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule, which includes oil changes, air filter replacements, and spark plug checks.\nTighten the gas cap. After refueling, make sure to tighten the gas cap securely to prevent evaporation of fuel vapors.\nDrive responsibly. Avoid aggressive driving, which can strain your engine and lead to premature wear and tear.\nUse quality fuel. Choose reputable gas stations and use quality fuel to maintain your engine\u2019s health.\n\nThe Check Engine Light is your car\u2019s way of alerting you to potential issues. Understanding its significance, interpreting the codes it generates, and taking appropriate action can save you time, money, and stress in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Is Traction Control?",
        "content": "What is\u00a0Traction Control?\n\nSo, what does traction control do? As its name suggests,\u00a0traction control\u00a0is a vehicle safety element that allows vehicles to take full advantage of road traction, especially when there is not much of it. That is, the system controls your vehicle\u2019s performance when driving conditions on the road result in low traction stemming from insufficient friction between your tires on the road. Low friction on the road may be due to snow, rain, ice, gravel or something else. When cornering, it can result from incomplete contact on the asphalt as your vehicle slightly leans in the turn.\nWhen you try to accelerate, your vehicle\u2019s tires must grip the road. If there is not much traction, your wheels may slip. That is, your tires may spin rapidly without moving your vehicle forward. When necessary, your car\u2019s traction control system engages. The system uses whatever traction is available to keep your car moving, most frequently it does this by slowing the wheel that is losing traction using the\u00a0ABS system\u00a0or an electronic throttle system.\nUnfortunately, if there is no available friction, the traction control system cannot create its own. Therefore, if you are driving on a nearly frictionless road, such as an ice-covered one, your vehicle may perform the same whether or not the traction control system engages. Still, because all roadways offer at least some friction, your vehicle\u2019s traction control system is likely to make a noticeable difference, and could even prevent an accident.\n\nA Brief\u00a0History of Traction Control Systems\n\nLuxury vehicle manufacturers, such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, and others including Toyota began installing traction control systems on some high-end sedans in 1987. Nonetheless, the technology first appeared in the early 1970s on a few powerful rear-wheel drive vehicles. Today, virtually all cars with anti-lock brakes feature some type of traction control.\n\nHow Does Traction Control\u00a0Work?\n\nTraction control can be incredibly useful when accelerating from a stop at a low-traction intersection. It can also assist you when climbing an icy hill.\nThe mechanics are reasonably simple. The system functions a lot like your vehicle\u2019s anti-lock braking system. In fact, on most modern vehicles, anti-lock brakes and traction control systems are integrated.\nTo understand traction control, you must understand the parts that make up the system. Typically, traction control uses the following three components:\n\nA hydraulic moderator\nWheel-speed sensors\nAn electronic control module\n\nWhen you are driving,\u00a0wheel-speed sensors\u00a0relay how quickly each wheel is moving. If one wheel starts to spin faster than the others, there is a good chance that wheel has lost traction or is skidding. The\u00a0electronic control module\u00a0uses an algorithm to determine when to engage the hydraulic moderator. This, in turn, activates the brakes in quick pumps to reduce wheel speed and improve traction.\nIn more advanced traction control systems, the vehicle\u2019s engine also comes into play. With these vehicles, if a wheel is losing traction, engine power to the wheel decreases. Whether you have a conventional traction control system or an engine-incorporated one, the result is the same: wheel speed drops to improve traction.\nTraction control systems engage automatically. As such, you may not realize there is a traction issue, until the light illuminates on your\u00a0instrument cluster. On the other hand, if your vehicle has a traction control system that involves decreasing engine power, you may feel a minor vibration when the system engages.\n\nWhat are the\u00a0Pros and Cons?\n\nClearly, traction control systems are beneficial in low-traction situations. After all, no driver wants to spin out of control when trying to move forward, or really ever. Still, traction systems can be problematic in some driving conditions. For example, if you are getting your vehicle unstuck from a very slippery or soft surface, all of your wheels may have difficulty gripping. If your vehicle\u2019s engine cuts the power to four wheels, you may not make enough power to get unstuck.\nTo combat this problem, many vehicles give the driver the option of turning off the traction control system. Typically, this involves depressing a button on the dash or interior console. If you do so, your wheels continue to receive full power. While they may spin, you may have sufficient forward motion to get unstuck. Once you\u2019re unstuck, it\u2019s generally wise to put the traction control back on again.\nYou should realize, though, that while many vehicles allow you to disable traction control, pushing the button may not completely override the system. Nonetheless, these vehicles often offer you the opportunity to select a low-traction setting. Once you pick the right option, your vehicle delivers reduced torque that both controls wheel spin and delivers forward motion.\nTraction control may also lure drivers into a false sense of security. The system is made to help you out if you skid, but it\u2019s not license to drive like mad. While the system is one of many safety features on your vehicle, you can diminish its effectiveness by driving improperly. For example, if you are speeding for conditions, your vehicle\u2019s traction control system may not do much good. Furthermore, if you follow too closely, you may slide into another vehicle or a stationary object before your vehicle\u2019s traction control system has an opportunity to stop the skid.\n\nCommon Problems\n\nAs with any complex system, your vehicle\u2019s traction control may wear out or break completely. Fortunately, if there is a problem, a warning light will illuminate on most vehicles. Here are some common problems with traction control systems:\n\nBad wheel speed sensors \nElectrical shorts \nConnector failure \n\nDiagnosing a problem with a traction control system can be challenging. Nonetheless, if you have an OBD-II diagnostic reader, an issue with the traction system may register a trouble code. You should realize, though, that a traction light may illuminate if your vehicle goes into limp-home mode. This may be due to a problem with the traction control system or another component on your vehicle.\nNow that you understand what is traction control, you can better plan for using your vehicle\u2019s enhanced safety features. You can also monitor your traction control system for signs of disrepair or damage. If you see any, find the high-quality replacement parts and tools you need for your project and order them today.",

        "title": "Why is My Brake Light On?",
        "content": "My Brake Light is on, What Do I Do?\n\n1. Start with the Parking Brake\n\nThis depends on when you notice the light. If you first notice the light when you turn on your car, you definitely don\u2019t want to drive it until you figure out what the problem is. The very first thing that you should check is to ensure that the parking brake is completely off. Depending on your car, the warning light for the brake system may be the same as the warning light for the parking brake. This means that if the parking brake is engaged when the car comes on, the brake light automatically comes on to notify the driver.\nThis warning exists because if you drive around with the parking brake engaged, it can cause wear and tear to your brakes\u2019 lining and this can cause them to wear out early.\nSo, the very first thing you should do is if the brake light is on when you turn on your car is to completely disengage the parking brake. If this does not fix the problem, then there is another problem with your braking system and you should not drive the car. (Also, in many newer cars the parking brake warning is distinct from the brake light.)\nIf the brake light came on while you were in the middle of driving, the first thing is not to panic.\nWhat you should do is drive the car to a safe area to park, and then slowly engage your brake to stop the vehicle. Once you have done this, call a tow truck to bring the car to a mechanic or your own garage if you\u2019re the type to work on your own car.\n\n2. Check Your Brake Fluid\n\nThe next thing you should check is what level of brake fluid in the braking system. Oftentimes, the brake light may go on if the fluid is low. If there is low braking fluid in your car\u2019s braking system, most likely there is a leak of some sort. This is a serious problem, because if there is no brake fluid in the hydraulic systems of your brakes, this means that the brakes won\u2019t function.\nA leak in your brakes hydraulic system should be taken very seriously. It is imperative to fix this or take your car to a knowledgeable mechanic quickly.\n\n3. It Might Be the ABS\n\nIf you have checked that the parking brake is entirely disengaged and there appears to be no leak in the brake fluid system, then it is possible that the problem is with your anti-lock braking system (ABS). Again, it depends on the model of your car, but in some cars the brake light comes on to signal an issue with the ABS system. In newer cars, however, it\u2019s likely that there is a dedicated ABS warning light.\n\nWhat Else\u00a0Might it Be?\n\nThe vast majority of the time, the brake light is on because of one of the above three issues. But, there is a less likely chance that the problem could be with a brake sensor. Another possible issue may be with the wiring in the car. That is, the brake light going off can be a symptom of an electrical issue.\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself where all of the warning lights are located on your vehicle. There is no standardization for this, but you can figure out where all the lights are located by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. After you turn on your car, for a split-second all of the warning lights should be illuminated. In that short time before they go off, you want to verify that all of the lights are indeed working. If you see that one of your warning lights is not going on during this check. you may want to get your car\u2019s electrical system checked out.\nWhile nobody likes to see any warning light go on, including the brake light, these lights are designed to prevent you from driving the car is something is wrong. Paying attention to the warning lights can save a life, even yours. These lights may be called \u201cidiot lights\u201d in jest, but they serve a vital purpose.\nMake sure that your braking system is up to date. One of the most important things you need to ensure that you replace regularly are your brake pads. Remember, the efficacy of your\u00a0braking system\u00a0depends on these pads, so make sure that yours aren\u2019t too run down. You can get the parts you need at your local AutoZone Store.

        "title": "What is an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)?",
        "content": "What are Anti-Lock Brakes?\n\nApplying a large amount of braking pressure can lead to a lock-up of the brakes, which locks the tires, making the car difficult to control. What\u2019s important to understand in the physics of driving is that a straight-line stop, even with tires in full lock-up is not where most of the dangers are presented. In fact, in most cases of a straight-line stop, a car will simply skid perfectly straight to a stop. When your brakes and tires are locked and not spinning, however, your car cannot steer, and herein lies the problem. In order for your car to properly steer and actually change directions, your tires need to be moving. Whether this is in perfect driving conditions, or wet, or snow \u2013 a panic stop is usually always coupled with another action \u2013 steering your vehicle to avoid what is in the road. When tires are in full lock, you cannot steer, your car simply plows forward.\nTo prevent this very issue, vehicles today are equipped with an ABS. Since the 1970s, with Ford and Chrysler leading the way, car manufacturers have begun including ABS on all their vehicles.\n\nWhat Do Anti-Lock Brakes Do?\n\nThis system uses a number of sensors to detect the motion of your wheels. When brake pressure is applied, sensors determine the exact moment that the wheel/tire is near lock-up. Before it locks up, the sensor transmits a signal to your ABS module, or controller, which then sends a signal to your ABS modulator, or individual ABS valves to systematically pump and regulate your brake pressure, meaning that no matter how hard you push, you cannot lock up the brakes. The timing of ABS brakes is carefully calculated to provide you with maximum stopping power while still preventing your tires from locking up completely. By doing this, you can apply maximum brake pressure and still steer at the same time.\nWhen ABS is activated, you\u2019ll feel a vibration as you step down on the brakes. Some vehicles have an ABS light that lights up when the system is activated. Even if you hold down on the brake pedal, you\u2019ll experience your brakes pulsing as your vehicle comes to a stop. Folks driving in winter conditions usually become far more acquainted to the ABS working, as during snow and ice it becomes very easy to trigger the ABS even with casual braking. Remember that while this may appear annoying, it is far, far better in a panic situation, because this still allows you to steer and avoid something in the road. You may not stop as quickly as if you\u2019d locked out your brakes, but you\u2019re also less likely to slide out of control. If your car lost traction, it could slide, and it probably wouldn\u2019t stop until it hit something.\n\nABS and Stability Control\n\nThe same sensors used to determine when to use your ABS are also used in many vehicles\u2019 stability and traction control systems. Since 2012, vehicles are required to come equipped with traction and stability control. These innovative features are designed to keep your wheels on the road and avoid tipping when navigating sharp curves and other dangerous features. They work by precisely applying brake pressure to certain corners of the car and can help counter a dangerous spin-out.\n\nWhat are the Benefits of ABS?\n\nAnti-lock braking offers you a number of advantages, although the system is far from perfect. When equipped in a vehicle, an ABS reduces the chances of the following situations:\n\nBeing involved in a fatal crash\nSliding off the road\nFrontal collision\n\nIn many of these instances, drivers attempted to lock out their brakes. Doing so would have caused their vehicle to slide out of control and potentially experience a life-threatening collision.\n\nPotential Disadvantages of ABS\n\nWhile ABS technology has come a long way since the early systems of the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, the system still has some disadvantages. For instance, ABS can in some cases increase the stopping distance of your vehicle. It decreases the risk of skidding, but it could cause a collision when you would otherwise have time to come to a complete stop.\nAn ABS system adds a myriad of parts that can also fail. These parts, especially the ABS modulator, can be costly to repair.\nAn ABS system can be rather annoying on gravel, icy or snowy roads as many times even light braking can trigger the ABS. While this can hinder stopping in a straight line, remember the physics discussed earlier of attempting to steer and brake at the same time \u2013 you cannot accomplish this well without ABS and therefore can be quite valuable in winter or icy driving.\n\nWhat Does the ABS Light Mean?\n\nMost vehicles are equipped with an ABS warning light on their gauge cluster. This light is linked to a series of sensors that monitors your system and warns you of any performance issues. This light may mean that your system isn\u2019t working properly. When you see this yellow, orange or yellow ABS warning light, something in the braking system is suspect. This system, as well as your stability control and traction control, aren\u2019t working properly anymore and in most cases, all of these systems will be disabled when the ABS light is on.\nIf you see a red brake light, however, do not confuse this with your ABS light. This could be something as simple as the emergency brake activated, low brake fluid, or a pad-wear sensor. Some vehicles do also have a red ABS light, or blinking light, so it\u2019s good to read your owners manual and get familiar with each light and exactly what it means.\n\nHow to Fix ABS Light Problems\n\nLuckily, there is one very simple common fix for an ABS light, and that is your brake lights themselves. Many vehicles are wired so that a brake light bulb, even the high-mount brake light bulbs, are wired to trigger the ABS light if one of them is out. This is the quickest option to check. \nIf all brake lights check out, the car will need to be further examined to determine the cause. Many code scanners have the ability to read ABS lights, which can be done at home to help pinpoint what\u2019s wrong. If you do not have a scanner capable of checking these codes, you can also check our local preferred shops in your area, who can help assist with diagnosing any brake issues. Remember, that operating your vehicle that\u2019s not working properly could put you at risk of losing control of your vehicle in a panic situation, so it\u2019s best to tend to the problem. Aside from the common brake light bulb, these main components of the system can also cause problems:\n\nABS modulating unit \u2013 (this unit is under the hood, where the brake lines feed into it. It controls the function of regulating the pressure to the brakes). Some vehicles are also equipped with ABS valves that do this same purpose, one for each wheel of the car, rather than an all-in-one unit.\nWheel-speed sensors \u2013 these sensors are a magnetic pickup that reacts to a cog wheel, either located on the brake rotor or axle/CV axle. While they can fail, they can also become clogged with brake dust, rotor dust, or road grime and sometimes need to be cleaned.\nABS control module \u2013 This unit is a micro-processor, similar to a vehicle\u2019s ECU that receives and directs the signals from the wheel speed sensors. Sometimes, this is located within the Body Control Module, the ECU itself, or is a separate unit.\nWiring between controller and sensors\nABS fuse\n\nThese components can be either damaged, clogged, or loose. As mentioned before, ABS sensors can easily be covered in dirt and other grime, which prevents them from working effectively. The normal jostling of your vehicle could loosen wiring connectors, causing them to unplug from the controller or sensors. These issues don\u2019t require any new parts purchases, but will need to be solved before the system is operational.\nWhether you\u2019re confident in your DIY electrical repair skills or would prefer to take it to a reliable mechanic, it\u2019s important to fix the issue. Some issues, like damaged wiring or brake pad and rotor replacement, are quick and inexpensive. Others, like a new ABS modulator, can be very expensive just for the part. Either way, prompt repair work can keep your vehicle safe from collision and skidding.\n\nKeep Your Vehicle Stopping Safely\n\nWhile you\u2019re checking out your anti-lock braking system, it\u2019s a good idea to inspect your brake system. Worn-out brake pads, sticking calipers, or low brake fluid could all prevent your vehicle from braking effectively when you need it most. Now that you know what does ABS mean in a car, it\u2019s time to solve your ABS warning light issue. \n\nShop Brakes and Traction Control",

        "content": "The Bare Necessities\n\nMaybe your car is jam packed with everything you want to put in your dorm or you could be confident in your car enough to only pack the bare necessities for an emergency car repair kit. Whatever the case, you should make sure that at the bare minimum, you have these helpful tools in your car should you find yourself on the side of the road headed back to school.\n\nJumper cables\n\nNot everyone can carry around a battery charger, but everyone should carry a set of jumper cables for emergencies. Easy to use, and great if you find yourself in a pinch, jumper cables will help charge your battery to get you back on the road. You will need someone to connect to their battery to use jumper cables.\n\nBasic tools\n\nBasic tools such as a screwdriver and a set of pliers wrenches could end up being a saving grace if you end up on the side of the road. Your emergency kit should include screwdrivers, pliers, vise grips, a tire pressure gauge, and a wrench.\n\nFlashlight\n\nEspecially in the darkest of times, you\u2019ll be glad you packed a flashlight in your car.\n\nGloves\n\nGloves will help you if you need to get under the hood. We recommend more heavy duty style gloves instead of disposable gloves.\n\nA Working Spare Tire / Jack System\n\nYour spare tire and factory jack are two of the most valuable pieces of equipment your car has, and it\u2019s often the most neglected. Be sure your spare tire is properly inflated, all pieces of the jack system are in-tact, and you know and understand how to use them. Read more about spare tire maintenance here.\n\nReflective Triangle\n\nIf you\u2019re pulled over to the side of the road, you should use a reflective triangle to mark the area of the road that you are on. This will alert other drivers where your vehicle is and could even flag down some extra help.\n\nBetter Safe Than Sorry\n\nYour car has shown some warning signs that it could use some love and DIY, but you\u2019re ready to get on the road and back to class. It\u2019s always great to have basic tools and something to charge a battery, so always make sure you have those in your vehicle. Here\u2019s what you can pack in your car just in case you have trouble on the road.\n\nBattery charging pack\n\nYou want to play it extra safe by carrying a battery charging pack in your car so in the event you do break down on your way back to school, you do not need to flag someone to help jump your car. New\u00a0Lithium-Ion\u00a0battery chargers are small, compact, and work excellent.\u00a0Learn more about\u00a0Lithium-Ion\u00a0chargers here.\n\nPortable tire inflator\n\nYou\u2019ve noticed your tire tread is low or you have a slow leak somewhere. A portable tire inflator will inflate your tire given it did not blow out or puncture. This is a quick fix and a great tool to have handy just in case your car is not able to make it to the next gas station.\n\nHead lamp\n\nYour car requires some under the hood work and both hands. A head lamp gives you the light needed and keeps your hands open.\n\nCoolant \n\nYou should always make sure your fluids are topped off before having a long road trip, but in the event your car overheats, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have some extra coolant in your car.\n\nReady for Anything\n\nThere is no such thing as unprepared if you pack with this emergency kit list. The vehicle is stocked with everything from the other two lists, but these items will make sure you have covered most scenarios of emergency. \n\nTow strap\n\nA tow strap will be the best tool in your kit to get your vehicle out of a rut. During mud and snow seasons, a tow strap can be a lifesaver, not to mention a lot cheaper than calling a tow truck.\n\nLight blanket\n\nKeep a light blanket that is easy to store with your kit should you find yourself without heat and waiting on help. It also makes for good use if you get too tired and need to pull over to rest. Always pull into a rest stop rather than stopping on the side of the road.\n\nBatteries, portable chargers\n\nFind out what kind of items in your kit use batteries or need a charge. Flashlights die and phones are prone to dying when you need them most. Having some spare AA batteries and a portable phone charger or car charger will go a long way when you need it to.\n\nFirst Aid kit\n\nRoad flare \n\nSometimes, a reflective triangle won\u2019t get the job done. Put a flare in your vehicle\u2019s emergency kit to flag down help. AutoZone sells a waterproof and floatable flare that uses 9 different signals to keep you safe on the side of the road.",

        "title": "Five Things to Check on Your Car Every Month",
        "content": "Maintain These Monthly\n\n1. Tire and Inflation Condition\n\nFlat tires can happen at any time and you will be glad you spotted low tread or pressure in your monthly maintenance. Check the pressure of all tires, including the spare, monthly. Check the tread for uneven or irregular wear and cuts or bruises along the sidewalls. Inflate tires and maintain at recommended pressure. Replace tires if worn or damaged. Maintaining your tire inflation and condition helps with traction on the road and even gas mileage.\n\n2. Engine Oil\n\nEven newer cars can still consume oil as a normal operating process. Some engines worse than others. Every month, check your oil to ensure you are full. If you notice your vehicle uses a bit of oil every month, this process will continue, so plan accordingly for it by having extra oil on-hand, so you\u2019re not scrambling for a 10.00 bottle of oil in a convenience store or gas station.\n\n3. Windshield Washer Fluid\n\nCheck fluid level monthly. Some vehicles have two reservoirs. Do not use water. Use washer fluid only. Top off this fluid monthly to help preserve your windshield wipers as you regularly clean your windshield. If you are heading into the cold, winter months in the northern half of the U.S, be sure you have winter washer fluid going in, and bug wash, or summer washer fluid coming out. These fluids, like Bug Wash, are not rated for severe temps below 10 degrees, and will freeze. This is usually right when you need it most!  \n\n4. Lighting\n\nLights are an important part of your vehicle and safety. Not only does your lighting help you see in dark or rainy situations, but it helps other drivers around be aware of your vehicle on the road. What\u2019s even more inconvenient is a burned out bulb, like a turn signal, brake light, or tail light leaves you suspect for a law enforcement pull-over. Even if a warning is issued instead of a citation, it costs you time. Replace bulb immediately if light is out. Check fuses first. Check out or guide if you need to adjust your headlights.\n\n5. Vehicle Washes\n\nThere is no doubt, folks who wash and clean their vehicle regularly, especially in the northern states that see snow and salt on the roads for half the year have vehicles who\u2019s appearance and finish lasts longer, which means a higher value when you go to sell your vehicle. Plus, it just looks better. Be sure to wash your vehicle at a minimum of once a month. In the northern states, it\u2019s recommended to wash and get the salt off of your vehicle as much as you possibly can. Choose a car wash that can perform an undercarriage wash as well.\n\nCar Care Council\u2019s Service Interval Schedule*\n\nAutoZone is pleased to offer the Car Care Council\u2019s Service Interval Schedule. \n\nRight to Repair Act\u00a0\n\n Make sure you have access to the most affordable and convenient vehicle repair tools and information. \nFor more information on the Right To Repair Act, visit Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association website.\n*The Car Care Council has developed a service interval schedule to provide general guidelines for the regular maintenance of passenger cars, mini vans, pickups and SUVs. Intervals are built around an oil change every 3,000 miles, an accepted recommendation for the majority of motorists who are severe service drivers. Always consult your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual for specific recommendations by the car maker.",

        "title": "Nine Month or  9,000 Mile Maintenance Checklist",
        "content": "Maintenance Every Nine Months or 9,000 Miles\n\n1. Automatic Transmission Fluid\n\nCheck fluid level with engine running and transmission in park. Automatic transmission fluid provides the hydraulic fluid used by automatic transmissions to function. By checking and maintaining this fluid, the transmission will stay lubricated and cool. If low, add the type of automatic transmission fluid specified in the owner\u2019s manual and/or on dipstick. For maximum performance, change every two years or 24,000 miles, or as directed in owner\u2019s manual.\n\n2. Exhaust\n\nInspect for leaks, damage and broken supports or hangers if there is an unusual noise. Exhaust leaks can be dangerous and must be corrected without delay. A normal exhaust can last anywhere between two to three years, but it is best to stay on top of regular checks to avoid expensive problems.\n\n3. Battery and Cables\n\nBattery should be securely mounted. Battery connection should be clean, tight and corrosion free. If you notice corrosion on your battery, consider brushing the corrosion off with a wire brush after the battery has been disconnected. Never operate on a battery while it is connected. If the battery is three years old or more, it should be tested and replaced if necessary. \n\n4. Engine Air Filter\n\nInspect filter at each oil change. Replace annually or when leaking, torn, water or oil soaked, dirty or showing other signs of wear. Other signs of wear include unusual engine sounds, service engine light, and reduced horsepower. To learn how to replace your air filter, check out this how to guide to get the job done right.\n\n5. Fuel Filter\n\nInspect filter at each oil change. Fuel filters help refine the oil in your vehicle, and help with the absorbents in fuel that can contaminate your engine. Replace if restricted or water contaminated or once a year on cars with carburetors. On cars with fuel injection, replace filter every two years or 24,000 miles.\n\n6. Power Steering Fluid\n\nPower steering fluid assists the driver when turning the wheel. It is pressurized hydraulic fluid that protects o-rings and seals. Check the fluid with the car warmed up. Add correct type of fluid if low. If frequent topping off is required, inspect for leaks and replace if contaminated.\n\n7. Belts\n\nCheck V-belts and serpentine belts for looseness and condition. Replace when cracked, frayed, glazed or showing signs of excessive wear. Replace timing belt per interval specified in owner\u2019s manual. Typically this is 60,000 to 90,000 miles. Not replacing the belt as required could cause a breakdown or serious engine damage.\n\n8. Engine Oil And Filter\n\nIf nothing else, this is the step you should always check and maintain for basic car care. Check level with engine off at every fill up. For maximum engine life, change oil and filter every three months or 3,000 miles or as directed in your owner\u2019s manual. Use specified oil grade and weight. If you are a driver that reaches 3,000 miles before three months, consider switching to a high mileage oil or read some of our trustworthy advice on the kind of oil you need.\nDo you need to change your oil? Read our easy steps to changing your oil guide so you can get back on the road.\n\n9. Hoses\n\nInspect hoses at each oil change and replace when leaking, brittle, cracked, rusted, swollen or restricted.\n\nCar Care Council\u2019s Service Interval Schedule*\n\nRight to Repair Act\u00a0\n\n Make sure you have access to the most affordable and convenient vehicle repair tools and information.\nFor more information on the Right To Repair Act, visit Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association website.\n*The Car Care Council\nhas developed a service interval schedule to provide general guidelines for the\nregular maintenance of passenger cars, mini vans, pickups and SUVs.

Replacement steering and suspension components may require periodic lubrication. Older vehicles have many chassis lube points. To DIY, you\u2019ll need a grease gun to accomplish this.  \n\n2. Power Steering Fluid\n\nPower steering fluid lives a pretty quiet life, that is, until your pump is dangerously low and lets you know about it every time you turn the wheel and hear noises, and difficulty turning. Check your power steering fluid once every 6 months to ensure you\u2019re topped off. This can also be accomplished every time you do an oil change. Make sure you check carefully on the correct power steering fluid for your vehicle.\n\n3. Wax and/or Polish\n\nWaxing and Polishing protects your vehicles finish and gives your car a glossy shine. It can help to eliminate surface scratches and swirls that occur from dirt and oxidation of your vehicles coating and also helps to provide UV protection in the sun. Wax or Polish at least twice a year to maintain and protect the finish.

Contact local recycling centers or service stations for more information on local disposal. Do NOT pour antifreeze down the drain. Do NOT pour antifreeze outside. The content of your antifreeze, whether it is new or used or mixed with another fluid, is important. Take note of the makeup of your antifreeze when inquiring about local disposal methods.\nHow Do I Clean Up Antifreeze?\nBe conscientious of spills in your garage or work area. Antifreeze should  be cleaned immediately if spilled. Carefully and safely absorb the material with kitty litter or sand, and cover with paper towels. Next, wipe up after letting it absorb or rest. Throw away the collected material and wash the area with soap and water before drying thoroughly.\nIs Antifreeze Dangerous for Pets?\nYes, very much so.

        "title": "What To Do With A Flooded Vehicle",
        "content": "Repairing a Flooded Car, Once Outside of Water\n\n1. Do Not Start the Car\n\nThis is key. High water that is up and over the engine compartment means that water has been introduced into the intake tract, and is likely inside any cylinder that had an open intake or exhaust valve. Attempting to start the vehicle at this point will result in hydro-lock, and a damaged engine which otherwise may be repairable.\n\n2. Disconnect the Battery\n\nDisconnect the battery as quickly as possible. In fact, disconnecting the battery BEFORE a flood in anticipation that flooding could happen (like a hurricane) is a good practice. Many electrical items in your vehicle have \u201cconstant power\u201d being run to them. Water mixed with electrical current will cause a failure in these components, where otherwise, simply cleaning and drying them can save them.\n\n3. Roll Down The Windows\n\nIf possible, roll the windows down. If the windows are electric, open the doors.\n\n4. Look For a High-Water Mark\n\nThis will give you an idea of the level of damage. It will usually be clear, especially on the interior. If the water mark is at a low level, below the dash, and water is just in the floor boards, this is the best-case scenario. If the water is up over the dash, then all the electrical components within the dash, and the engine itself have all been penetrated with water.\n\n5. Get Any Residual Water Out Of The Car\n\nIf the water level was low enough to not penetrate the dash area, then the car is probably not a total loss. Start by getting the residual water out of the floorboards with a submersible pump and/or shop vac. You can flush these areas with fresh water and vacuum out. Along the buttom of your doors, some vehicles have plastic plugs that can be removed, and several also have these in the floor boards. Remove these plugs to let water out. If the doors have these, remove the door panels and flush the bottom of the doors out with a hose. Once all the water has been removed, you will need to put fans on the vehicle to dry out the interior quickly, or mold will develop.\n\n6. Drain The Engine / Transmission Oil / Change\n\nRegardless if the water level was lower than the engine, it\u2019s best to completely drain and refill the engine oil, transmission oil, and differential fluid as all of these may have water in them.\n\n7. Remove Spark Plugs On High-Water Vehicle\n\nIf the vehicle has been in a high-water situation where it\u2019s suspect that the engine\u2019s intake tract was exposed to water, you\u2019re going to want to remove each spark plug.\nThe vehicle can then be either hand-spun, or cranked to check if any water is present coming out of the spark plug holes. If none is present, then water probably did not make it into the engine. Remove all the piping from the intake tract, and inspect for any mud or dirt indicating flood-water. Rinse the entire intake tract clean.\n\n8. Check fuel system\n\nSiphon out some gas and look for water. Water weighs more than gas, so make sure your siphon is at the bottom of the fuel tank. If you find water mixed with the gas, your tank will need to be dropped and cleaned.\n\n9. Check Other Fluids\n\nBrake, clutch, power steering, coolant reservoirs are sealed on most newer vehicles, but water can seep in.\n\n10. Check Electrical Systems\n\nIf key electrical systems are below the water line, they will likely need to be replaced, although some can be flushed, cleaned and left to dry. Checking and troubleshooting flooded electrical will often be the most labor-intensive of all the checks on the vehicle.\n\nFlooded Vehicle Repair Recommendations\n\nIf there is ANY possibility that there could be water in the engine oil or transmission fluid DO NOT ATTEMPT TO START YOUR ENGINE. Even cranking the engine will mix the water and oil/ transmission fluid creating and distributing sludge throughout the engine and transmission that will likely require full disassembly to clean out.\n\nOil Filter\nLikelihood to Repair: High\nChange the oil and carefully inspect the oil that comes out of the crankcase for water contamination. If any water is found remove the oil pan, oil pump and pickup to remove any contamination.\n\nTransmission Filter\nLikelihood to Repair: High\nIf your vehicle has been submerged for even a brief time it\u2019s likely that the transmission fluid is contaminated. A full (pan and torque converter) fluid and filter change is highly recommended.\n\nWheel Bearings\nLikelihood to Repair: High\nRemove spindle cap and check for any water. If any water is found, remove bearings to clean, inspect for damage (especially rust) and repack or replace.\n\nFuel Filter\nLikelihood to Repair: High\nEven if your fuel has not been contaminated it is likely you may get some contaminated fuel during the cleanup efforts. Replace your fuel filter so you have the most filtering capacity.\n\nSpark Plugs\nLikelihood to Repair: High\nIf the oil shows signs of water contamination, remove all of the spark plugs to inspect for water. Disable the ignition and fuel systems, then use the starter to spin the engine to expel any water in the cylinders. Replace the plugs or install new ones.\n\nBrake Master Cylinder\nLikelihood to Repair: Medium\nCheck the Master Cylinder reservoir for water. If any is found, use a suction bulb (turkey baster) to remove as much fluid as possible. Refill with new brake fluid and fully bleed the system from all four wheels to eliminate the water contamination. Run at least a full quart of new fluid through the system.\n\nClutch Master Cylinder\nLikelihood to Repair: Medium\nCheck the Clutch Master Cylinder reservoir for water. If any is found, use a suction bulb (turkey baster) to remove as much contaminated fluid as possible. Then refill reservoir with new fluid and bleed the system to eliminate the water contamination. Run at least a pint of new fluid through the system.\n\nPower Steering Pump\nLikelihood to Repair: Medium\nCheck the power steering pump reservoir for water. If any is present, remove as much as possible with suction bulb (turkey baster) and then flush the system with at least a quart of new fluid.\n\nFuel Tank\nLikelihood to Repair: Medium\nIf your fuel has become contaminated with water. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE ADDITIVES! Fuel additives are designed to address small amounts of water contamination. Remove all the contaminated fuel from your tank and flush the fuel lines from the engine compartment back to the tank.\n\nFuel Pump\nLikelihood to Repair: Medium\nIf you have an in tank electric fuel pump and your fuel has been contaminated, remove all contaminated fuel and inspect pump for damage.\n\nFuel Pump Strainer\nLikelihood to Repair: Medium\nIf you have an in tank electric fuel pump and your fuel was contaminated replace the fuel pump strainer to protect your electric fuel pump.\n\nBrake Pads\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nIf the vehicle has been submerged for a long time all friction materials may have been damaged. There is no method of determining if and how much they have been damaged. Respond immediately to any symptoms that arise.\n\nBrake Shoes\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nIf the vehicle has been submerged for a long time all friction materials may have been damaged. There is no method of determining if and how much they have been damaged. Respond immediately to any symptoms that arise.\n\nClutch Disc\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nIf the vehicle has been submerged for a long time all friction materials may have been damaged. There is no method of determining if and how much they have been damaged. Respond immediately to any symptoms that arise.\n\nCV Axle\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nRemove one retaining clamp for each joint and check for water. If any is found, remove the shaft from the vehicle to dry, clean, inspect for damage (especially rust) and repack with appropriate grease OR replace.\n\nParking Brake Cable\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nIf vehicle was flooded with salt (or brackish) water use penetrant lube with tube attachment to spray lubricant into the cable casing to push any remaining water out and reduce rust creation. Replacement of the cables is likely over the long term since it\u2019s impossible to remove all of the water.\n\nElectrical System Bulb Grease\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nAll electrical connectors and components submerged in water may exhibit corrosion related problems. Disconnect and dry out electrical connections and components and apply bulb grease to all connectors before reassembly.\n\nU-Joints\nLikelihood to Repair: Low\nIf U-Joints have grease zerksuse a grease gun to grease them, if any water comes out during this process remove the joints from the vehicle to inspect for damage (especially rust on needle bearings), remove water, repack with appropriate grease and reinstall OR install new joints. (For U-Joints without zerks remove from vehicle to inspect.)\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure where to turn with a flooded vehicle and aren\u2019t filing an insurance claim, seek out one of our preferred shops in your area to help you complete the inspection and work!",

        "content": "Slip control uses the traction control system to regain traction while driving on a slippery surface. Speed sensors tell the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) how fast each wheel is spinning. If the PCM detects a sudden jump in speed or that some wheels spinning faster than others, it reduces power to those wheels. This uses a combination of braking and throttle control. The slip indicator light will come on briefly when it\u2019s working. If there is a failure at any point in this system, the indicator light will stay on. Common problems include bad wheel sensors, bad wiring, or a failing ABS control unit.",

        "title": "Why Is My Check Engine Light On?",
        "content": "Understanding the Check Engine Light\n\nThe Check Engine Light, often abbreviated as CEL, is a critical part of your vehicle\u2019s onboard diagnostics system. It\u2019s essentially your car\u2019s way of communicating with you. When this light illuminates on your dashboard, it\u2019s indicating that the Engine Control Unit (ECU) has detected a problem or irregularity in one or more of the many systems it monitors.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand that the Check Engine Light doesn\u2019t pinpoint the exact issue. Instead, it serves as a general warning sign that something is amiss. To get to the root of the problem, you\u2019ll need to perform a diagnostic scan using a code reader to retrieve specific trouble codes. It generally indicates the direction you need to take to get to the bottom of your symptoms.\u00a0\n\nVisit Your Local AutoZone Store for Free Fix Finder Service\n\nVisit an AutoZone Near You!\n\nCommon Reasons for Check Engine Light Activation\n\nThe causes behind a Check Engine Light activation can vary widely, but some common culprits include:\n\n1. Loose or Faulty Gas Cap\n\nYour\u00a0gas cap\u00a0is part of a sealed evaporative emissions system that recirculates gasoline vapors from your gas tank and keeps them from escaping into the air. Because of this, this system of lines and valves is closely monitored, and one of the key sealing pieces of this is the gas cap.\nIf you leave your gas cap off accidentally, it won\u2019t take long before the diagnostic system sets Check Engine Light codes. These leaks in the EVAP emission control system are often grouped as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d leaks. Its important to note that the problem is not always the gas cap, but could be one of the plastic recirculation lines, fittings, or connectors causing the leak, but more often than not, the gas cap is the culprit.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou can lose fuel through evaporation.\nYour recirculation system will not function properly.\nYou will have to stare at the CEL until it\u2019s fixed.\n\n2. Oxygen Sensor Issues\n\nYour\u00a0oxygen sensor\u00a0measures the amount of unburned oxygen in your vehicle\u2019s exhaust system. It indicates how thoroughly the air-fuel mixture burned during the combustion process.Oxygen sensors also live a hard life in +800-degree exhaust temps and are prone to fail over 80,000 miles or more. It\u2019s important to note here that there are a multitude of engine codes where the oxygen sensor indicates something is wrong, not necessarily that the oxygen sensor is bad. Be careful determining that a sensor is truly at fault, as opposed to determining something else is happening. This cannot be more apparent than in the ever-popular\u00a0PO420 / PO421 engine code, which is detailed HERE.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour engine will burn more fuel than needed.\nYou will lose fuel economy, and get fewer miles per gallon.\nFaulty sensor(s) can cause damage to your spark plugs and catalytic converter.\n\n3. Engine Misfires\n\nIf your car is misfiring, you probably aren\u2019t wondering to yourself \u201cWhy is my check engine light on?\u201d Your\u00a0spark plugs\u00a0ignite the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of your vehicle, but if the timing of that spark, the mixture of the fuel and compression of the mixture isn\u2019t perfect, you will get a misfire. Multiple issues can cause a misfire, either on one cylinder or a multiple cylinder misfire.\n\nDefective ignition coil:(either DIS or coil-on-plug). A quick trick to determine if a coil is causing a misfire is to simply move the coil and swap with another on the engine. If you have a #2 misfire and move the #2 coil to cylinder #4, for example, then the misfire moves to #4, you know the coil is suspect.\nDefective fuel injector: If a fuel injector fails to deliver the proper amount of fuel to a cylinder, you will have a misfire. Unlike swapping the ignition coil with a neighboring coil, a fuel injector is more difficult to move.\nVacuum leak:\u00a0Vacuum leaks often cause multiple cylinder misfires, or lean running conditions. They also can be very difficult to diagnose.\nWorn spark plugs and/or wires: Sometimes, spark plugs can go far past their life cycle and fail, causing a misfire. On vehicles with\u00a0spark plug wires, a defective wire or wires can also cause this. For many drivers with older cars, it\u2019s a likely reason the Check Engine Light came on.\nBad compression:\u00a0A burnt or bent valve, worn piston rings, or valve timing that is off will cause a misfire as well. These issues are more serious and will all become apparent during an engine compression test.\n\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYou will experience poor performance (reduced power, engine missing) and reduced fuel economy.\nThe misfire will only get worse, and will lead to mechanical failure in the engine.\n\n4. Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) Troubles\n\nYour\u00a0mass airflow sensor\u00a0(MAF) measures the amount of air entering the engine to determine how much fuel is needed to run your engine properly. If there are any leaks before or after the mass airflow sensor in the intake tract, a light can trigger. Mass airflow sensors are sensitive to oil, dirt, and water vapor, and any contamination on them can trigger a light. Sometimes, cleaning the sensor with intake or mass airflow sensor cleaner can fix the issue. Other times, the sensor needs to simply be replaced. Be sure to check the intake ducting carefully for leaks, rips, or damage.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nA faulty MAF sensor can cause rich or lean conditions, which can lead to further failures of other parts.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\n\n5. Catalytic Converter Issues\n\nYour\u00a0catalytic converter\u00a0helps protect our environment by superheating hydrocarbons and other harmful tailpipe emissions into compounds like carbon dioxide and water vapor. Your downstream oxygen sensors carefully monitor the converter\u2019s performance, and if something goes awry, a number of trouble codes based on \u201cCatalyst efficiency\u201d will appear.\nIt\u2019s important to note that a catalytic converter will more than likely not fail on its own. Generally, something causes it to fail or not perform properly. Because of this, simply replacing the converter or the oxygen sensors around it will often not fix the problem, and often leads to yet another failed converter. Things as serious as a blown head gasket can force burned coolant vapor into the exhaust, triggering a catalyst engine code.\nWhat happens if I don\u2019t replace it?\n\nYour vehicle will not pass an emissions test.\nYou will experience reduced performance and fuel economy.\nWhatever caused the converter to fail initially will continue to get worse, possibly causing engine failure.\n\nInterpreting Check Engine Light Codes\n\nWhen the Check Engine Light comes on, it\u2019s time to connect an OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) scanner to your vehicle. This scanner retrieves diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) that provide clues about the issue. These codes consist of a letter followed by numbers, such as P0420. The letter indicates the affected system, while the numbers provide further details.\nUnderstanding these codes is crucial to pinpointing the problem accurately. You can consult your vehicle\u2019s service manual or use online resources to interpret the codes. While a specific code might suggest a particular issue, further diagnosis may be needed to confirm the exact problem.\n\nDiagnosing and Addressing Minor Issues\n\nFor minor issues like a loose gas cap or a malfunctioning oxygen sensor, you may be able to address them yourself. In the case of a loose gas cap, simply tightening it can make the light disappear after a few driving cycles.\nReplacing an oxygen sensor or spark plugs can be a DIY project for those with some mechanical know-how. Just be sure to use the right parts and tools and follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.\n\nSerious Problems and Check Engine Light\n\nIn some instances, the Check Engine Light can indicate more severe problems. Issues like a failing catalytic converter or a malfunctioning transmission can trigger the light, and diagnosing what\u2019s the root cause isn\u2019t always clear. Attempting to tackle these complex repairs without the necessary skills and equipment can lead to costly mistakes, so you might want to get a professional to weigh in on it.\n\nConsequences of Ignoring the Check Engine Light\n\nIgnoring the Check Engine Light is not a wise choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\nDecreased fuel efficiency. Many issues that trigger the Check Engine Light can reduce your vehicle\u2019s fuel efficiency, costing you more at the pump.\nIncreased emissions. A poorly performing engine can produce higher emissions, contributing to environmental pollution.\nEscalation of problems. What might start as a minor issue can escalate into a major, more expensive problem if left unaddressed.\nSafety concerns. In some cases, the Check Engine Light can illuminate due to safety-related issues, such as a faulty airbag system or braking system. Ignoring these warnings can compromise your safety on the road.\n\nDIY Troubleshooting vs. Professional Assistance\n\nKnowing when to DIY and when to seek professional help is crucial. If you\u2019re comfortable with basic maintenance tasks and the issue seems minor (like a loose gas cap), DIY troubleshooting may be appropriate.\u00a0\nHowever, for more complex issues or if you\u2019re unsure, it\u2019s best to consult a qualified mechanic or technician who can accurately diagnose and repair the problem. If you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.\n\nTips for Preventing Unnecessary Check Engine Light Activation\n\nWhile not all Check Engine Light activations can be prevented, you can take steps to reduce the likelihood:\n\nRegular maintenance. Follow your vehicle\u2019s recommended maintenance schedule, which includes oil changes, air filter replacements, and spark plug checks.\nTighten the gas cap. After refueling, make sure to tighten the gas cap securely to prevent evaporation of fuel vapors.\nDrive responsibly. Avoid aggressive driving, which can strain your engine and lead to premature wear and tear.\nUse quality fuel. Choose reputable gas stations and use quality fuel to maintain your engine\u2019s health.\n\nThe Check Engine Light is your car\u2019s way of alerting you to potential issues. Understanding its significance, interpreting the codes it generates, and taking appropriate action can save you time, money, and stress in the long run.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Bad Oxygen Sensor (O2) Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Purpose of Oxygen Sensors\n\nMost vehicles on the road today have internal combustion engines. To generate the power necessary to move the vehicle, the engine burns a precise mixture of fuel and air. This process, of course, creates certain emissions. Both to improve engine efficiency and minimize emissions, vehicles manufactured after 1980 have at least one O2 sensor.\nWith few exceptions, automotive internal-combustion engines require a oxygen-to-gasoline ratio of 14.7:1. If there is not enough oxygen in the mixture, excess fuel sticks around after combustion. Mechanics call this a rich mixture. If the reverse happens, the phenomenon is known as a lean mixture. Both can wreak havoc on your vehicle\u2019s performance and gas mileage. Even worse, the wrong fuel mixture can result in serious engine damage.\nCar manufacturers place oxygen sensors in specific areas to ensure the fuel mixture is neither rich nor lean. The number of sensors in a vehicle, though, differs. Those with V6 and V8 engines typically have three. A car with a four-cylinder engine, on the other hand, may more commonly only have two.\nOperationally, O2 sensors are basic. If the fuel-to-oxygen ratio is off-balance, a chemical reaction creates voltage. This voltage sends information to the vehicle\u2019s\u00a0electronic control module. Thus, if the sensor is not working properly, the computer must guess the amount of fuel that is necessary. If the guess is incorrect, pollution and poor performance may be the result.\n\nSigns of a Faulty or Failing Oxygen Sensor\n\nCommon Check Engine Light Causes: Oxygen Sensor\nAn oxygen sensor does not have to fail completely to give you problems. On the contrary, even a failing O2 sensor (sometimes called a \u201clazy\u201d O2 sensor) may cause your car to have a few issues. If you notice any of the following signs, you may have a bad O2 sensor or one that is about to go bad:\n\nAn illuminated check-engine light\nA rough engine idle\nA misfiring engine\nWorsening fuel economy\nFailed emissions inspection\n\nEven if your car\u2019s engine is not exhibiting any of the above oxygen sensor symptoms, it may still be time to replace your existing ones. In simple terms, O2 sensors are designed to wear out over time. As such, if your vehicle has driven 60,000 to 100,000 miles on with its existing sensors, depending on make and model, you may want to consider replacing its O2 sensors before they fail. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual may specify a service interval you better understand when to preventatively install new sensors.\nThe following parameters may be helpful guideline for when to replace your oxygen sensors:\n\nModel years from the mid-1990s to present day, replace O2 sensors every 100,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s with heated three- and four-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 60,000 to 70,000 miles\nModel years from the mid-1970s to early 1990s with unheated one- and two-wire sensors, replace O2 sensors every 40,000 to 50,000 miles\n\nDiagnostic Procedures\n\nIf you suspect your car has an old, damaged or ineffective oxygen sensor, you can likely either confirm or dispel your suspicions with an OBD-II scanner.\u00a0These scanners plug into your vehicle\u2019s computer and display diagnostic trouble codes. The exact error code for identifying a potentially faulty oxygen sensor, though, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Still, you should be able to glean enough information from the scanner\u2019s readout to determine if you have a sensor-related problem.\nNonetheless, you should realize that other problems may register the same diagnostic code as a faulty oxygen sensor. For example, you may have trouble with your vacuum system. As such, before replacing your O2 sensors, you likely want to inspect your vehicle\u2019s engine for other problems.\n\nReplacement Options\n\nIf you are unable to determine if you have a bad O2 sensor from your OBD-II scanner or a visual inspection, you likely want to take your vehicle to a reliable mechanic. You want to visit someone who has a diagnostic scan tool. This mechanic can tell you with virtual certainty whether you need to replace your O2 sensor. He or she also can likely pinpoint which oxygen sensor has failed.\nWhen it comes to replacing a faulty O2 sensor, you have a couple options. Because sensors are plug-and-play, you may be able to do the replacement yourself. That said, sensors are not always easy to access. Even worse, sometimes the old sensors can seize in place, making them very difficult to remove.\n\nTotal Cost\n\nThe total O2 sensor replacement cost depends on whether you do your job yourself. If you do, you only need to budget for the price replacement sensors, but you will need to clear the codes with an OBD tool (Rent through Loan-A-Tool\u00ae). This price, of course, varies from vehicle to vehicle. Many sensors, nonetheless, cost between $20 and $100. Your mechanic\u2019s labor costs also likely vary based on a few factors, including how difficult it is to access your sensors. Typically, labor costs for a sensor replacement are around $150.\n\nYour Next Step\n\nKeeping your vehicle\u2019s oxygen sensors in tip-top shape is critical. After all, if you have a bad or failing O2 sensor, you could get reduced gas mileage or even fail an emissions inspection.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Throttle Position Sensor",
        "content": "What Is a Throttle Position Sensor?\n\nThis vital sensor allows your engine to maintain a proper amount of air. This feature is dependent on the throttle valve. When you press down on the gas pedal, your throttle body unit\u2019s valve opens. This causes your throttle position sensor to adjust the engine intake manifold accordingly.\nThis little sensor is essential to a correct mixture of air and fuel. It\u2019s integrated with your engine control module and helps keep your idling and acceleration smooth. When this sensor is damaged or not working properly, it\u2019s important for you to replace it to restore your vehicle to its full performance and power.\n\nSymptoms of a Failed Sensor\n\nThere are many symptoms of a failed throttle position sensor. While some of these symptoms could also be signs of other engine issues, watch out for these symptoms of bad TPS, or throttle position sensor.\nThe most common symptom is your check engine light. This indicator is a vague symptom, as it could also point to a variety of issues, but you can expect to see it if there\u2019s any issue with your throttle position sensor.\nNext, any unusual changes in your acceleration could be linked to this sensor. During your normal driving, consider inspecting your sensor if you experience any of these throttle position sensor symptoms:\n\nHesitations during acceleration\nPoor power\nDifficulty and/or delay in gear shifting\nUnusual surges while accelerating\n\nEach of these could be signs that your throttle position sensor isn\u2019t working correctly. Too much airflow or too little could cause poor acceleration performance, but it could also be linked with other engine issues. If you notice your fuel economy has dropped dramatically, it could be a result of an improper fuel and air mixture.\nSimilarly, if your engine struggles to idle efficiently, it could also be a result of a damaged throttle position sensor. Stalling, surging, or hesitating while idling all can be caused by this unassuming sensor.\nThe best way to determine if these issues are caused by your throttle position sensor is to go to the source. By using a multimeter, you can determine if the sensor has an electrical connection issue. Check the engine control module for the trouble code that resulted in your illuminated check engine light to see if it is linked with your throttle position sensor. These two steps can also help you determine whether you need to repair, replace or reprogram your sensor.\n\nRepair, Reprogram, or Replace Your Sensor\n\nOnce you\u2019ve gone through the symptoms of a bad throttle position sensor, it\u2019s time to find a solution. Completely replacing your sensor may be the best way to avoid future issues, but some issues can be easily fixed by reprogramming or repairing your sensor.\nReprogramming or resetting your sensor can sometimes solve these issues. This step can also be necessary when you install a new sensor. The easiest way to reset your throttle position sensor is to unhook the negative cable from your battery for up to five minutes or to remove the fuse for your engine control module. Don\u2019t attempt this if you\u2019re uncomfortable working with electricity, as removing the wrong fuse or cable from your battery could be dangerous. Resetting is sometimes all that is required to restore your sensor. Code errors can cause your throttle position sensor to work erratically or incorrectly. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need professional software to reprogram your sensor. This job is best done by a professional mechanic.\nIf your sensor just needs repairs, it could be the result of faulty or loose wiring. Just like any other electrical wiring, your throttle position sensor is susceptible to corrosion and faulty connections. Once you\u2019ve established the issue is with your sensor and that it isn\u2019t a programming fault, check the wiring and connection points before purchasing a new one.\nFinally, sometimes your sensor is irreparably damaged. A broken sensor needs to be replaced in order to restore full functionality to your vehicle.\nIf your vehicle is having engine issues, it can be difficult to find the culprit. Many different components, including the throttle body system, work together to provide the engine with smooth acceleration. If you\u2019re concerned with the throttle body or are experiencing acceleration and idling issues, review these throttle body symptoms to determine whether your vehicle needs a new throttle position sensor and what you can do to repair, replace or reprogram your sensor.\n\nHowTO\u00a0Replace Your Throttle Position Sensor\n\n1. Removing Your Sensor\n\nFollow these steps to replacing your sensor. First, find the sensor. It should be mounted to your throttle body, which is on top of your engine.\nYou should disconnect your negative battery cable before removing the sensor. This helps you avoid the risk of electrical shock or causing an error code on your engine control module. Your throttle position sensor should be attached using electrical connectors. These connectors are easy to remove using the tab on the side.\nOnce the electrical connectors are removed, look for the mounting screws on your sensor. Carefully unscrew and remove your throttle position sensor. Be sure to read your owner\u2019s manual and compare it with your current sensor when shopping for a new one. Shop at your local auto parts store to find a quality brand or exact OEM match.\n\n2. Installing a New Throttle Position Sensor\n\nInstall your new sensor by working backward through the removal steps. Start by installing the sensor using the mounting screws. Next, connect your sensor to your vehicle\u2019selectrical system using a convenient electrical connector. You should be able to easily push it together and hear a distinct click. Check to ensure a firm connection.\nConnect your battery and prepare to double-check your work. Start your car and test the idle and acceleration. Depending on your vehicle and the sensor you\u2019ve installed, you may need to manually adjust the sensor. Other options automatically adjust to offer your car the optimal levels of air and fuel for a smooth idle and powerful acceleration.\n\nWhether you follow these installation steps or ask your local mechanic to replace your throttle position sensor, looking for these symptoms can vhelp you avoid costly engine repair, poor fuel economy or exponential damage to your vehicle. Inspect your throttle body when you see these symptoms and determine whether you need to reprogram, repair or replace your sensor.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Why is My Brake Light On?",
        "content": "My Brake Light is on, What Do I Do?\n\n1. Start with the Parking Brake\n\nThis depends on when you notice the light. If you first notice the light when you turn on your car, you definitely don\u2019t want to drive it until you figure out what the problem is. The very first thing that you should check is to ensure that the parking brake is completely off. Depending on your car, the warning light for the brake system may be the same as the warning light for the parking brake. This means that if the parking brake is engaged when the car comes on, the brake light automatically comes on to notify the driver.\nThis warning exists because if you drive around with the parking brake engaged, it can cause wear and tear to your brakes\u2019 lining and this can cause them to wear out early.\nSo, the very first thing you should do is if the brake light is on when you turn on your car is to completely disengage the parking brake. If this does not fix the problem, then there is another problem with your braking system and you should not drive the car. (Also, in many newer cars the parking brake warning is distinct from the brake light.)\nIf the brake light came on while you were in the middle of driving, the first thing is not to panic.\nWhat you should do is drive the car to a safe area to park, and then slowly engage your brake to stop the vehicle. Once you have done this, call a tow truck to bring the car to a mechanic or your own garage if you\u2019re the type to work on your own car.\n\n2. Check Your Brake Fluid\n\nThe next thing you should check is what level of brake fluid in the braking system. Oftentimes, the brake light may go on if the fluid is low. If there is low braking fluid in your car\u2019s braking system, most likely there is a leak of some sort. This is a serious problem, because if there is no brake fluid in the hydraulic systems of your brakes, this means that the brakes won\u2019t function.\nA leak in your brakes hydraulic system should be taken very seriously. It is imperative to fix this or take your car to a knowledgeable mechanic quickly.\n\n3. It Might Be the ABS\n\nIf you have checked that the parking brake is entirely disengaged and there appears to be no leak in the brake fluid system, then it is possible that the problem is with your anti-lock braking system (ABS). Again, it depends on the model of your car, but in some cars the brake light comes on to signal an issue with the ABS system. In newer cars, however, it\u2019s likely that there is a dedicated ABS warning light.\n\nWhat Else\u00a0Might it Be?\n\nThe vast majority of the time, the brake light is on because of one of the above three issues. But, there is a less likely chance that the problem could be with a brake sensor. Another possible issue may be with the wiring in the car. That is, the brake light going off can be a symptom of an electrical issue.\nIt is a good idea to familiarize yourself where all of the warning lights are located on your vehicle. There is no standardization for this, but you can figure out where all the lights are located by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. After you turn on your car, for a split-second all of the warning lights should be illuminated. In that short time before they go off, you want to verify that all of the lights are indeed working. If you see that one of your warning lights is not going on during this check. you may want to get your car\u2019s electrical system checked out.\nWhile nobody likes to see any warning light go on, including the brake light, these lights are designed to prevent you from driving the car is something is wrong. Paying attention to the warning lights can save a life, even yours. These lights may be called \u201cidiot lights\u201d in jest, but they serve a vital purpose.\nMake sure that your braking system is up to date. One of the most important things you need to ensure that you replace regularly are your brake pads. Remember, the efficacy of your\u00a0braking system\u00a0depends on these pads, so make sure that yours aren\u2019t too run down. You can get the parts you need at your local AutoZone Store.

        "title": "How To Tell If Your Mass Air Flow Sensor Is Bad",
        "content": "How the MAF sensor works\n\nMAF sensors are located between the air filter and the throttle body and are responsible for measuring the amount of air entering the engine.\nMost vehicles have a hot wire MAF sensor. It has one heated wire and one ambient temperature wire. The microprocessor inside the MAF sensor measures the air entering the engine by maintaining the temperature of the hot wire 200\u00b0F above the ambient incoming air. The energy required to maintain the sensor at the same temperature is calculated and sent to the powertrain control module (PCM). The PCM then controls the injectors to deliver the specific amount of fuel that\u2019s proportional to the airflow, creating an air fuel mixture that, ideally, is perfect for your engine.\n\n3 SYMPTOMS OF A BAD MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR\n\n1. YOUR CAR HESITATES OR SUDDENLY JERKS FORWARD WHILE ACCELERATING\n\nA bad MAF sensor can cause your vehicle to experience poor drivability issues such as engine stalling, jerking or hesitation during acceleration. This could happen while speeding up on the highway on-ramp or cruising down a city street. These issues can create dangerous situations causing accidents and injury. If you experience any of these symptoms you should examine your vehicle as soon as possible.\n\n2. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO RICH\n\nYour vehicle needs the proper ratio of fuel to air in each combustion cylinder. Running rich means there is too much fuel and not enough air. Signs that your vehicle is running rich include:\n\nBlack smoke exiting the tailpipe\nWorse fuel efficiency than usual\nRough idling\nCheck Engine Light\n\n3. YOUR AIR FUEL RATIO IS TOO LEAN\n\nRunning lean is the opposite of running rich. It means your vehicle has too little fuel and too much air. Similar to running rich, the MAF sensor is sending inaccurate information to the PCM. This time underestimating the amount of airflow instead of overestimating it.\nAlthough this will temporarily improve your fuel efficiency, running lean for too long can seriously damage your vehicle. You may experience:\n\nEngine hesitation and/or surging\nHard engine seizures\nHard starting\nCheck Engine Light\n\nAs with other MAF sensor problems, the solution may be as simple as cleaning the wires. However, it\u2019s also a good idea to have a mechanic check your vehicle for damage.\n\n4. YOUR OBD-II SCANNER GETS\u00a0CODE P0101\n\nIf your\u00a0Check Engine Light is on, use a code reader to see what diagnostic trouble codes the system puts your way. If you don\u2019t have a code reader, stop by AutoZone to use our free Fix Finder program.\nThis Code\u2019s full read out is: P0101 \u2013 Mass Air Flow Sensor Circuit Range/Performance.\nThe engine computer uses the MAF sensor signal to determine how much fuel needs to be injected to meet the proper air-fuel ratio. The MAF sensor signal is also used to calculate engine load, meaning it can cause trouble for the traction control system, or change the automatic shifting pattern in applicable vehicles. This code is most commonly caused by a dirty, obstructed, or faulty MAF sensor, but can also be caused by issues including:\n\nDamage to the intake boot\nVacuum leaks\nClogged or improperly installed engine air filter\nClogged-up cat converter or restricted exhaust\n\nBecause there are other potential causes besides the bad MAF sensor, it\u2019s worth looking into these other possibilities so you are positive this code is being caused by the sensor before you go about replacing it.\n\nA malfunctioning MAF sensor may cause your vehicle to jerk during acceleration, run too rich, or run too lean. Make sure to fix the problem right away so you can be safe, avoid costly repairs, save money at the pump, and avoid being stranded on the road. Be sure to take a look at the mass air flow sensor before replacing it, you may only need to clean your MAF. Stop by your local AutoZone for advice on symptoms of a bad MAF sensor.\n\nShop MAF Sensors",

These are found in some Toyota, Mitsubishi, and Lexus vehicles and can\u2019t be cleaned with MAF Sensor Cleaner.\n\nHow to Clean a Mass Air Flow Sensor\n\n1. Unplug the Sensor\n\nTurn the engine off, remove the keys from the ignition, and let the engine cool. Locate the mass air flow sensor by consulting your owner\u2019s manual. Unplug the part from the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.\n\n2. Remove the Sensor\n\nWith the sensor unplugged, loosen the clamps and any brackets holding it in place. Slide the sensor assembly away from the tubing and carefully remove from the air intake boot(s).\n\n3. Clean the Sensor\n\nPlace the sensor on a towel for cleaning. Apply the cleaner \u2014 10-15 blasts around the inside of the sensor will do. Also clean the sides of the part, its housing, its connectors, and its terminals. If you have a hot wire mass air flow sensor, make sure the cleaner doesn\u2019t get onto the hot wires or plate.\n\n4. Reattach the Sensor\n\nAllow the sensor to dry. This should only take a few seconds. Once the part is ready, you can re-install it back into place, reattach and tighten the clamps/brackets. Once you\u2019ve re-installed the sensor, wait a few minutes before starting the vehicle to ensure the cleaning chemicals have evaporated.\n\n5. How Often Should You Clean the Air Flow Sensor\n\nIt\u2019s safe to clean the sensor every time you change the air filter. The job is simple enough to be a part of your routine maintenance. If your check engine light comes on and there\u2019s a trouble-code related to the MAF, that would definitely be a good time to clean the sensor. This simple maintenance step can easily be performed in your garage whenever you have a few minutes to spare. In addition to fixing problems you\u2019ve had with your engine running or idling roughly, cleaning the mass air flow sensor can help improve your gas mileage and maintain drivability performance.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Why Oil Is on Your Spark Plugs",
        "content": "Causes of Oil on Spark Plugs\n\nOil doesn\u2019t burn nearly as well as gasoline or the oxygen in the air that\u2019s drawn into the engine. And when it gets on the spark plugs, it\u2019s a condition known as oil-fouled spark plugs, since they don\u2019t operate as well as they should. It can be caused by a handful of conditions such as:\n\nWorn valve guides or intake valve seals\nWorn-out or broken piston rings\nA blown head gasket\nClogged crankcase ventilation system\nLeaking valve cover gasket\nOverfilled engine oil\n\nEffects of Oil on Spark Plugs\n\nWhen you have oil on spark plugs, symptoms will be noticeable. When one of these issues is present, oil finds its way into the combustion chamber, often in tiny amounts at a time. But the unburned oil particles collect on the spark plug, interrupting the flow of electricity between the electrodes. The result is a misfire in that particular cylinder, which causes a loss of power rough idle, and decreased fuel efficiency.\nBut that\u2019s not the only effect. With fouled spark plugs, the engine could be more difficult to start, it can hesitate on acceleration, and potentially cause long-term damage to the engine.\nAlong with the effects on the vehicle, emissions are affected. Oil on spark plugs can produce increased chemical byproducts that can be harmful to the environment, as ell as clog or damage a catalytic converter.\n\nDiagnosis and Detection of Oil on Spark Plugs\n\nThe earlier oil-fouled spark plugs are detected, the better the odds of a repair before serious damage occurs. The most obvious step to diagnose oil on spark plugs is to remove each of them and check for the presence of wet oil or a black, tar-like buildup on the electrodes, insulator, and threads.\nHowever, some preliminary checks can also begin to point you in the right direction. Check the engine oil level to see if it\u2019s lower than it should be, particularly if you\u2019ve recently changed the oil. If so, it could indicate that there\u2019s an oil consumption issue. A Check Engine Light with DTCs related to a misfire \u2013 codes beginning with P030[X] \u2013 are quite common when there\u2019s one or more oil-fouled spark plugs.\nAlso, when the engine has cooled off, check the engine coolant for signs of engine oil. It can indicate that the head gasket is leaking, and oil could also be entering the combustion chamber.\n\nAddressing the Issue: Solutions and Preventive Measures\n\nSpark plugs can often be cleaned to remove oil and residue that contaminate them. However, replacing the spark plugs is a good idea if they\u2019re getting on in age and mileage already. But there\u2019s a reason that oil has fouled them, and that must be addressed.\n\nIdentify the root cause of the problem and fix it. A leak-down test can indicate if the valve seals, head gasket, or cylinder walls are to blame, and a compression test is helpful to determine if the piston rings are the root.\nChange the PCV valve. If the PCV valve is stuck, oil could be pushed into the combustion chamber through the intake. It\u2019s an easy repair.\nUse the correct oil grade. Especially on high-mileage engines, using the wrong grade of oil could allow some to bypass the piston rings.\n\nPrevention is a much more cost-effective method than a repair in this situation, and routine maintenance is the best way to keep oil-fouled plugs at bay. Regular oil changes keep your engine well lubricated, minimizing the potential for oil to push past piston rings. Avoid overfilling the engine oil to keep internal pressure from getting elevated.",

        "content": "Check your windshield wiper blades\u00a0\n\nCheck your windsheild wipers\nWiper blades can freeze to the windshield in a snowstorm, and ice and snow on the glass can act as an abrasive on the rubber edge. Check along the flexible rubber edge of each wiper blade for nicks and cuts. If you see damage, or if your wipers leave streaks behind after a pass, replace them both.\n\nInspect and top up the fluids\u00a0\n\nInspect and top fluids\nFluids can have moisture intrude or form from cycles between hot and cold temperatures. Contamination can occur, and oils can break down and lose viscosity. Check the color and level of each fluid including:\n\nEngine oil\nTransmission fluid\nEngine coolant\nBrake fluid\nPower steering fluid\nOn 4WD and AWD vehicles, differential and transfer case fluids\n\nIf they\u2019re in poor condition, flush and fill them with the appropriate fluids. Also, top up the windshield washer fluid.\n\nCheck the air filters\n\nCheck the air filters\nAlthough dust storms and bugs aren\u2019t the norm in the winter, the air still carries particles that will get caught in the air filters. Inspect the engine air filter as well as the cabin air filter to ensure they aren\u2019t coated in debris. Check that light passes through the pleats, indicating that air can still make its way through efficiently too. If the filters are dirty, smelly, or you can\u2019t see light through them, replace them. It\u2019s usually necessary every year as part of your vehicle maintenance schedule.\n\nTest the battery\n\nTest the Battery\n\nCheck the brakes\n\nCheck the brakes\nAs summer approaches, your brakes will need to be in good condition to bring your vehicle to a halt, and higher temperatures can cause brake pads and rotors to wear a little faster too. Make sure you\u2019re starting the season out right and that your brake pads have at least 3/16ths of an inch remaining at each wheel for both the inboard and outboard pad. Brake rotors shouldn\u2019t be gouged, and they shouldn\u2019t have ridges or pockmarks of rust on either side. If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process.

        "content": "Products You Need\n\nFor the DIYer, there are a handful of tools you\u2019ll need as well as your preferred method for cleaning the spark plug. They include:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA ratchet\u00a0\nSpark plug sockets\u00a0\nTorque wrench\u00a0\nPliers\u00a0\nCompressed air\u00a0\nIgnition cable boot pliers\u00a0\nSpark plug gap gauge\u00a0\nAnti-seize compound\u00a0\nSpark plug boot grease\u00a0\n\nOnce you\u2019ve collected your tools and products, it\u2019s time to get to work. Expect it to take between one and two hours to remove and clean each of your spark plugs.\u00a0\n\nHow to Remove Spark Plugs\n\nWhile it\u2019s technically possible to clean a spark plug with combustion chamber cleaner to a certain degree, removing and cleaning them individually is the best and most effective method. Each vehicle will have its own specific process to remove them, but generally, these are the steps to follow.\u00a0\n\n1. Locate the spark plugs on the engine. They are typically found on the top of the engine, near the center.\n\n2. Remove the ignition coil or ignition cable boot from the spark plug. Gently pull the boot free using boot pliers if necessary.\u00a0\n\n3. Use the spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs. The socket is designed to fit snugly around the spark plug and will protect the porcelain from cracking.\n\n4. Attach the ratchet or wrench to the socket and turn counter-clockwise to loosen and remove the spark plug.\n\n5. Repeat this process for each spark plug.\n\n6. Inspect the spark plugs for wear or damage and replace if necessary. If they are fouled but not badly worn, use your preferred method to clean them.\n\nWhen reinstalling spark plugs, be sure to torque them to the manufacturer\u2019s specified setting with a torque wrench, and apply a small amount of anti-seize compound to the threads.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSpark Plug Cleaning Methods\n\nAs long as the spark plug\u2019s center and side electrodes aren\u2019t worn and the porcelain insulator isn\u2019t cracked, then cleaning it is likely to be successful. Here are three ways you can clean spark plugs and get them firing properly again.\u00a0\n\nAbrasive Cleaning Method\n\nCarbon, oil residue, and even fuel can foul a spark plug, preventing the spark from connecting between the electrodes. An abrasive such as sandpaper, a brillo pad, or wire brush can help remove any buildup on the center and side electrodes.\u00a0\u00a0\nDry off the spark plugs and wipe any loose or sticky material off with a clean lint-free shop towel. Then, gently work your abrasive material of choice around the electrodes and wipe it clean frequently.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce you have a bare metal surface again, the cleaning is complete. From there, gap each spark plug to the manufacturer\u2019s requirements before installing them.\u00a0\n\nBlow Torch Method\n\nA popular method for cleaning fouled spark plugs, particularly gas or oil-fouled plugs, is with a lighter or torch. Because of the extreme heat that can be generated, it isn\u2019t always the wisest or most uniform method to clean a spark plug. However, it can and does still work in many cases.\u00a0\nFirst, wear appropriate gloves to prevent the possibility of burning yourself. Then, grip a spark plug in pliers or something similar to hold it and pass a torch\u2019s flame over the electrode. It\u2019s best to use the very tip of the flame to concentrate the heat best. Only keep the flame on the spark plug for a couple of seconds or you risk damaging it. Repeat it until the contaminant is dry and burnt away.\u00a0\nThen, let it cool and wipe the electrodes off before installing them in your car.\u00a0\n\nUsing a Spark Plug Cleaning Tool\u00a0\n\nThe most precise and effective method for cleaning spark plugs that is also gentle on them is by using a spark plug cleaner tool. A few varieties exist including electric-powered and ultrasonic cleaners, but the most popular is pneumatic. It contains an aggregate such as silica sand inside a cotton bag that gently dries out and busts up contaminants.\u00a0\nBegin by pressing the threaded section of the spark plug into the cleaner, then attach the device to a compressed air hose. Press the button on the device for about three seconds at a time to blast the media inside against the spark plug, then check its condition. Repeat as necessary to clean the deposits off. Blow any dust off with compressed air, then re-install your spark plug.",

        "title": "How Often Do Spark Plugs Need to Be Replaced?",
        "content": "How often should you change your spark plugs?\n\nSpark plugs are an important component of your vehicle\u2019s ignition system, and they can wear out over time. The frequency at which spark plugs need to be replaced can vary depending on the make and model of your vehicle, as well as the type of spark plugs that are being used.\nGenerally, spark plugs should be replaced every 30,000 to 100,000 miles, depending on the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for your specific vehicle. Some spark plugs may need to be replaced more frequently if they are subjected to extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or extended periods of idling. The ways that you should determine when your spark plugs need to be replaced can be broken down into two categories: recommended interval and wear.\n\nAccording to wear\n\nSpark plugs have a finite lifespan and will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. There are several factors that can contribute to the wear and tear of spark plugs, including:\n\nHeat \u2013 Spark plugs can get extremely hot during operation, and over time, this heat can cause the electrodes to wear down or even melt.\nFiring voltage \u2013 The high voltage required to create a spark can also cause wear and tear on the spark plugs over time.\nDeposits \u2013 As spark plugs fire, they can create deposits on the electrodes and insulator. These deposits can build up over time and affect the performance of the spark plugs.\nVibration \u2013 The constant vibration of the engine can also contribute to the wear and tear of spark plugs, degrading or fracturing the insulator.\n\nSigns of wear on spark plugs should compel you to change them right away so your vehicle\u2019s performance and fuel economy don\u2019t suffer.\n\nAccording to time and mileage\n\nSo, how often should you change spark plugs? The preferred method to determine how often spark plugs should be changed is at a set interval. Each manufacturer has determined the timing when they should be swapped out and a new set installed. It depends on the type of spark plugs your engine uses as well as the estimated number of miles or years in operation that they can be expected to last.\nCopper spark plugs need to be replaced the most often since the nickel alloy used wears down rather quickly. Platinum is much harder and can last much longer, and Iridium is even better at resisting normal wear. The newest type of spark plug, Ruthenium, is said to last the longest.\n\nWhen to recognize your spark plug needs changing\n\nSeveral symptoms may indicate that your spark plugs are worn out and need to be replaced:\n\nReduced engine performance: Worn spark plugs may not be able to create a strong enough spark to ignite the fuel, which can lead to reduced engine performance and a decrease in power.\n\nDifficulty starting the engine: If the spark plugs are worn out, the engine may have difficulty starting or may not start at all. It could also stall unexpectedly.\n\nPoor fuel economy: Worn spark plugs can cause the engine to run inefficiently, which can lead to poor fuel economy.\n\nMisfiring engine: Spark plugs that are worn out or malfunctioning may cause the engine to misfire, which can result in a rough idle or jerking movement when driving.\n\nCheck Engine Light: In some cases, a malfunctioning spark plug may trigger the Check Engine Light to turn on from misfire codes, catalytic converter inefficiency codes, or other performance-related DTCs.\n\nThe maintenance reminder comes on. For some newer models, your instrument cluster will indicate that a major service is required, which typically includes changing the spark plugs.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is a good idea to check your spark plugs to determine if they need to be replaced.\n\nWhat does spark plug replacement cost?\n\nThe cost to replace spark plugs can vary depending on a number of factors, including the make and model of your vehicle, the type of spark plugs being used, and where the spark plugs are being replaced.\nOn average, you can expect to pay anywhere from $3 to $30 for a single spark plug, with the majority of spark plugs falling in the $10 to $20 range. However, some high-performance spark plugs can cost significantly more.\nLabor costs can also be a significant factor in the overall cost of spark plug replacement. Depending on the complexity of the job and the hourly rate of the mechanic, you can expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $200 in labor costs.\nIn total, you can expect to pay anywhere from $100 to $500 or more to have your spark plugs replaced, depending on the factors mentioned above. However, changing the spark plugs is often a job that\u2019s doable by DIYers, saving you the cost of labor in exchange for an afternoon or evening working on your vehicle.\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Copper vs Iridium Spark Plugs: What\u2019s the Difference?",
        "content": "What Are Copper Spark Plugs?\n\nCopper spark plugs are a type of spark plug that uses a copper core electrode in the center of the spark plug. It\u2019s a thin rod that runs the length of the spark plug that\u2019s surrounded in a more durable nickel alloy, and it conducts the electrical charge from the ignition coil or spark plug wire into the combustion chamber. They\u2019ve been in use and readily available for decades.\n\nBenefits of Copper Spark Plugs\n\nCopper is a highly conductive material, which makes it an effective choice for the electrode in spark plugs. Copper spark plugs are generally less expensive than other types of spark plugs and are widely available. Other benefits for using copper spark plugs include:\n\nThey run cooler than other types of spark plugs. This is important to help control emissions such as NOx levels on older vehicles, and it prevents burning out internal components too.\nThey\u2019re extremely dependable when they\u2019re in good shape.\nCooper has a lower voltage requirement to produce a strong spark.\n\nDisadvantages of Copper Spark Plugs\n\nCopper spark plugs aren\u2019t the best option for every vehicle, though. There are downsides to consider about the lowest-cost spark plugs in the range. For example, they wear out quickly compared with other options, and for many applications, copper spark plugs will need to be changed every 20,000 to 30,000 miles. They\u2019re prone to fouling, which is when deposits build up on the electrodes that cause the spark plug to misfire or fail to fire at all. Since copper is softer than other materials used for the electrode core, it can wear out sooner.\n\nWhat are Iridium Spark Plugs?\n\nIridium spark plugs are a type of spark plug that uses an iridium electrode in place of a traditional copper electrode. They are typically more expensive than other types of spark plugs, but they can be a good choice if you\u2019re looking to extend the life of your spark plugs or improve the performance of your engine.\n\nBenefits of Iridium Spark Plugs\n\nIridium is a very hard and durable precious metal, and it has a higher melting point than copper, making it ideal for use in spark plugs. Iridium spark plugs are known for their long lifespan and their ability to deliver a strong spark, which can help to improve the performance and efficiency of an engine.\nAs well, iridium is known as the most corrosion-resistant element, not just of the metals but of all elements, so it lasts longer when exposed to reactive compounds in exhaust gases.\nBecause of these characteristics, iridium spark plugs can be manufactured with a finer tip to concentrate the spark better without worry about premature wear or failure. Overall, you can expect iridium spark plugs to last around 100,000 miles when they\u2019re properly paired with your vehicle\u2019s engine. And depending on the vehicle, you might be able to improve your power and reduce fuel economy modestly with iridium plugs over copper.\n\nDisadvantages of Iridium Spark Plugs\n\nOf course, using a precious metal that\u2019s much rarer than copper comes at a price. You can expect to pay around triple the price of copper spark plugs, and it doesn\u2019t always improve how well your engine runs. And if the iridium is damaged, the benefits can be negated almost immediately.\n\nWhat to Consider When Buying a Spark Plug for Your Car\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for spark plugs, there are a few factors to consider to ensure you\u2019re getting parts that not only keep your car performing at its best but will maintain its reliability too.\nFirst, consider the compatibility. Some engines can use copper spark plugs, especially older models. Many newer cars cannot operate as designed using copper-core spark plugs, and they will experience issues with dependability. Most cars that take copper spark plugs can use iridium plugs, but they need to be the right size, voltage, and heat range. Only use spark plugs that are compatible with your engine.\nPerformance should also be in mind. Will you get any noticeable benefits by changing up from copper to iridium? If you have a high-performance model, it\u2019s likely worth the investment.\nMaintenance cost should also factor in. Since iridium plugs are more expensive, the upfront cost is higher but they won\u2019t need to be changed as often.",

It helps to understand a spark plug\u2019s construction.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe insulator is a porcelain section that funnels the spark into the combustion chamber.\u00a0\u00a0The terminal allows the spark plug wire or ignition coil to fit snugly and securely onto the spark plug body.\u00a0The housing is the metal body, typically made of steel, that\u2019s threaded and is tightened into the cylinder head.\u00a0The center electrode is a rod that reaches from the top terminal through to the bottom to conduct the electricity that creates the spark. It\u2019s normally made of copper coated in nickel alloy.\u00a0The spark jumps from the electrode center tip attached to the center electrode. This is where spark plug differences come from.\u00a0\u00a0The spark bridges to the curved ground electrode. While it\u2019s made of steel, it can also be coated with a more conductive material.\u00a0\u00a0\nEssentially, the center electrode and ground electrode are where you\u2019ll find the major differences between the types, like iridium and platinum plugs.\u00a0\n\nPlatinum Spark Plugs\u00a0\n\nFor a standard copper spark plug, the electrodes are often covered in nickel alloy for durability. However, platinum spark plugs are a major upgrade. Platinum is a much harder metal than the commonplace nickel alloy, which comes with a few benefits.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlatinum holds its shape for much longer, so you can expect longer intervals between spark plug replacements. Most vehicles will last from 60,000 to 100,000 miles.\u00a0\u00a0The platinum tip has a higher melting point at around 3,215 F, meaning it erodes at a slower rate.\u00a0They resist fouling. Since platinum burns hotter, it burns away deposits that would otherwise foul the spark plug.\u00a0\nWhen you\u2019re looking for platinum spark plugs, you may come across a couple of options. A single platinum plug will have a platinum center electrode with a nickel alloy ground. A double platinum spark plug also has a platinum spot on the ground electrode.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIridium Spark Plugs\u00a0\n\nAnother variety of spark plugs uses iridium instead of either nickel alloy or platinum. The center electrode is iridium for single iridium spark plugs while both the ground and center electrodes are coated for double iridium plugs.\u00a0\nThe benefits of iridium for a spark plug include:\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s as much as eight times stronger than platinum, so iridium can have a sharper center electrode that conducts a more durable, powerful spark.\u00a0Iridium is much harder than even platinum, so it resists wear for up to 25% more lifespan.\u00a0Iridium has a melting point over 4,400 F which ensures it can handle the hottest ignition systems.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIridium vs. Platinum: Which is Better?\u00a0\n\nWhich spark plugs are the best performing for your vehicle? The answer is\u2026 it depends. Platinum has properties that are better than copper spark plugs in many ways, and iridium spark plugs have benefits above those that platinum offers. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can or should change the type of spark plug you use in your engine.\u00a0\nWhen your vehicle is manufactured, the original spark plugs have been chosen by an engineer to make sure it runs smoothly, operates in the right temperature range, and will last between intervals.\u00a0\nIf your vehicle was built with copper spark plugs, there are typically options to upgrade to either platinum or iridium since they can outperform the originals. If your car has platinum plugs from factory, then it\u2019s possible to upgrade to iridium, but you should never downgrade to copper. Likewise, iridium plugs from the factory should never be downgraded to platinum or copper, or you could risk both performance and longevity issues.",

        "content": "How Spark Plugs Work\n\nProvided it has a gas engine, your vehicle likely has an ignition system with a some of the following components. Diesel engines almost never have spark plugs.\nUnder the hood, there is a battery. This battery stores an electrical current. When you start the ignition, an electrical current moves into an induction coil. This, in turn, increases the electrical voltage to a usable level for the spark plugs. High-voltage electricity then moves through plug wires and ends up in the spark plugs.\nSpark plugs typically have two electrodes that facilitate a spark. When sufficiently high voltage hits these electrodes, a spark jumps across. What constitutes sufficiently high voltage varies, depending on the design of the plug and cylinder compression.\nThe plug\u2019s spark ignites the air/fuel mixture inside each engine cylinder. Naturally, sparks must occur at the right time, when each cylinder\u2019s piston is in the correct position. When functioning properly, spark plugs allow for a smooth burn of fuel.\nSpark plugs also play a role in removing heat from a vehicle\u2019s combustion chamber. To do so, each plug transfers heat into the\u00a0engine\u2019s cooling system. This requires a delicate balance. That is, the plug must remain sufficiently cool to stop premature ignition while being hot enough not to foul.\nMost spark plugs have a code printed on them. While the code varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, it typically tells you the plug\u2019s design, heat rating, thread diameter, and hexagon spanner width. You may be able to determine the distance between electrodes by deciphering the code.\n\nWhere to Find Spark Plugs\n\nToday\u2019s vehicles usually have the same number of spark plugs as cylinders. Accordingly, if you drive a six-cylinder vehicle, you probably have six spark plugs. You should know, though, that a few vehicles on the road have more than one plug per cylinder. Even though this design is rare, you should check your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual to determine how many plugs your car has, just in case.\nBefore cars became increasingly complex, locating spark plugs was easy. After all, plugs usually sit on top or to the side of the engine. With vacuum hoses, filters, wiring and other components, though, the engine compartment has become tight. Therefore, you may have to move a few parts, like\u00a0Coil-on-Plug (COP) ignition coils, of the way to access your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs. Often, plugs live beneath the engine cover.\nA vehicle repair manual can likely tell you how to access your spark plugs. If the instructions are not clear, you can look at an OEM diagram online. Alternatively, you may want to invest in an\u00a0aftermarket service manual\u00a0before working on your car, truck, or SUV. Many manuals give you step-by-step instructions on locating and removing plugs. These instructions typically tell you which components you need to move out of the way.\n\nHow to Test a Spark Plug\n\nHaving functioning spark plugs is essential to a working engine. After all, a bad spark plug can make your engine run roughly, perform sluggishly, misfire, or stall. If you have a faulty spark plug, your\u00a0Check Engine Light may illuminate, although it sometimes may not. Accordingly, it is good to know how to check spark plugs.\nWhen checking your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs, be sure to look at every plug. Again, you probably have as many plugs as you have cylinders. If you do not check all plugs, you may miss a problem in one of the cylinders.\nAfter removing the spark plug, visually inspect the plug. The following is a guide that may tell you the health of your plugs:\n\nNothing Noteworthy:\u00a0If your plugs look like they did when you installed them, everything is probably fine. You can probably reinstall the plug and continue to use it.\nRed-Coated and Normal:\u00a0An otherwise normal spark plug may have a red coating. Usually, this coating comes from fuel additives and is nothing to worry about. You can likely continue to use the plug.\nStructural Damage:\u00a0If you did not\u00a0install your spark plugs correctly, they may be sitting too low in the combustion chamber. This can cause structural damage that necessitates replacement of the plug. You may also need to inspect other parts of the engine for signs of damage.\nDetonation Damage:\u00a0You can see this damage on the electrodes. This often happens when you do not use sufficiently high octane fuel. A plug with detonation damage requires replacement. You may also want to schedule a\u00a0tune up.\nCarbon Buildup:\u00a0If carbon accumulates on the plug\u2019s electrodes, you may have bad wiring or a leak in the injectors. In addition to replacing the plug, you should inspect the thermostat for damage.\n\nHow to read your spark plug\u2019s condition\n\nShop Testing Equipment\n\nHow to Use a Spark Plug Tester\n\n1. Prep & Safety\n\nMake sure to wear gloves and other appropriate safety gear. You will need to access the spark plugs by removing any components on top of them according to the proper procedure for your car. Then, disconnect the plug from it\u2019s lead wire.\n\n2. Connect the Tester to the Lead Wire\n\nAttach the tester\u2019s lead to the plug wire. The long metal end of the tester should fit into the wire just like the end of spark plug did earlier.\n\n3. Connect the Tester to the Lead Wire\n\nConnect the boot-end of the tester to the spark plug by sliding it over the end just like how the plug wire was on it before.\n\n4. Crank the Engine\n\nIf the engine starts and the plug is functioning properly, the tester\u2019s light will illuminate. Repeat this process for each plug as necessary.\n\nYou may wonder what\u2019s the best tool for testing spark plugs?\u202fBecause spark plug testers come in a variety of styles, which one is right for you probably depends on personal preference. Fortunately, most types, including in-line spark testers, are affordable. When using a tester, though, be sure you wear\u00a0safety gloves\u00a0to avoid a shock. Furthermore, always follow operational instructions carefully.\n\nStaying\u00a0on Top",

        "content": "Spark plug replacement cost\n\nThere are two components to spark plug replacement cost: parts and labor. Spark plugs vary depending on the vehicle, but more so on the type of technology they use for the center electrode\u2019s core. Here are the different types and a range of prices for each:\n\nCopper spark plugs are the most common and cost-effective with the majority under $4 per spark plug\u00a0\nPlatinum spark plugs are more conductive, and most options are under $6 each.\u00a0\nDouble Platinum spark plugs use platinum for both the center and ground electrode. They\u2019re more expensive, ranging from around $5 to $20 per spark plug.\u00a0\nIridium provides more dependable spark, and the price ranges from about $8 to $30 each.\u00a0\nDouble Iridium require less energy, and they\u2019re a good price point at around $8 to $15 each.\u00a0\nRuthenium spark plugs are longer lasting and burn more completely, and command around $15 to $209 each.\u00a0\n\nHow much does it cost to replace a spark plug yourself?\u00a0\nIf you drive a compact car with a four-cylinder engine, an average set of platinum spark plugs will cost you about $32 or so. A six-cylinder will cost around $48, and a V8 will be around $64 for the parts alone. The exception is for unique models like the 5.7L HEMI engine from Stellantis. With two spark plugs per cylinder, you can expect to pay around $130 in parts alone.\u00a0\n\nHow much does it cost for a professional spark plug replacement?\u00a0\n\nIf it\u2019s a task you aren\u2019t comfortable doing on your own, spark plug replacement cost at a repair shop will have labor costs higher than the parts. For instance, a set of four spark plugs in a compact car will likely be around $50 to $80 to install.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome vehicles need an intake plenum or other parts removed to access the spark plugs, and the price goes up commensurately.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat works best for you?\u00a0\n\nBut if you\u2019re inexperienced and hesitant to try the job yourself, it could be safer to have a repair shop, like AutoZone\u2019s Preferred Shops, do it for you.

        "title": "Spark Plugs vs Glow Plugs: What\u2019s the difference?",
        "content": "In gasoline engines, the fuel is typically introduced to the cylinder at the same time as the air, during the intake stroke. This allows the fuel to vaporize and mix with the air during the compression stroke. Then, the spark plug generates a spark that ignites the fuel for the combustion stroke.\u00a0\nDiesel engines introduce the fuel at the tail end of the compression stroke, when the air is almost fully compressed in the cylinder. The low flash point, or point at which the fuel explodes, of diesel fuel causes the heat of the compressed air to initiate the explosion of the diesel fuel and power the combustion stroke.\u00a0\nThe combustion stroke in both types of engines begins when the fuel and air mixture explodes in the compressed cylinder. A gasoline engine requires a spark plug to initiate combustion, while a diesel relies on the heat of the compressed air to ignite the diesel fuel.\u00a0\n\nWhat are spark plugs?\u00a0\n\nSpark plugs are made of ceramic and metal, with the metal acting as a conductor for electricity and the ceramic acting as an insulator, keeping the electricity from touching things it shouldn\u2019t.\u00a0\nOne end of the spark plug has a metal terminal that connects to your ignition coil, accepting the high voltage charge for every ignition event. The other end of the spark plug has an electrode sticking out past the tip, and an anode that hovers over the electrode to facilitate the spark.\u00a0\nThe spark plug has threads on the electrode end to screw into the top of the cylinder head, with a gasket or crush washer and helps to seal the cylinder. It must have a perfect seal because of the extreme pressures and temperatures that exist in the combustion chamber.\u00a0\nThe electricity flows from the ignition coil, into the terminal of the spark plug and through the metal core of the spark plug, ending at the electrode, where it arcs through the air and returns through the anode. This happens every time the cylinder fires, which will typically be thousands of times per minute.\u00a0\nThe main difference in ranges on spark plugs is in the material that makes up the electrode. Copper was the predominant material for years, but recent developments in spark plug technology have introduced longer-lasting spark plugs made of platinum and iridium.\u00a0\nThe distance between the electrode and the anode on a spark plug is called the gap and every engine has a specification, usually measured in thousands of an inch, for the distance of the gap. It\u2019s important to measure your gaps using a spark plug gap gauge before you install them, as a bad gap can impact the performance of the plugs.\u00a0\nDepending on the layout of your engine in the engine bay, doing a spark plug replacement can be a fairly easy job.\u00a0\n\nHow To Change Spark Plugs & Spark Plug Wires- AutoZone Car Care\n\nWhat are glow plugs?\u00a0\n\nIn a diesel engine, combustion is initiated by the heat of the compressed air once the fuel is added. When a diesel engine is very cold it may require some preheating to bring the combustion chamber up to a temperature where combustion can occur and modern glow plug designs can also work with the engine to reduce smoke and other harmful emissions, regardless of the ambient temperature.\u00a0\nGlow plugs are made of metal and have a threaded section that screws into the cylinder head. Inside the tip of the glow plug, there is a heating coil that, when charged with electricity, becomes hot and glows.\u00a0\nAt the end of the compression stroke, the fuel is introduced through the fuel injectors to the combustion chamber, where it vaporizes and mixes with the air before combusting. The function of the glow plug is to assist in vaporizing the fuel and prompting combustion when ambient temperatures are too low for compression ignition.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce the engine is at operating temperature, the glow plug can be idle, but many vehicles use them to fine-tune emissions by maintaining consistent conditions inside the cylinder.\u00a0\nWhat is the difference between spark plugs and glow plugs?\u00a0\nThe difference between spark plugs and glow plugs comes down to the combustion cycle of gas versus diesel engines. Gas engines use spark ignition to induce combustion, whereas diesels use compression ignition to prompt combustion.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe spark plugs in your gasoline engine emit a spark for every combustion event in the cylinder, meaning that they will cycle many millions of times over their lifespan.\u00a0\nThe glow plugs in your diesel engine will operate mostly on startup, or during certain conditions to improve emissions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nChoosing the right plugs for your car\n\nSpark plug and glow plug technology has come a long way in the last 50 years, utilizing more efficient designs and materials that improve the efficiency and longevity of the plugs.\u00a0\nSpark plugs are now available in several ranges, utilizing exotic materials like iridium and platinum in the electrodes of higher-end models, while less-expensive ranges still use copper in their construction.\u00a0\n\nThe more expensive iridium or platinum spark plugs can be very close in price to their copper counterparts, so it may be more economical for you to purchase the higher-end plugs for your car, since an iridium spark plug will typically last longer and provide more consistent spark. Many are rated for up to 100,000 miles of use.\u00a0\nSpark plugs for most vehicles will range in price from less than $10 to around $30 for the higher-end iridium plugs, so the cost to replace a set is not high, when you think of the length of service they provide. It\u2019s a good idea to replace all the spark plugs in your vehicle at the same time, to promote consistency within your engine.\u00a0\nGlow plugs have approximately the same price range as spark plugs, ranging from around $10 to $30 for most vehicles. They will also typically have a long service life of 100,000 miles or more, so if your diesel-powered vehicle is nearing that mileage, consider doing a glow plug replacement. It can improve emissions and the efficiency of your vehicle.",

        "title": "How Much Should a Tune-Up Cost?",
        "content": "What is a\u00a0Tune-Up?\n\nEssentially, a tune-up is a catch-all phrase for inspecting and performing preventative maintenance on the parts of your vehicle that are the most likely to need replacing. The reason why the term is so vague is that what exactly is being checked and what will need to be replaced depends heavily on your car, where you have driven it, and other factors specific to your car and the way you drive it.\nThere are many pros to getting a tune-up, and consistent maintenance on your vehicle will help it last longer and keep the price of overall maintenance down. Failing to keep on top of basic maintenance can result in costly repairs that could have been avoided. Maintaining your vehicle can also help performance and fuel economy.\nWhen you go in for a tune-up, it is likely that one of the components checked will be the air filter. Generally speaking,\u00a0an air filter should be replaced at least once a year, though depending on where you drive your vehicle (for example, if you drive on a lot of dirt roads), you may need to have it replaced more often.\nIf an air filter is not replaced when necessary, the engine will not receive the amount of air it needs to run optimally. This in turn will cause the air-fuel mixture inside of your engine to run rich, which means that it has too much fuel in the fuel-to-air ratio. Not only does this waste fuel, it can potentially cause other parts of your vehicle to fail earlier than necessary.\nIt used to be that when you asked about tune-up prices, you were asking about the cost to replace the spark plugs. Older vehicles typically needed the spark plugs replaced much more often than modern cars \u2013 as frequently as once a year. Although spark plugs last many years longer today, spark plugs should still be checked or replaced if necessary during a tune-up.\nA tune-up should also involve\u00a0looking at the spark plugs\u00a0and cleaning them, but only during intervals with an in-depth inspection or when they\u2019re scheduled for replacement. It\u2019s unfeasible to take them out during every oil change since that would jack up the tune-up cost unnecessarily. If you have an older vehicle with manual ignition, a tune-up may involve looking at the rotor and the distributor cap. Fuel filters may need to be replaced during a tune-up, as well as spark plugs, wires, the PCV valve, or the oxygen sensor.\nAgain, the nature of tune-ups depends on your car. If you happen to have a car that runs\u00a0platinum spark plugs, as is common with most modern vehicles, it is likely they will not need to be replaced as often as the general variety of spark plug found in older vehicles. If you have an electronic ignition, you are not going to need to have a rotor or distributor cap replaced as these do not exist in cars with electronic ignition systems.\nDepending on your situation, a tune-up may also reveal bigger problems with your vehicle that need to be addressed. The mechanic should\u00a0do a check of all your vehicle\u2019s general systems, such as the brakes, clutch, and air conditioning systems. Different cars require different levels of maintenance, so it is important to check your owner\u2019s manual to advise the mechanic to look at certain systems during the tune-up.\nYou may also choose to have an oil change at the time of your tune-up but remember that\u00a0an oil change should happen multiple times a year\u00a0while a tune-up typically only needs to happen once a year or even less frequently.\n\nHow Much Does a Tune-up\u00a0Cost?\n\nYour car tune-up cost depends on multiple factors. The cost of a very basic tune-up will run between $40 and $150 depending on where you are. This variety of tune-up tends to focus on spark plugs alone and\u00a0spark plug replacement. However, if you want a full tune-up involving an oil change, air filter check, distributor cap check, rotor check, PCV valve check, fuel filter check, and all systems getting a cursory examination, this variety of tune-up may cost between $200 and $800.\nThe overall cost of your tune-up will depend on the hourly rate of mechanics in your area as well as the cost of parts that need to be replaced. It is typically cheaper to get a tune-up at a regular repair shop as compared to a dealership.\nIf you happen to have an older vehicle or a classic vehicle, expect to pay more for a tune-up. Particularly if your car is over 120,000 miles, you may be looking at a cost of $500 to $1200 or more depending on what exactly needs to be replaced on the car.\nIt is a good idea to comparison shop before taking your car in for a tune-up. Make sure that when you call the mechanic asking for a price quote that you ask exactly what is included in the tune-up. You may also want to ask about discounts since some shops offer coupons or incentives relatively frequently, particularly for new customers.\nIf you really want to save money, many people do basic tune-ups at home. Keep in mind most cars today have an onboard diagnostic system that can be checked for misfire codes, indicating that spark plugs are worn out or fouled. However, you need a scan tool to check up on them. Basic maintenance of spark plugs and air filters can be done at home for a fraction of the price, though.\n\nWhat are Some\u00a0Signs My Car Needs a Tune-up?\n\nWhile tune-ups should be part of the yearly basic maintenance of your vehicle, there are some signs that your car may need to be taken in immediately for one. If you notice that your average gas mileage has dropped considerably, it is time to schedule a tune-up. Other signs that it is time for a tune-up include a\u00a0lit Check Engine Light, frequent stalling, strange knocking noises coming from the engine, or general lack of performance while driving your vehicle.\n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone",

        "title": "How Spark Plugs Work",
        "content": "What Do Spark Plugs Do?\n\nThe fundamental function of a spark plug is to aid in the combustion process of your engine. Basically, the plug fits into your car engine\u2019s cylinder head and is connected to the ignition coil. The ignition coil then generates the high voltage needed to create the spark from the plug. When the spark occurs, the fuel ignites, allowing your engine to run. However, if the plug is damaged, then there is no spark to ignite the fuel and your vehicle\u2019s engine will not run. Therefore, while it is small and fragile, the spark plug is one of the most critical elements in a car.\n\nHow Does a Spark Plug Work\n\nThe ignition process of your vehicle does not begin with a spark plug. Actually, the process starts at the gas tank. Essentially, the fuel pump moves the gasoline from the tank to the fuel injectors. Then, as the fuel reaches the throttle body, the engine\u2019s air intake system sucks oxygen into the cylinders. The fuel and air are mixed, forming a highly combustible relationship, and injected into the cylinders, where the ignition coil releases the appropriate\u202fvoltage to create a spark from the plug, which ignites a small explosion in the spark channel to power the engine. This process occurs at a rapid rate, typically thousands of times per minute, and the spark plug is the backbone.\n\nWhat Type of Spark Plugs Do I Need?\n\nThere is a lot of debate about the power differences between different spark plug electrode materials. All of the discussion is mostly\u202fnonsense. The best judge of which spark plug is best is your vehicle manufacturer. Therefore, when in need of a spark plug replacement, trust your owner\u2019s manual above all else. However, that being said, there are several differences between the top three spark plug materials: copper, iridium alloy and platinum.\n\n1. Copper\n\nCopper electrodes are among the most popular and find the most use in combustion engines. They are stronger conductors than iridium and platinum, and they are often used in high-performance or modified engines. However, these plugs do not last as long as the other two metals, typically wearing down or needing replacement about every 20,000 miles. Despite their shorter lifespan, these plugs are among the cheapest to replace.\n\n2. Iridium alloy\n\nIf you are willing to spend a few extra bucks, then you might consider iridium allow spark plugs. While these options do not have the highest conductivity level, they do\u202flast nearly twice as long, 40,000 miles, as copper plugs. It is necessary to note that these plugs are not recommended for modified engines.\n\n3. Platinum\n\nPlatinum spark plugs are not recommended for every engine. However, they are known for having superior resistance to time-borne corrosion, and they have a similar life expectancy to iridium alloy. Although, these plugs are typically recommended for only newer vehicles with electronic ignition systems that are distributor-based or even DIS systems.\n\nAgain, while there are a few varieties of spark plugs available, they will not all be right for your particular vehicle\u2019s engine. Therefore, before going out and buying a replacement plug, review the recommendations from your vehicle manufacturer found in your owner\u2019s manual.\n\nWhat Heat Range Spark Plug\u00a0Should I Use\n\nThe discussion of spark plug heat ranges is typically only necessary for vehicle manufacturers and those savvy car owners who have modified their vehicles for performance increases. For those drivers, it is necessary to understand the different ranges and which range is right for your car.\nThere is a common misconception that spark plugs generate heat, but this is not true. In fact, the entire point of the design of the plug is to channel heat away from the tip, which is where the length of the insulator mass comes into play. Essentially, the way that heat range works is determined by the length of the insulator. For example, shorter insulator masses have a cooler heat range than longer ones. For proper function, the tip of the plug must remain cool enough to prevent preignition but hot enough to maintain self-cleaning.\nWhen deciding on a proper heat range and plug, you need to understand how hot your car\u2019s fuel burns. This is a measurement that is\u202fimpossible to change, regardless of modifications. Therefore, it is typically recommended to stick to the factory recommendations when it comes to choosing spark plugs.\n\nWhat is the\u00a0Spark Plug Gap?\n\nFor optimum engine performance, it is not enough to select the appropriate\u202fplug and heat range. You must also set the gap to the precise distance. Again, you can review your vehicle\u2019s manual to determine the proper\u202fgap, and you can use tools specifically designed to set the plug gap.\nWhile most vehicle owners don\u2019t think twice about their vehicle\u2019s spark plugs until something goes wrong, you now know the answer to the question, \u201chow does a spark plug work?\u201d Therefore, with your newfound knowledge, the next time you hear your engine knocking or struggling to ignite, you will know why, and you can then go out and buy the correct plug for your car.\n\nShop for ignition parts at AutoZone",

        "content": "How To Change a Spark Plug On a Lawn Mower\n\n1. Pay Attention to Signs Your Spark Plug Needs Changing\n\nSpark plugs aren\u2019t meant to last forever. Over time, they wear out, which affects how the mower\u2019s engine runs. You should replace this component either every season or every 100 hours of use to ensure your engine stays running smoothly.\nHowever, you may have to change the spark plug in between the recommended times due to damage. How can you tell there\u2019s something wrong? Here are common signs that you should take a look at your mower\u2019s engine:\n\nFuel efficiency has significantly decreased\nDifficulty getting the mower started\nEngine suddenly stops running\n\n2. Purchase the Correct Type of Spark Plug\n\nSpark plugs aren\u2019t universal; you have to make sure that you buy one that fits your mower. You can consult your owners\u2019 manual to determine the types your lawn mower can use or take a look at the plug\u2019s ceramic insulator, which usually has the number printed on it.\n\n3. Position Lawn Mower\n\nBefore you get to work, set your mower on a flat, stable surface. A garage floor or porch is perfect. This gives you unfettered access to the engine while ensuring your safety, as you may be injured if the mower shifts or falls while you\u2019re performing maintenance.\nYou should also take this time to gather the necessary tools:\n\nScrewdriver\nSpark plug socket\nDrive socket wrench in 1/2 inches or 3/8 inches, whichever is appropriate for your machine\nNew spark plug\nFeeler gauge\nSpray-on cleaner\nWire brush\nSturdy knife\n\nMake sure the engine is cool enough to work on before you proceed. If you used the mower earlier, give it half an hour at least for the parts to cool down. Otherwise, you risk burning yourself on the metal pieces.\n\n4. Disconnect Spark Plug Lead\n\nIf your engine has a cover, use the screwdriver to remove it. You\u2019ll then need to disconnect the spark plug lead, also called the ignition cable. This is a wire that links the plug to the voltage source and distributor, thereby providing electricity. Make sure the connection is fully severed for your safety.\nYou can also take this time to examine the ignition cable. Time and use can lead to wear, which may affect your mower\u2019s performance. Look for damaged jackets on the wires; if you see broken plastic, its time for a replacement.\n\n5. Remove Spark Plug\n\nFit the spark plug socket over the plug and turn counterclockwise to loosen. If you\u2019re having trouble ratcheting, don\u2019t force it, as this may cause damage. Instead, apply lubricant and allow to soak for a few minutes. You should then be able to easily remove the plug.\nIt\u2019s important that you specifically use a spark plug socket, as these are specifically designed to protect the ceramic insulator. Attempting to remove or install a spark plug with inappropriate tools can result in damage.\n\n6. Clean and Inspect Plug\n\nThe plug will likely be coated in build-up, so be sure to clean it using the spray-on cleaner and your wire brush. If you encounter stubborn deposits, use the knife to scrape or chip them away.\nNext, take a look at the component. If the part is in good condition and there\u2019s still time left on its advised use period, you can put it back. However, if you notice any burned electrodes or cracked ceramic, you need a new piece.\n\n7. Adjust Gap Using a Spark Plug Gauge\n\nBefore you can begin installation, you need to make sure the plug has the correct gap. Measure the gap between the curved and straight electrodes using the spark plug gauge. If you have the correct size for your make and model, it should only need minor adjustment. To adjust the gap, carefully bend the curved electrode with the gauge.\n\n8. Install New Spark Plug\n\nPut the new plug into place and manually turn clockwise. Once the threads catch, use the socket to tighten further. Be careful not to overtighten or you can break the more delicate parts. To safely install the plug, only rachet until it stops going down, then give it one last quarter turn.\n\n9. Reconnect Lead\n\nNow that your spark plug is back in place, reconnect the lead. If you\u2019ve gotten a new cable, this is a good time to install it. Replace the hood of your mower and tighten the screws. Congratulations; you\u2019ve successfully changed your spark plug.\n\n10. Dispose of Damaged Parts\n\nIf you\u2019ve done a full replacement, not just cleaning, you now need to dispose of the old parts. Plugs are safe to throw in the garbage, which you are welcome to do. However, if you have other auto scrap on hand or don\u2019t mind waiting until you do, you can actually sell these parts to a scrap yard to make some extra cash.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve learned how to change a spark plug in a lawn mower, you can keep your equipment running smoothly without having to hire someone else for maintenance. With this skill in your repertoire, you can look forward to more cash in your wallet, an efficient mower, and a beautiful lawn.",

        "title": "How To Gap Spark Plugs",
        "content": "When replacing your spark plugs, your choice of gapping tool matters. Those coin-style gap tools may not always be the best option. While those tools are OK for traditional copper/nickel spark plugs, many plug manufacturers have moved towards precious metals. These precious metals, such as platinum, iridium, and ruthenium, are harder than their copper/nickel counterparts which allows the center electrode design to be smaller, typically under 1 mmm in diameter. These precious metal tips are more resistant to wear and have a higher melting point than the larger copper/nickel tips, but they are more fragile, especially when gapping. Any lateral force applied to the tiny center electrode could cause the tip to break off. Therefore, before you go using a coin gapper on any spark plug, make sure you understand how it works and why a precise gap matters.\nWhy Gapping Matters\n\nThe distance of the gap on a spark plug depends on the voltage and amperage generated by the ignition coil. The gap specification is determined by the vehicle manufacturer during engine design and is commonly found in the vehicle owner\u2019s manual or the emission sticker under the hood. The accuracy of the gap is critical to an engine\u2019s operation and efficiency. However, let\u2019s further explain for those asking, \u201cwhat happens when plugs aren\u2019t gapped properly?\u201d\nSpark plugs that do not have the proper gap lead to premature wear, ignition system stress, and even cylinder misfires. If the gap is too wide the ignition system components are required to work harder to jump across the extended gap leading to spark plug, ignition coil, and control module failures. It\u2019s also possible the spark could be \u201cblown out\u201d in highly turbulent combustion chambers. A gap that is too small will not fully ignite the air/fuel mixture leading to low power and higher tailpipe emissions.\n\nCheck Pre-Gapped Plugs\n\nPre-gapped spark plugs often create a little confusion or over-confidence. While it is true that many spark plug manufacturers will say that their plugs are indeed pre-gapped, that does not necessarily mean that the plugs are gapped for your specific engine or vehicle. Pre-gapped only means that the device is pre-measured to work in a variety of engines. Therefore, always measure the gap to ensure maximum efficiency and longevity of the plug in your specific engine.\nThere are a few types of gapping tools you can use.\n\nUsing a Feeler Gauge or Wire-Type Gap Gauge\n\nNewer spark plugs, those designed with precious metals, should only be manipulated with a feeler or wire-type gap gauge. While a coin-style tool can be used in a pinch, albeit cautiously, it is far too easy to damage the iridium or platinum metals, which decreases the lifespan of the plug. Also, wire and feeler gauge tools provide a more accurate measurement than coin-style devices because they are designed with a linear surface. Additionally, the linear advantage of these tools provides a way to check the squareness and thickness of the gap, which is difficult with the coin tool. Beyond more accurate measuring, these tools also have a better mechanism for expanding the gap than found in coin-style gauges.\n\nHow to Use a Coin-Style Gap Tool\n\nCoin-style gap tools are some of the most common and readily available tools on the market. However, not everyone understands how to use these devices properly, and not every spark plug is designed with this type of tool in mind. Therefore, you will want to locate in your car\u2019s manual the type of spark plug you should be using. If the plug uses precious metals, like iridium, platinum, or ruthenium, then you want to avoid using a coin-style gapper, but if your vehicle uses copper/nickel plugs, then this tool is fine. Although you must use it correctly.\n\n1. Insert ramp between electrodes\n\nThe coin tool has a little ramp going around its perimeter that is labeled with measurements. You want to place the narrowest end of the slope between the electrodes of the plug and slowly rotate until you feel a slight resistance. Then, stop. Look at the measurement to determine the current gap.\n\n2. If Too Wide\n\nIf the measurement that is revealed is too wide for your engine, then you need to decrease the gap. Thankfully, this is not difficult. Tap the gapped side of the plug against a hard surface gently. If you do this too hard, you can damage the porcelain or the insulator.\n\n3. If Too Narrow\n\nThis is when most people make a mistake and use the ramp to widen the gap. Don\u2019t do that. The ramp is only used to measure the gap, nothing else. The appropriate way to widen the gap with the coin tool is to use the predrilled hole. While it might appear to be a place for a key ring, the hole is actually an opening for inserting the ground electrode. Inside of the whole is a lip or edge, which is called the gapper. Hook the ground electrode onto the rim and pry the gap open with the tool. However, be gentle so that you don\u2019t damage the integrity of the plug.\n\n4. Remeasure and Adjust\n\nBe sure to check the gap frequently while making these minor adjustments. A little pressure goes a long way, and if you are not careful, you might adjust too much and weaken the ground electrode strap. Tap or pry a little, and then measure. It is better to work incrementally than to try and force it in one maneuver.",

        "title": "The Tools Needed To Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "When To Change Your Vehicle\u2019s Spark Plugs\n\nWhether you are an automotive enthusiast or just prefer to avoid car trouble, occasionally replacing spark plugs is part of regular maintenance. Put simply, if you ignore your car\u2019s plugs, you are asking for trouble.\nSpark plug manufacturers design their products both to be durable and have a long life. You may not need to worry about your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs for 30,000 miles or more. Still, you should not forget to replace your spark plugs when the time comes.\nAn old, damaged, or ineffective spark plug may cause your vehicle\u2019s engine to misfire. Alternatively, old plugs can cause the emissions from your engine to increase. Even worse, a bad spark plug can leave you stranded somewhere you would rather not be.\n\nHow to Tell if Your Spark Plugs are Bad\n\nIf any of the following applies to your vehicle, it may be time for a change:\nYour owner\u2019s manual recommends changing spark plugsYour car\u2019s engine misfiresYour check engine light illuminatesYour car has difficulty startingYour car accelerates slowlyYour car\u2019s engine idles roughly\nLearn more about bad spark plug symptoms.\nWhile other problems and maintenance issues can cause the above situations to occur, spark plugs are often to blame. If changing your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs does not remedy your vehicle\u2019s engine problems, you may need to do some troubleshooting. Still, swapping out bad spark plugs often fixes issues with your vehicle\u2019s overall performance.\n\nHow To Choose the Right Spark Plug Tools\n\nOn most vehicles, replacing spark plugs is not a difficult project. In fact, you can likely do the job in just a couple hours on the weekend. Nevertheless, you need the right tools to replace spark plugs correctly. While you may run into problems, the following tools are often essential for achieving professional-grade results.\n\n1. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual\n\nBefore you can replace spark plugs, you need to know where to find them and how to access them. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual is an excellent resource. If the manual does not shed sufficient light on the subject, you may want to invest in a vehicle-specific aftermarket manual. Chilton and Haynes have some excellent manuals that give you a step-by-step guide to locating and replacing spark plugs as well as a list of tools to replace spark plugs. \n\n2. A spark plug socket\n\nTo remove spark plugs, you need a spark plug removal tool that grabs and twists the spark plugs inside your vehicle\u2019s engine. Because spark plugs can be in awkward positions, you may also need an extension for your spark plug socket. Choosing one that locks in place may help you avoid the sort of aggravation that occasionally accompanies a spark plug replacement.\n\n3. A wobble socket\n\nIf a standard socket does not work, choosing a wobble socket may be a better idea. Wobble sockets are often essential equipment for removing iridium spark plugs. The wobble socket is also smaller than traditional spark plug sockets, allowing you to access tight spaces easier. If a regular socket simply does not fit into the confined area in which you must work, trying a wobble socket may be a better approach. \n\n4. Spark plug boot puller pliers\n\nOccasionally, spark plug boots fuse with your vehicle\u2019s plugs. If this is the case, you do not want to pull on the wires themselves. Doing so may damage the wires, potentially rendering them unusable after your spark plug replacement. Instead, use spark plug boot puller pliers to gently work boots free. \n\n5. A flexible handle ratchet\n\nSometimes you must be a bit creative to remove spark plugs. If your vehicle\u2019s engine configuration requires you to work in tight or bizarre places, using a flexible handle ratchet allows you to remove spark plugs without standing on your head. Using one in conjunction with a wobble socket may be the perfect solution for removing your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs from areas where space is a premium.  \n\n6. A torque wrench\n\nWhen replacing spark plugs, how much you tighten each plug matters. If you do not tighten plugs sufficiently, you risk a bad connection. Too much tightening, though, can destroy both your spark plugs and your engine. Therefore, use a torque wrench and manufacturer specifications to tighten each spark plug appropriately. \n\n7. A spark plug gap gauge\n\nYour new spark plugs need the correct gap to function optimally. Rather than estimating gap, use a spark plug gap gauge to space your new plugs perfectly. To correctly use the gap gauge, first consult manufacturer recommendations. Then, place the gauge between the plug\u2019s center and its electrodes, lining it up to meet manufacturer specifications.\n\nOther Things You May Need\n\nWhile these items are not necessary to every spark plug replacement, they  can certainly help:\nAnti-Seize Lubricant: If your plugs were really hard to remove, it might be because the previous installer didn\u2019t use an anti-seize product. When you apply this product to the spark plugs before installing them, you reduce the risk of having plugs fuse to engine parts. When using an anti-seize product, though, you likely need to reduce the torque by up to 10% on each plug. Spark Plug Wires: You may be able to reuse your existing spark plug wires after replacing old, damaged or ineffective plugs. Still, your plug wires are essential components. If you notice signs of wear and tear or other damage, replacing spark plug wires when you add new spark plugs is a good idea. Distributor Cap: This part only applies to vehicles that have distributors. Just as spark plugs and wires can wear out over time, your vehicle\u2019s distributor cap may not last forever. After replacing spark plugs and wires, inspect the distributor cap for signs of damage. If you see any, opt for a new distributor cap.\n\nAchieving Success \n\nReplacing bad spark plugs is probably a project you can tackle on a weekend. Before you do, though, you must be sure you have the tools needed to change spark plugs. With a bit of planning and the correct tools, you can achieve success.  \nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Common Ignition Problems",
        "content": "Common Ignition Problems\n\n1. Faulty Ignition Coil, Spark Plug, or Spark Plug Wires\n\nAn ignition issue can be caused by a faulty or failing ignition coil, spark plug, or spark plug wire set. These critical components of your ignition system keep your engine running smoothly. If they have a problem, you\u2019ll notice a rough ride, engine misfires, and possibly decreased gas mileage, along with in most cars, a Check Engine Light (CEL) for a misfire.\nOften times, replacing the failed or failing part will correct this issue.\nIgnition coils and wire sets are fairly straightforward to replace. However, some applications will require removal of major components such as the upper intake plenum manifold. Reference a repair guide for more specific information for your vehicle. We highlight how to properly test your ignition coils, or troubleshoot problems here.\nSpark plugs may require a bit more attention on some vehicles. Some can be very easy to get to and replace, where other ones are a long, complex job depending on their location. We have a guide on replacing spark plugs. Some spark plugs need to be gapped and have anti-seize applied before installing and some do not. Check the spark plug manufacturer\u2019s requirements. \n\n2. Crank Position Sensor Failure\n\nAny modern ignition system that doesn\u2019t use a distributor has to have a method at which to determine the precise moment to fire the ignition coils. To do this, a crank position sensor is used, which is essentially a magnetic trigger. At the precise moment in revolution, the sensor picks up a trigger point in the rotating crank, and sends signal. When this sensor fails, this signal is lost. Sometimes, it the part fails completely and you have either a dead vehicle on the road, or a no-start situation. Other times, the problem can be intermittent, leading to misfires, or stalling issues. In most cases, when this occurs, the vehicles engine computer will pick up a code for crank position sensors.\n\n3. Cam Position Sensor\n\nLike it\u2019s cousin, the crank position sensor, a cam position sensor does the same thing on the engine\u2019s camshafts, or multiple camshafts. These devices read the position of the cam in respect to ignition timing, to either advance (make the spark come earlier) or retard (make the spark come later) in the stroke. \nWhen a cam position sensor goes awry, you can experience much of the same issues \u2013 misfires, lack of power, poor gas mileage, or a no-run / no-start situation. Like most sensors, it\u2019s also picked up by the vehicles engine computer, so if there\u2019s a fault, an engine code will pick it up.\n\n4. Distributor Pick-Up Coil / Hall Effect Sensor\n\nVery similar to a crank position sensor, in distributor-style ignition systems that do not use breaker points, each distributor has a pick-up coil, or hall effect sensor (same thing) that reads a cog wheel inside the distributor to accurately pick up and tell the precise moment when to send a signal to the coil to fire. \nWhen a pick up coil goes out, you generally have a no-start situation. Many people often think this is the ignition coil, but often times, the pick-up coil is the culprit. Changing these coils can be difficult, because often, the distributor must be completely removed to gain access to it.\n\n5. Ignition Module\n\nMany vehicles made in the last 10 years no longer use a proper Ignition Module, and instead house its function either in each individual coil, or in the vehicles onboard computer. Ignition Modules were the standard for many electronic ignition systems from the late 70\u2019s all the way through the early 2000\u2019s. Many foreign vehicles refer to the unit as a power output stage control, or ignition control unit, but they are all the same thing. \nThese devices help process the signal from a crank position sensor or pick-up coil in a distributor system and distribute the signal of when the coil should fire. When they go out, you can have a misfire, coil packs not functioning properly, or a no-run / no-start situation.\n\nPinpointing an issue\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, that there are a multitude of other sensors and situations on a vehicle not related to the above scenarios that can cause a misfire. Fueling, vacuum, engine timing \u2013 to name a few \u2013 can also cause issues that will need to be investigated. Remember on any of these components to always carefully inspect the electrical connectors and related wiring for shorts or potential problems before changing parts.

        "title": "What Kind of Spark Plugs Do I Need?",
        "content": "What are Spark Plugs\n\nDifferent Types of Spark Plugs\n\n1. Copper Spark Plugs\n\nCopper plugs have been around for over a century and have a solid copper core with a nickel alloy electrode. Nickel is softer than platinum or iridium, and thus has a much shorter life. These plugs are usually best for older, low-voltage systems. Because of copper\u2019s high conductivity, some high performance\u202fvehicles require them.\n\n2. Platinum Spark Plugs\n\nPlatinum plugs became popular in the late-80\u2019s, when ignition systems began to migrate from distributor-based systems, to coil pack or DIS (wasted spark) systems, which demanded a plug that could withstand the higher-energy, more demanding system. The harder, platinum material lasted longer, as manufacturers made a push to develop spark plugs and antifreeze that lasted upwards of 80-100K miles. Platinum plugs use a platinum disc that is welded to the end of the center electrode, which allows the plug to last longer than a copper plug, retaining its edge better, which means better conductivity. Platinum spark plugs tend to run hotter, preventing fouling and buildup of deposits. It\u2019s important to note that DIS \u201cwasted spark\u201d coil systems operate best on Double Platinum Plugs. Learn more about these related issues in our ignition systems article.\n\n3. Double Platinum Spark Plugs\n\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, DIS \u201cwasted spark\u201d ignition systems were created, which essentially means that one coil pack controls the firing of two spark plugs in the system. In doing this, both spark plugs that attach to that single coil pack spark at the exact same time \u2013 the difference is that one is firing on the compression stroke, and one is firing on the exhaust stroke of the sister-cylinder, which is referred to as a \u201cwasted spark\u201d. To make this even more complicated, one spark plug attached to each coil is positive polarity, while one is reverse polarity. This means that the spark on one plug travels from the center electrode to the side electrode. On the other plug, the spark travels from the side electrode to the center electrode. What this means is that instead of the center electrode wearing as it does in traditional ignition systems, now, the side electrode wears on the plug that is reversed-polarity! This created the need for a double-platinum plug that has a platinum disc on both the center electrode, and the side electrode. This created a plug that is very durable in DIS systems, lasting upwards of 80-100K miles. You don\u2019t want to install single platinum plugs if your owner\u2019s manual recommends a double platinum spark plug. Granted, the plug will work, but will wear prematurely and not perform as well.\n\n4. Iridium Spark Plugs\n\nHarder than platinum, Iridium plugs came on the market in the mid-2000\u2019s as coil-on-plug systems began to get more popular. Iridium plugs usually feature the smallest diameter center, which can increase efficiency by reducing voltage needed to create a spark. Iridium is also famous for continuing to fire under extreme conditions. If your manual specifies iridium spark plugs, best practice is to absorb the extra cost associated with this rarer metal for best performance.\n\n5. Double Iridium Spark Plugs\n\nLike double platinum spark plugs, double Iridium spark plugs feature two discs of rare metal for increased performance and durability. Double Iridium Spark Plugs are designed to deliver the firepower necessary under any driving conditions, especially extreme heat or continual high-speeds, and can provide up to 4 times the normal life of service compared to a standard copper spark plug.\n\nWhat Kind of Spark Plugs Do I Need?\n\nThe different types of spark plugs can seem overwhelming at first, but the simple way to find out what kind of spark plug you need is by checking your owner\u2019s manual. The manual will specify the right plugs for your vehicle. Another way to check is to enter your vehicle\u2019s information on AutoZone.com, or by checking with a parts specialist at your local AutoZone store.",

        "title": "What are Bad Spark Plug Symptoms?",
        "content": "Signs to Tell If Your Spark Plugs Need to Be Replaced\n\n1. Visual Inspection\n\nRemove and compare your old spark plugs to a new one. If the tip and/or electrode show excessive wear they should be replaced. Also, look for fuel and oil contamination. If contamination is found, the spark plugs should be replaced. However, additional inspection is needed to determine the cause of the contamination whether it is caused by oil, fuel, or coolant. Failing components within the engine itself can cause oil or coolant contamination. Fuel contamination can be caused by failing components within the fuel, ignition and/or emission systems.\nPro Tip: The following are symptoms that may occur with worn spark plugs. Keep in mind, there may be other issues causing the problem. Be sure and do a complete inspection before replacing any parts.\n\n2. Trouble Starting\n\nIf you are experiencing what seems to be longer cranking times, especially on a cold morning, you\u2019ll want to look at your spark plugs and related ignition and fuel system components. Over time, spark plugs develop residue from unburnt gases and oils, which reduces your car\u2019s performance and makes cold-starting more difficult. Tough cold starting is not only bad for your engine, but can also drain the battery and increase starter wear and tear.\n\n3. Rough Idling\n\nIf your vehicle\u2019s engine is running rough or noisy when idling, you likely have a problem in your ignition system. Heavy rumbling when waiting at a stoplight or in a drive-thru may indicate your car is overdue for maintenance. It may be a spark plug issue, but it could just as easily be another component like ignition coils causing the problem. Inspect the system and determine if the spark plugs or something like the ignition coils and wires need to be replaced. Make sure that you diagnose the issue before you go about replacing parts, otherwise you could end up wasting time and money.\n\n4. Misfiring\n\nMisfires are hard to miss, as the engine will shake so badly that you\u2019ll feel the vibration throughout the car. Misfiring results in poor performance, reduced fuel economy, increased emissions, and rough idling. Replacing spark plugs may help with this issue but, as above, inspect the system first.\n\n5. Decreased Fuel Mileage\n\nLow gas mileage is a subtler sign of worn spark plugs. Deteriorated spark plugs can account for as much as a 30-percent loss in fuel economy, which you\u2019ll definitely feel at the pump and your wallet. If you\u2019ve checked and determined the fuel mileage has dropped, check your spark plugs and related items for signs of wear.",

    {
        "title": "How to Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "HOW TO CHANGE SPARK PLUGS\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and ensure the engine is cool. Clean the engine area of any dirt and debris to prevent anything from falling into the engine cylinder during spark plug replacement. Additionally, you may want to disconnect the battery (negative post only). Check the vehicle repair guide or other resources to ensure no damage will occur if the battery is disconnected for any length of time or if any modules or other items would need to be reprogrammed. Ensure the positive and negative terminals do not become crossed with a foreign object such a hand ratchet and cause a dangerous short circuit.\n\n2. REMOVE THE SPARK PLUG WIRE\n\nFirst, remove any interference items. If your vehicle requires removal of the upper intake plenum, a new gasket will be needed. After gaining access, you will likely find the rubber spark plug wire end and inside metal terminal somewhat difficult to remove from the spark plug. You must be careful to avoid damaging the rubber boot or tearing the wire terminal away from the plug wire end. If you discover the plug wire boot is \u2018stuck\u2019 to the spark plug try using spark plug wire pliers to aid in removal. The boot may need to be twisted back and forth to break the bond from the spark plug. Again, be careful. The metal terminal that connects to the spark plug inside the boot must be removed simultaneously with the boot to avoid damage. If damage to the boot or wire occurs, don\u2019t feel bad. In many instances, even a professional is unable to remove them without damage occurring. If damage does occur, the wire(s) must be replaced. Re-installing a damaged boot or wire will cause a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the spark plug wires are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. A new plug wireset will ensure the newly installed spark plugs will receive all the necessary firepower from the ignition coil(s).\n\n3. REMOVE THE COIL ON PLUG (COP)\n\nCOP designed coils attach directly to the spark plug end and use a long rubber insulator boot. Start the removal process by disconnecting the electrical connector from the ignition coil. Press down or pull up on the locking tab to make the connector release so it can be disconnected. A small screwdriver may be needed to help depress the locking tab. Once the connector is off, remove the hold down bolt and carefully twist the coil about a quarter turn or so back and forth until the \u2018bond\u2019 is broken. Then it should pull straight up and out. Use caution! There is always a risk of damage to the COP boot. COP coils and their insulator boots are made of plastic and rubber that protect and insulate the high voltage conducting materials inside. Damage will cause the high voltage to leak (short) to ground causing a misfire and possible damage to other ignition components. If the boots are damaged they must be replaced. Just like spark plug wires, if they are five to seven years old or have 100K+ miles of use, replacement is highly recommended. Check the COP boots for signs of engine oil or engine anti-freeze contamination. Oil puddled in the spark plug well hole is usually caused by a valve cover tube seal and/or leaking O-ring. The appearance of coolant in the plug well can be caused by a leaking heater or by-pass hose or even the intake manifold gasket. These leaks should be repaired first, especially if severe, to prevent damage to the new components.\n\n4. UNSCREW THE SPARK PLUG\n\nBe sure the engine is cooled off. Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs. Avoid thread damage by following these suggested steps. On COP applications remove debris by blowing air down into the spark plug well hole. Even the tiniest of particles can build up in the threads of the spark plug during removal and cause damage to the cylinder head threads. If this occurs, sometimes a spark plug thread restorer tool may be used to do just that, restore damaged threads in the cylinder head. Next, loosen/turn the spark plug about a half a turn counter-clockwise and blast a small shot of penetrant fluid to the base/ thread area of the spark plug. Allow a few minutes to soak. On some engines, the manufacture may provide additional removal steps. Check the repair guide. Take note it you feel considerable resistance while turning the spark plug counter-clockwise. You may need an additional small amount of penetrant and soaking time. If you encounter resistance, turn the spark plug clockwise and carefully work it back and forth. If the plug just won\u2019t co-operate, you should probably stop and seek a professional\u2019s help. Damaged cylinder head threads can often be expensive to repair, depending on your vehicle.\n\n5. PUT IN THE NEW SPARK PLUGS\n\n6. RE-INSTALL THE SPARK PLUG WIRES OR IGNITION COILS (COP)\n\nApply a small amount of plug wire grease to the plug wire boot (or COP boot) and re-install each plug wire or ignition coil. Be sure and connect the plug wires to the appropriate spark plug for each engine cylinder (refer to a firing order diagram if necessary). Re-install the coil hold down bolt(s). Re-attach the electrical connector(s). Re-install all other components removed to gain access. Be sure and gather up all tools and the engine is free and clear to start. Remember to re-connect the battery if it was disconnected at the beginning.\n\n7. START UP THE ENGINE\n\nStarting the engine after the spark plug replacement is a good way to validate your work. Note: If your Check Engine Light is on, you can drive your vehicle to your local AutoZone store and have the code translated.

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Starter Solenoid",
        "content": "What is a Starter Solenoid?\n\nOn older cars with the starter solenoid mounted on the firewall rather than the starter motor itself, the solenoid is essentially a relay. When it receives a signal from the ignition switch, it closes the circuit and sends a powerful current to the starter motor so it can crank the engine over. However, this design is pretty rare these days.\nOn virtually all cars manufactured in the past 40 to 50 years, the starter solenoid is integrated onto the starter motor \u2013 it looks like a smaller cylinder on top of the starter assembly where the electrical connections attach. It also acts as a relay to close the circuit to the starter, but it does much more.\nWhen the solenoid gets an ignition signal, an electromagnet pulls a plunger back in the solenoid. That motion moves a shift lever that pushes the drive pinion on the starter motor outward so that the pinion gear is inline with the flywheel\u2019s ring gear.\nMeanwhile, the powerful current from the battery bridges from the solenoid to the starter motor and causes the electric motor to rotate, spinning the engine over.\nWhen the ignition is released, power is immediately disconnected at the solenoid. The starter stops spinning under power and freewheels to a stop while the solenoid plunger moves back to its resting position, letting the pinion gear release from the ring gear.\n\nCauses of a Bad Starter Solenoid\n\nOver time and with use, bad starter solenoid symptoms can develop. It can occur from a few different origins, and some are much more prevalent than others. Causes include:\n\nCorrosion. It can occur around the terminals due to moisture and oxidation, creating poor electrical contact and preventing the starter motor from engaging.\nBroken connections. Another common cause of bad starter solenoids is a loose or damaged connection. Over time, internal connections can come apart because of vibrations while driving or extreme temperatures.\nWear and tear. Some starter solenoids simply become too old or worn out due to daily use over many years and need to be replaced in order for the car to start properly.\n\nSigns of a Bad Starter Solenoid\n\nWhen a starter solenoid isn\u2019t working as it should, you\u2019ll encounter symptoms that point you to it. One of the first and most common symptoms is simply no response from the starter when you turn the key \u2013 no noises or engine cranking at all. Sometimes, repeatedly trying the ignition can produce a result, but that\u2019s not guaranteed. It usually means there\u2019s a faulty connection in the solenoid.\nAnother common symptom is a single clicking noise when you turn the key. It indicates that the solenoid is receiving the ignition signal but there\u2019s an internal connection issue or binding that\u2019s preventing the starter from engaging.\nGrinding noises are a common occurrence for a bad starter solenoid. The starter is cranking over but the solenoid isn\u2019t pulling the shift lever back properly to engage the pinion gear with the flywheel, and the gears are grinding against each other.\nFinally, it\u2019s possible for the starter to remain engaged after the ignition input has stopped. A short inside the solenoid causes power to constantly bridge to the starter when the ignition is in the on position.\n\nPreventing Starter Solenoid Problems\n\nThe starter motor and its solenoid are installed in an area that\u2019s rather inhospitable with high heat and environmental elements constantly bombarding it. There\u2019s not much that can be done to protect the starter solenoid from exposure, but there are ways to prevent abnormal wear or corrosion.\nYou should keep the solenoid terminals free of dirt and debris, as this can cause corrosion and lead to failure. It\u2019s also important to check the wiring between the ignition switch and the starter motor to make sure that there are no loose connections, which can cause too much current to be sent to the solenoid. Following these steps can help extend the life of the starter solenoid and avoid costly repairs in the future.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Starter Solenoid",
        "content": "When to Replace a Starter Solenoid\n\nThe symptoms for a bad starter solenoid are pretty evident since it almost always prevents your engine from starting at all. If you hear a clicking noise when you turn the ignition key but the engine doesn\u2019t crank, there\u2019s plenty of battery power but there\u2019s no cranking or clicking noises when you hit the ignition, or the starter keeps cranking after you stop turning the key, it could very well be a bad starter solenoid.\nIt could also be a faulty starter motor itself, though, so it\u2019s critical to verify the problem. Manually check that the starter is getting power when you turn the key by verifying there\u2019s 12-volt power at the solenoid, then cranking the engine over while checking for voltage out of the solenoid to the starter. If there\u2019s low or no voltage present when cranking, the solenoid is likely bad.\n\nSafety Precautions\n\nWhen you\u2019re changing the starter solenoid, safety is paramount. Begin by disconnecting the battery\u2019s negative cable to prevent a short, and always wear gloves and eye protection. Work in a clean area free of any combustible items since a small spark could ignite it.\n\nTools and Parts Required\n\nTo replace a starter solenoid, you\u2019ll need a few supplies on hand to make it go smoothly. You\u2019ll require:\n\nCar ramps or a floor jack and axle stands\nWrench set\nRatchet and socket set\nImpact wrench\nScrewdriver set\nEye and hand protection\nTorque wrench\n\nHow to Replace a Starter Solenoid\n\n1. Locating the Starter Solenoid\n\nFor modern vehicles, the starter solenoid is attached to the starter motor itself. You\u2019ll often find it mounted under the vehicle at the bell housing \u2013 where the engine and transmission are joined. Identify it by the thick battery cable that\u2019s fastened to it along with a thinner switch wire.\nOn older vehicles like classic cars, it\u2019s common for the starter solenoid to be mounted on the firewall, usually higher up near the hood.\n\n2. Removing the Old Starter Solenoid\n\nTo remove the failed part on cars from the 80s until now, changing the starter solenoid requires removing the starter motor itself. Begin by parking your vehicle on ramps so you can see and work underneath, or lift and secure it with a floor jack and axle stands. Then, disconnect the battery.\nUse the appropriate wrenches to loosen and remove the nuts from the studs on the solenoid. Move and secure the wires to the side, then unbolt the starter motor from its location. An impact wrench and extensions are helpful here. Once it\u2019s free, bring it to your workbench.\nIf you have a car with a firewall-mounted starter solenoid, it\u2019s simpler. After disconnecting the battery, simply undo the wiring connections and unscrew it from the firewall.\n\n3. Installing the New Starter Solenoid\n\nFor newer cars, the solenoid often is integrated with the starter motor and can\u2019t be replaced separately. In this instance, purchase a new starter and install it in the reverse order. Be sure to torque the wiring connections and the mounting bolts.\nFor firewall-mounted solenoids, simply ensure you have the same solenoid, then screw it into place on the firewall. Attach the wiring connectors to the same locations as the old part.\nThen, reconnect the battery and lower your car.\n\n4. Testing the Starter Solenoid\n\nThe easiest way to test the starter solenoid is to crank the engine over. If it starts, you\u2019ve discovered and corrected the issue successfully. If it still isn\u2019t starting, re-test for voltage at the starter motor. If it still isn\u2019t present, there\u2019s something else wrong with the ignition system.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nOne of the most common problems that DIYers have with a starter solenoid replacement is installing the wiring wrong. Crossing wires can and will result in sparks, blown fuses or relays, or even a short that can damage the battery or start a fire.\nTo prevent this issue, take a snapshot of the wiring connections before removing your old solenoid as a reference when you put it back together.",

        "title": "Remote Starter Buying Guide",
        "content": "Types of Remote Starters\n\nThere are three types of systems available to start your car remotely: one-way, two-way, and smartphone-compatible starters.\n\nA one-way starter communicates in one direction between the remote and the vehicle, and it\u2019s by far the most common type. When you press the button or sequence to start your vehicle, it sends a signal to the vehicle. If the car is within range, it starts and flashes the lights marker lights to indicate it\u2019s running. But no signal is sent back to the remote, so unless you have line of sight with your car, you don\u2019t know that it\u2019s running.\nA two-way remote starter communicates with the vehicle via a remote also, but once the engine starts, a signal is sent back to the remote to indicate that it\u2019s going. Two-way remotes either have an LED light or an LCD screen to indicate the vehicle\u2019s status, so you don\u2019t need to be able to see your vehicle to confirm that it\u2019s running.\nSmartphone starting functionality is essentially a different type of two-way remote starter that uses cellular rather than radio frequency to communicate. As long as your vehicle and your device have a cell signal, you can fire up the engine from wherever you are.\n\nFeatures of Remote Starters\n\nOf course, the main benefit or feature of a remote start system is the ability to pre-condition the interior temperature by starting the engine remotely, hence the name. But there are other features available.\nMany, if not all, remote start systems are capable of integrating with your power door locks. If you didn\u2019t previously have remote keyless entry but you have power locks, it\u2019s a great option to enable that feature.\nSome systems can act as a turbo timer also, letting you leave your vehicle running unattended without keys in it to let it cool down.\nAlso, some systems are compatible with an alarm, especially two-way systems. By wiring in a few extra circuits, a siren, and sensors, you can better protect your vehicle from theft or damage.\nAnd for cellular-enabled systems, advanced controls can be put in place such as geo-fencing, speed limiters, ignition lockout, and vehicle location services.\n\nConsiderations when Purchasing a Remote Starter\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a remote starter, the system you choose will be priced according to its capabilities and features, and there are several you should consider.\n\nRange is a major factor. Some factory remote starters and entry-level systems are limited to around 50 feet or so. Good-quality aftermarket remote starters stretch that to 1,000 feet, while FM-frequency remote starters can go up to 2,500 feet \u2013 sometimes more. Cell-enabled smartphone remote car starters have an unlimited range, as long as there\u2019s signal.\nEase of install is also a consideration. Some systems are complicated to wire in while others are designed almost as easy as plug and play. However, if your vehicle has an immobilizer or chipped key, it gets more complex and it\u2019s probably best left for a pro.\nKey fobs. If there\u2019s more than one driver, you might want to add more fobs. However, some systems are limited to what comes in the kit while others can be expanded. Also, two-way fobs are costly to replace if they\u2019re lost or damaged.\nCompatibility. Although most remote start kits are \u2018universal\u2019, some may need additional parts to function with manual transmission vehicles or other model-specific functions.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Starter Replacement Cost",
        "content": "How Much a\u00a0Starter Replacement Costs\n\nThe cost of rebuild parts for a starter can range from as little as $50 to as much as $350. A brand-new starter can range from $80 to over $350. For a qualified mechanic to replace or rebuild your starter, you can expect to pay between $150 and over $1,100. These estimates vary dramatically depending on the particular issue and the make, model, and year of your vehicle. Many vehicles have a starter that is easily accessible and can be removed and replaced in under an hour \u2013 others are far more complicated, as they can be housed other engine components \u2013 like underneath the intake manifold.\n\nFactors That Affect the\u00a0Replacement Cost\n\nThe first thing you need to do is determine whether your vehicle\u2019s starting issue is truly caused by a starter. Because of the interrelated nature of many starting system components, your issue may be a number of electrical or mechanical issues outside of the starter. An old battery could also show the same\u00a0symptoms. If your vehicle has a starter fuse and/or relay, start by looking at one of those.\nDetermining the exact part that\u2019s damaged can help you or a mechanic compare the cost of rebuilding or replacing your starter. Either way, the starter needs to be removed completely from your engine compartment. A rebuild project can take a significant amount of time, but a replacement project only requires a new starter to be replaced and the bolts tightened to OEM torque specifications.\nWhat are the\u00a0Signs You Need a New Starter\n\nA starter is critical to the basic operation of your\u202fengine starting system, so many issues with starting your vehicle can be signs that you need a new automotive starter. Here are a few common signs that your starter is damaged:\n\nErratic cranking of your vehicle\nNo response when you turn the key\nUnusual noises when you start your vehicle\n\nYou want to learn all the signs and symptoms of a bad starter.\nThe armature of the\u202fstarter\u202fneeds to be free from damage in order to work efficiently. Minor defects with this component can create unusual starting issues. If there are electrical or mechanical faults inside your starter, it may turn too slowly to reach the ideal cranking RPM of your engine. You may hear the engine turn over, but the process is too slow to fully start your engine.\nOdd sounds, particularly grinding, could reflect a\u202fflywheel ring\u00a0or starter drive gear failure. These internal components need to be repaired or replaced to restore your starting system. Finally, some internal starter issues can cause your starter to fail completely. If this is the case, turning the key in your ignition won\u2019t produce any sounds or other signs of starting your engine.\n\nWhat are the\u00a0Parts of a Starter\n\nstarter is made up of several basic parts. Understanding the internal components of a starter can help you find out whether to repair or\u202freplace your starter, which can affect the price of this service. Here are the main parts of an automotive starter:\n\nElectromagnetic field coils or permanent magnets\nArmature and commutator\nSolenoid\nShift fork\nStarter drive gear\nBrushes\nBearings and bushings\n\nThe electromagnetic field coils are housed in the starter housing. Depending on your vehicle, you may have between two and four field coils. These are energized by your automotive battery and power the armature to turn over the engine. The armature is a durable component mounted on a shaft and bearings. The armature is wrapped with conductor loops to transfer voltage and retain electrical contact as the armature rotates.\nA\u00a0starter\u2019s solenoid\u00a0is made up of a movable core and two coils of wire. It switches on and off to control the electrical circuit and activate the starter. On starters that have an integrated solenoid, a plunger attached to the solenoid manipulates the shift fork, which is connected to the starter drive gear to turn the engine over when engaged.\nStarters come in a wide range of sizes and designs. Not all starters operate exactly the same way, and the location of your starter can vary. Always consult your owner\u2019s manual before purchasing a starter or\u00a0starter rebuild kit.\n\nCan I Drive with a\u00a0Faulty Starter?\n\nAs the name implies, a starter only operates while you\u2019re starting your engine. Once the engine is running, a starter isn\u2019t necessary for continued operation. However, it\u2019s essential to order a new starter or have a mechanic inspect your starter issue promptly. Once you turn off your engine, a faulty starter may prevent you from continuing to operate your vehicle.\n\nDo I Need to\u00a0Repair or Replace\u00a0My Starter?\n\nCheck with a mechanic or carefully inspect the entire starting system to determine whether your starter is causing the issue. If it is, you\u2019ll need to inspect your starter to identify the source of the issue. Some damaged starter components are straightforward to rebuild, while others require significant components and time. For major rebuild projects, it may be more cost-effective to replace your starter completely. This will save a significant amount of time whether you are replacing your own starter or working with a professional mechanic.\n\nFind Affordable Starters\u00a0Today\n\nShop online or at your\u00a0local AutoZone auto parts store\u00a0for great deals on name-brand starters. Now that you have an estimate on how much to replace a starter, sort starters based on your make and model of vehicle to determine the exact cost of this essential repair project.

        "title": "Signs of a Bad Starter - How to Identify Your Starter is Failing",
        "content": "What is a Starter?\n\nTo keep the explanation simple, a starter is essentially a small electrical motor. This motor is powered by the car battery. The one job of this motor is to help get your car up and running. The starter motor is one piece of the starting system in your vehicle. Other pieces or\u00a0parts of the starting system\u00a0include the battery, battery cables, a starter relay, connecting wiring, ignition switch, Transmission Gear Position switch, Clutch Interlock switch (manual transmissions) and in some cases the engine computer. If any of these parts of your starting system are malfunctioning your car won\u2019t start and you won\u2019t be able to get it moving without a tow truck.\n\nBad Starter Symptoms\n\nsigns on when to replace your starter\n\nOf course, there are multiple reasons why your car may not start, and the starter is just one of those potential reasons. Here are some common bad starter symptoms:\n\n1. DASH LIGHTS\n\nThe\u00a0dashboard warning lights\u00a0come on when you try to turn on your car, but the engine does not crank or spin over. This is a classic sign of a bad starter.\n\n2. CLICKING\n\nIf you experience the dreaded \u201cclicking\u201d noise when you try to turn the key, this is a good sign of starter failure. Keep in mind though that even if you do not get the clicking noise and nothing happens when you try to start the car, the issue may still be with the starter.\n\n3. SLOW CRANKING\n\nAnother symptom of a failing starter is an engine that cranks over very slowly, the starter seems to drag or struggle to spin the engine over.\n\n4. SMOKE\n\nSince there are so many electrical components connected to the starter system, if you try to turn on the car and the only result of this is a ton of smoke, you definitely need to put the key down and call a mechanic. This could be a sign of the starter causing the electrical system to overheat.\n\n5. OIL-SOAKED STARTER\n\nYou may also want to take the time to pop open the hood and see if you can locate the starter. Sometimes, the oil system can spring a leak which soaks the starter, leading the starter to malfunction. If this is the case, you may be in for some very expensive repairs. You will likely need to replace the starter, but you will also need to repair the oil leaks to prevent premature failure of your replacement starter.\n\nIf nothing gets your engine started, even a jump start, it is likely that the problem is with your starter. If this is the case, you likely need to go ahead and call a tow truck to get your car to a mechanic, unless you\u2019re comfortable\u00a0replacing your own starter.\n\nStarter Parts\n\nSelect the parts you need, and enter your vehicle\u2019s year, make, model, and engine to find the part that fits.\n\nHow to Start a Car with a Bad Starter\n\nThe reality is that you may not actually be able to start the car at all, depending on the nature of the problem. However, if you suspect that you have a bad starter, the first thing to do is try to\u00a0jump start the car.\nIn order to jump start the car, you need to ensure that both batteries are in good condition (so no leaks and no corrosion) and ensure that anything electronic in both cars is completely turned off. You also need to have a\u00a0set of jumper cables\u00a0and some gloves to protect your hands while you are connecting the batteries together.\nOnce this is done, you can connect the battery in your car to the battery in the functioning car. There should be red cables and black cables marked clearly on the jumper cables. Place the red cables on the positive terminals and the black cables on the negative ones. Make sure that you double check that you have connected the correct jumper cable to the correct battery terminal. Failure to do so can cause very expensive problems in both cars!\nWhen you have ensured that everything is connected correctly, go ahead and start the working car. This causes the non-functioning car to borrow energy from the functioning one. You want to keep the functioning car on for a few minutes so that the non-functioning car has time to borrow the energy.\nOnce this is done, you may be able to start your car.\nIf you are not able to start the car with a jump start, you may want to consider checking the following:\n\nLook at the battery of the car. It is possible that a dead or weak battery is causing your car not to start, rather than a problem with the starter system. A voltmeter can help you check this.\nCarefully inspect the battery cables and connections. The battery cables and connections need to be clean and tight, there should not be any rust or corrosion on the battery cables and all of the connections at the battery and the starter should be tight and secure.\n\nHowever, if you use any of these methods to start the car, it is important to get ready for some DIY repairs or take the car to a mechanic as soon as possible. A starter that is struggling now will fail soon after.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "What is the Starting and Charging System?",
        "content": "How Vehicle Starting and Charging Works\n\n1. The battery supplies power to your vehicle\n\nThe starting battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The three essential parts for this conversion are the anode, the cathode, and the electrolyte.\n\nThe anode is the negatively-charged side of the battery\nThe cathode is the positively-charged side\nThe electrolyte is a buffer that separates the anode and cathode\n\nChemical reactions inside of the battery cause electrons to build up in the anode. Like with magnets, the similarly charged particles repel one another, but in a battery the electrolyte blocks these particles from merely switching sides by moving over to the opposite side.\n\n2. Battery cables and terminals carry current from the battery\n\nBattery cables connect the battery\u2019s terminals to the vehicle. One end of each cable is connected to either the negative or positive terminal.\n\nThe other end of the negative cable is often connected to the engine or somewhere on the vehicle\u2019s frame\nThe positive cable\u2019s other end is typically connected to the starter or a fuse box\n\nBecause the electrolyte keeps the charged particles from crossing the battery, electrical current moves from the battery, through the cables, and into the vehicle.\nCorrosion and loose connections can keep your cables from working the way they should. Be sure to inspect your cables for looseness or corrosion from time to time. If you have a problem, it\u2019s easy to tighten the cables or to remove corrosion with a wire brush.\n\n3. Relays, fuses, and the starter receive electrical current\n\nThe moment you turn the key to start in your car (or push the button) a signal is sent to a relay, or series of relays. The main relay in this group is referred to as the starter solenoid. The signal, coming from the ignition, is low amperage. When it hits these relays, and the starter solenoid, this engages a high-amperage current which directly engages the starter.\nYour vehicle\u2019s relays and fuses regulate current in the electrical systems.\n\nA relay is basically a switch that allows small currents to control accessories that would require heavy switches and wiring. Relays reduce the amount of wiring needed by having larger contact areas that can handle large amounts of current. The starter solenoid is generally one of the largest relays in your car because it handles such a huge amperage amount.\nMany vehicles have fuses in-line in their ignition system as well or a main battery or system fuse. These are often seen mounted either directly on the battery cable, or nearby in the engine\u2019s fuse/relay compartment.\nFuses protect your vehicle\u2019s electronic devices and wiring. If something like, say, your radio tries to draw too much current, the radio\u2019s fuse will blow, cutting off the current\u2019s path to the radio. This prevents the excess current from damaging the radio or melting wires in the system.\n\nAfter reaching the relays and fuses, current continues to the vehicle\u2019s various electrical systems.\n\n4. The starter turns the engine\n\nWhen the starter solenoid engages, the starter\u2019s gear, or \u201cbendix\u201d moves out to engage the flywheel or flexplate of the engine, turning it over. The turning of the engine allows the fuel air-mixture to enter into the engine cylinders for combustion, starting the engine.\nA clicking noise when you turn the key is a good indicator of low battery voltage that is sufficient enough to engage the relays, but not enough to turn the motor. Often times, you will hear a buzzing sound. This sound is your starter solenoid not fully engaging because of low or insufficient voltage. Or, in some cases, a click indicates that your starter has gone bad. In these cases, a visual inspection and/or removal and bench testing is needed, which AutoZone provides. If the starter is soaked with oil contamination and requires replacement, be sure the oil leak is repaired to prevent damage to the replacement starter.\n\n5. The accessory belt or serpentine belt drives the alternator\n\nOnce the engine is turning, rotational force from the crankshaft turns the belt pulley. The belt transfers this rotational force to other systems, like the power steering pump, the water pump, and most importantly for this article: the alternator.\n\n6. The alternator recharges the battery\n\nThe alternator is responsible for 2 things at the same time. It supplies voltage power to everything your car uses while it is running. While doing this, it also sends charge to the battery to maintain its charge as well, and in doing so, the battery acts as a capacitor. An alternator works no different than a windmill or turbine, generating AC power, which is then converted to DC power inside the alternator. The 3 items responsible for this inside the alternator are the rotor, stator, and rectifier. The alternator works similarly, except it is turned by the belt rather than a hand or the wind. The two components responsible for generating electricity are the rotor and the stator:\n\nThe rotor features magnetized finger poles that rotate surrounding the wire field winding. Each finger pole is a different length to produce alternating north and south poles for the winding.\nThe stator is just enough larger that the rotor can spin without touching the stator walls.\nA rectifier is in a sense a valve. It converts AC power (Alternating Current) into DC power (direct current).\n\nThe spinning magnetized poles generate current in the winding, and this current provides the power that charges your battery. Inside your alternator, a voltage regulator makes sure that this voltage is maintained at a proper level for your car\u2019s electrical system. This is usually somewhere between 14-16 volts.\nTest your alternator using an alternator/battery tester or voltmeter (Learn how to test an alternator here). Ensure the drive belt is in good condition and does not slip on the alternator pulley. A dead battery, one that won\u2019t stay charged, or headlamps and interior lights that appear dim can indicate that your alternator is possibly bad. Visually inspect your alternator for signs of the problem. If the alternator is replaced, be sure the battery is fully charged before starting the engine. This will prevent overload and potential damage to the replacement alternator. If the drive belt shows signs of wear, replace it to ensure the alternator will perform properly. If equipped with an automatic belt tensioner, inspect it for wear and binding/sticking. If it does not move smoothly it should be replaced along with the belt.\n\nRemember that AutoZone can help with any of your Battery, Alternator, or charging system needs through replacement parts or testing. If you need additional help, browse through our\u00a0Preferred Shops in your local area\u00a0to help you diagnose and do the job!\n\nOther Parts\u00a0You Can Check:\n\nFuses and fusible links\u00a0protect the circuits in the charging system. A fusible link is a fuse imbedded in a wire.\n\nInspect fuses for breaks or gaps in the wire filament\nTest fusible links using a voltmeter\n\nDashboard warning lights, gauges and LED readouts can provide clues to the source of your problem\n\nMake sure warning lights go off after your car has started\nMake sure the voltage gauge shows a reading of 12 volts when the car is off and rises to 14 volts after it\u2019s started\nPay attention to your Check Engine Light or Message Center Light; They can also indicate a problem\n\nIf you\u2019re working on the system, stop by AutoZone for\u00a0free battery, starter, or alternator testing.*\n*Battery test and charge available only in-store in California.

        "title": "Signs Of a Failing Rack and Pinion",
        "content": "Understanding the Rack and Pinion System\n\nThe rack and pinion system is a crucial component of your vehicle\u2019s steering mechanism, playing a pivotal role in ensuring smooth and responsive handling. This system is commonly found in most modern vehicles and consists of a rack which is a long, flat metal assembly, and a pinion which is a small gear that travels on it. The rack and pinion work together to convert the rotational motion of the steering wheel into linear motion, allowing you to control the direction of your vehicle with ease.\nThe rack and pinion system is responsible for translating the driver\u2019s input from the steering wheel into the movement of the vehicle\u2019s front wheels. Turning the steering wheel causes the pinion gear to rotate in place, and the rack inside the steering gear assembly is pushed to one side or the other. The rack ends attach to tie rods that, in turn, connect to the wheels, forcing them to pivot inward or outward.\nThis direct and efficient mechanism is one of the reasons why modern cars have precise and responsive steering. When the rack and pinion system is functioning correctly, you can enjoy a smooth and controlled driving experience.\n\nCommon Signs of Rack and Pinion Failure\n\nOne of the earliest indicators of a failing rack and pinion system is the presence of unusual noises during steering. Listen for clunking, knocking, or creaking sounds, especially when turning the wheel. These noises may suggest issues with the gears, bushings, or other internal components of the rack and pinion system.\nIf you notice excessive play in the steering wheel or experience difficulty turning it, these are clear signs of a potential problem with the rack and pinion. Play refers to the movement of the steering wheel without a corresponding movement in the vehicle\u2019s direction. Difficulty turning the wheel may indicate increased friction within the system or a lack of proper lubrication, or lack of power steering assist.\nFluid leaks, particularly power steering fluid, are critical indicators of rack and pinion issues. Check for puddles or spots of reddish or brown fluid under your vehicle, especially around the front wheels. Power steering fluid is essential for the smooth operation of the rack and pinion system, and any leaks can lead to decreased performance and potential failure.\n\nEffects on Vehicle Performance\n\nA failing rack and pinion system can significantly impact your vehicle\u2019s overall handling. You may notice increased difficulty in maintaining a straight line, a tendency to drift, or uneven tire wear. These issues can compromise your stability and make it more challenging to navigate turns and curves safely.\nDriving with a compromised rack and pinion system poses serious risks to your safety. Not only could you potentially lose control over your vehicle, but a problem can also lead to sudden and unexpected steering failures, increasing the likelihood of accidents. Recognizing and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to maintaining a safe driving experience.\n\nDiagnosing Rack and Pinion Issues\n\nBefore seeking professional help, there are a few simple checks you can perform to assess the condition of your rack and pinion system:\n\nStart by inspecting the power steering fluid level and color. Low or dirty fluid can indicate a problem.\nNext, visually inspect the system for leaks and listen for any unusual noises while turning the steering wheel.\nTest drive your vehicle. If you have a \u2019dead spot\u2019 when you turn the steering wheel where there\u2019s lack of assist or there\u2019s a loud whine, the rack may be the issue.\nFeel the steering wheel. Sometimes, a vibration or drone can be felt in the steering wheel that indicates a problem in the rack.\n\nDIY checks can provide initial insights, and a thorough diagnosis at home involves ruling out other potential issues to settle on a bad rack and pinion. The exception is when you see an obvious leak. If you\u2019re not comfortable with doing it yourself, you may want to bring it to a trusted mechanic.\nProfessional technicians have the expertise and tools to conduct a thorough assessment, identify specific issues, and recommend appropriate solutions.\n\nPreventative Maintenance Tips\n\nIncorporating regular inspection routines into your vehicle maintenance schedule can help prevent rack and pinion issues.\n\nPay attention to any changes in steering responsiveness, unusual noises, or fluid leaks. Early detection can save you from more extensive and costly repairs down the road.\nRegularly check the power steering fluid level and quality. If you notice it\u2019s low or if the fluid appears dirty, flush it.\nAvoid putting unnecessary strain on the steering components like oversized wheels or driving with a bad alignment.\nAvoid potholes and rough terrain when possible, as these can accelerate wear and tear.\n\nAdditionally, be mindful of overloading your vehicle, as excess weight can contribute to premature failure of the rack and pinion system.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "content": "Identifying a Bad Control Arm\n\nA bad control arm can affect the handling, stability, and overall safety of your vehicle. Identifying a bad control arm helps you address any issues and prevent further damage. Here are some common signs that indicate a failing control arm:\n\nUnusual noises \u2013 Clunking, creaking, or popping sounds coming from the suspension when going over bumps, turning, or braking may indicate worn or damaged control arm bushings or ball joints.\nUneven tire wear \u2013 A bad control arm can cause poor wheel alignment, leading to uneven or accelerated tire wear, particularly on the inner or outer edges of the tires.\nVibrations \u2013 If you feel vibrations in the steering wheel especially at higher speeds, it could be due to play that allows side-to-side motion at the wheel.\nPoor handling \u2013 A bad control arm can result in imprecise steering, excessive body roll during cornering, or a general feeling of instability while driving.\nVisible damage or wear \u2013 Inspect the control arm for visible signs of damage, such as cracks, bends, or corrosion. Check the bushings for excessive wear, cracking, or separation from the control arm. Look for worn or damaged ball joints, which may have torn rubber boots or visible rust.\nExcessive play \u2013 With the vehicle safely lifted and supported, grasp the wheel at the top and bottom and attempt to rock it back and forth. Excessive play could indicate a worn ball joint or bushing in the control arm.\n\nIf you find you have a bad control arm, changing it in a timely fashion can save hassle and money on additional repairs, plus it restores your vehicle\u2019s handling and safety.\n\nPreparing for Replacement\n\nWhether it\u2019s an upper or lower control arm you need to change, preparing to do the job requires the same precautions. Gather the tools you can foreseeably need such as a hydraulic jack and axle stand, a lug nut wrench, socket set, pliers, a breaker bar, a torque wrench, and a ball joint separator.\nYour car needs to be parked on a flat, level surface with the parking brake engaged, and the wheel should be pointed straight ahead. Then, make your job easier later on by loosening \u2013 but not removing \u2013 the lug nuts. Then, lift your car and set it down on jack stands. Once it\u2019s in the air, remove the wheel.\nFor an extra boost in confidence, get familiar with the process by researching online resources or checking ALLDATA for the exact procedure.\n\nReplacing the Control Arm (Upper and Lower)\n\nWith your vehicle prepped and the wheels off, you can get started on replacing a lower or upper control arm.\n\n1. Remove any obstructing components\n\nDepending on your vehicle, you may need to remove additional components such as a sway bar, brake caliper, or other suspension parts to access the control arm. Consult your repair manual for specific instructions on removing these components if necessary.\n\n2. Detach the ball joint\n\nUsing a ball joint separator or pickle fork, carefully separate the ball joint from the steering knuckle. You may need to remove a cotter pin and castle nut before using the separator.\n\n3. Remove the control arm bolts\n\nLocate the bolts that attach the control arm to the vehicle\u2019s frame or subframe. Use a socket wrench or breaker bar to remove these bolts. They may be seized, which might require penetrating oil, a hammer and punch, and some brute force to remove.\n\n4. Remove the old control arm\n\nOnce the bolts are removed, gently pry the control arm away from the vehicle and remove it completely. Be careful not to damage any surrounding components during this process.\n\n5. Inspect and clean the mounting points\n\nThoroughly inspect the mounting points on the vehicle for any signs of damage or excessive wear. Clean the area to remove any debris or rust.\n\n6. Install the new control arm\n\nPosition the new control arm in place, insert the bolts, and hand-tighten them initially. Then, using a torque wrench, tighten the control arm bolts to the manufacturer\u2019s specified torque setting.\n\n7. Reattach the ball joint\n\nAlign the ball joint with the steering knuckle and insert it back into place. Secure it with the castle nut and cotter pin, if your car uses them. Torque the castle nut to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\n\n8. Reinstall any removed components\n\nReinstall any components that were removed earlier, such as the sway bar, brake caliper, or other suspension parts. Ensure all fasteners are tightened to their correct torque specifications.\nOnce a control arm is replaced, it\u2019s recommended to get a wheel alignment performed, or at the very least, have a shop check that it\u2019s still within spec.\n\nTesting the New Control Arm\n\nAfter your control arm replacement is complete you need to verify that your symptoms are gone. Check that there\u2019s no longer play at the wheel when you shake it vertically, then take a test drive. Listen for rattling, clunking, or banging noises as you go over bumps, and feel for a vibration when you\u2019re driving at higher speeds. If you still have symptoms, there may be additional steering or suspension parts that need to be replaced, or you may have a fastener like a control arm bolt that\u2019s not quite tight.",

        "title": "Symptoms of a Bad Ball Joint",
        "content": "Function of a Ball Joint\n\nEvery vehicle has ball joints as part of its front steering and suspension system. It connects the control arm to the steering knuckle, allowing for up-and-down movement as well as side-to-side movement so that the wheels can turn correctly. The ball joint also helps to absorb road shock while driving, providing a smoother ride experience.\nEach ball joint has a ball and socket design, and a threaded stud fits into the steering knuckle. The socket is filled with grease to prevent wear, and it\u2019s covered with a boot to keep dirt and debris out.\nFor vehicles with a MacPherson strut-style suspension, there\u2019s only a lower ball joint since the strut is fastened to the upper section of the knuckle. For other suspension types, there\u2019s both a lower and an upper ball joint that helps keep the wheel positioned vertically as the suspension travels or the wheel turns.\n\nSigns of a Bad Ball Joint\n\nBall joints are known to wear out, although it\u2019s usually over the course of 70,000 miles or more. Sometimes it\u2019s even twice that long. But when there\u2019s a problem with a ball joint, you\u2019ll see signs well before it completely fails and separates.\n\nClunking Noises. When a ball joint is slightly loose, an occasional clunking noise can happen when you\u2019re driving over uneven surfaces or while turning. As it gets more play, the noise will amplify and happen much more often, turning into a hammering sound.\nSteering Wander. When ball joints are loose, your wheels can move side to side slightly, causing the feeling of wandering. Steering response is less precise.\nUneven Tire Wear. Your tires are indicators of steering and suspension play, and if you notice that the inner or outer shoulders have more wear than the rest of the tire, it could be an alignment issue due to bad ball joints.\nVibration. Loose ball joints can allow side-to-side movement, and at speed, it feels like an oscillation in the steering wheel.\nSteering Difficulty. At times, a loose ball joint can allow the front wheels to toe in, increasing the steering effort.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is a ball joint that separates. If that happens, your vehicle becomes undrivable and you can get into an accident when the wheel no longer is held in the position it should be, awkwardly pointing in the wrong direction.\n\nCauses of a Bad Ball Joint\n\nAlthough ball joint or control arm replacement is inevitable, there are some common causes.\n\nExcessive Wear. Over time, ball joints can wear down due to frequent use and friction. This can cause the joint to become loose, leading to metal-on-metal contact in the socket which eventually causes it to fail.\nLack of Lubrication. Ball joints require lubrication in order to stay in good working condition and prevent excessive wear. If they are not properly lubricated, they can suffer from premature wear and tear.\nDamaged Components. If any of the components that make up the ball joint are damaged or broken, it can lead to a bad ball joint. This could be anything from a bent control arm or damaged suspension bushings.\nRust or Corrosion. Any rust or corrosion that gets into the socket, like if the boot is torn and the grease has leaked out, can contribute to failure.\n\nHow to Test for a Bad Ball Joint\n\nSome aftermarket ball joints are equipped with wear indicators, but that\u2019s not usually the case for original equipment parts. Diagnosing a loose ball joint or control arm before it completely separates is crucial for safety, but you need to know how to tell if a ball joint is bad.\nThe first step is to take a look at the ball joint itself. Look for any signs of wear or damage such as cracks or cuts in the dust boot, rust, or evidence of cracks.\nNext, inspect for any excessive play in the joint itself by moving the wheel vertically and both feeling and listening for a cluck. If there is more than one inch of play in either direction, then it\u2019s likely that your ball joint needs to be replaced soon.\nFor some vehicles with upper and lower ball joints, you need to support the vehicle\u2019s weight on a jack stand to check for play, relieving the tension on the joint to accurately diagnose it. On others, some play \u2013 sometimes more than a quarter-inch of play \u2013 is allowable and considered normal. A dial indicator can help measure wear.\n\nWhen to Replace a Bad Ball Joint\n\nThere\u2019s no need to replace a ball joint as a preventative measure \u2013 the job is too costly and involved for that. But if you\u2019re experiencing symptoms, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s almost time.\nIf the measurement on a dial indicator is higher than the allowable play noted in your vehicle\u2019s service manual, the ball joint should be changed. For example, a truck with an allowable spec of .060 inch should change the ball joint when it surpasses that figure. If it\u2019s less \u2013 say, .040 inch of play \u2013 there might be some light symptoms but it\u2019s still safe for the time being. If your ball joint has play and there\u2019s no allowable movement, it should be changed right away.\nOr, if the rattling and clunking are driving you nuts, it could be worthwhile to replace a ball joint before it exceeds the allowable play.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Sway Bar Link",
        "content": "Tools and Parts Needed for the Job\n\nA sway bar link is a short section of steel or reinforced aluminum that\u2019s connected at either end to the control arm or the strut and the sway bar. Changing it doesn\u2019t take much for equipment, but you\u2019ll need a few things to ensure it\u2019s going to go well. You\u2019ll need:\n\nA floor jack and jack stands\nLug nut wrench\nPenetrating fluid\nA wrench set\nA ratchet and socket set\nVice grips or pliers\nGloves and eye protection\nA new sway bar link\nTorque wrench\n\nIf the sway bar link is broken, stripped, or seized, you might also need a cut-off wheel on a disc grinder or angle grinder.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Replacing a Sway Bar Link\n\nWith your tools and parts collected, you\u2019re ready to get going. Here are the steps to change the link.\n\n1. Raise the Vehicle\n\nPark your vehicle on a smooth, level surface if possible. Then lift the wheel off the ground where you\u2019re changing the sway bar link using the floor jack. It\u2019s not considered safe to work on your vehicle with only the floor jack holding it since it could move or fall, so secure your vehicle on a jack stand.\n\n2. Locate the Sway Bar Link\n\nThe sway bar link is pretty easy to identify if you already have the new part in hand. There are a few different styles, and yours might be fastened by a straight stud and nut or it could be a small ball joint. To see it clearly and make room to work, it\u2019s best to remove the wheel. Use the lug nut wrench to pull it off.\n\n3. Remove the Old Sway Bar Link\n\nRemoving the sway bar link is the toughest part of the process. And even so, you shouldn\u2019t need too long to figure it out. Begin by spraying the fasteners at both ends of the link with penetrating fluid, then let it sit for at least five minutes to let it work.\nThe link or the ball and socket is likely to spin when you try to loosen it. Clamp a pair of vice grips onto the link securely, or on the ball and socket to stop it from spinning. On some vehicles, there might be a notch where a wrench fits instead. Then, use your ratchet and socket to begin loosening the nut on one end. Then, repeat the process on the other end.\nIf you can\u2019t prevent the link or joint from spinning, no matter how much you try, you may need to cut the link free. Your cutting wheel can get in close to do it, but be sure you don\u2019t contact any other parts like brake lines, calipers, or CV joints.\n\n4. Install the New Sway Bar Link\n\nWith the old link off, you\u2019re free to put the new link in. There will be two fasteners, just like the old one. Position the new link and start the nuts on the ends of the link, then tighten them down. Use a torque wrench to finish the job, ensuring they\u2019re tightened to at least 14 lb. ft.\n\n5. Test the Link\n\nNext, ensure the link is tight. Start by firmly grasping the link and trying to move it vertically and laterally. There shouldn\u2019t be any play or noises. If is, either the link isn\u2019t tight or mounting holes are oblonged and there are additional parts you\u2019ll need to replace.\nThen, take a road test and listen for noises. A good installation will eliminate any clunking or rattling from the\u00a0 sway bar link when you\u2019re going over uneven surfaces.\n\nTips for a Successful Replacement\n\nGetting the job done right isn\u2019t very hard, but there are a few tips that can help the job go even better.\u00a0\n\nHave a second person available to help you.\nCompare the old and new links before removing the old ones, confirming you have the right ones.\u00a0\nWhen you don\u2019t have room to cut a link off, apply heat with a propane torch.\nA seized nut can be cut crosswise and hammered open with a screwdriver sometimes.\nCheck that the sway bar bushings are in good shape, and replace them if they are cracked or worn.",

        "content": "Symptoms of a Bad Sway Bar\n\nThe symptoms of a bad sway bar aren\u2019t always unique \u2013 some other problems and concerns might seem more plausible. However, if you have one or more of these signs, the sway bar should be checked:\n\nIncreased body roll in a corner. As you make a turn, your vehicle will lean more on its outside wheels and roll excessively outward since the sway bar isn\u2019t balancing the vehicle side-to-side properly.\nUnusually tight turn radius during cornering. It\u2019s due to the diminished stability caused by the faulty sway bar.\nSuspension noise. Clunks and rattles are common when the sway bar is damaged or worn. Sway bar bushings or end links have excessive play, contributing to metallic clunks.\n\u00a0Uneven tire wear. A strong indicator of a sway bar issue is abnormal tire wear since there\u2019s abnormal weight born on the outer edge of the tire during cornering.\n\nSpotting these symptoms early on can help you prevent more costly repairs down the line and get your vehicle back up to speed quickly.\n\nCauses of a Bad Sway Bar\n\nMost often, a bad sway bar will be caused by worn bushings or weak or worn stabilizer bar end links. When bushings have more play than they should have within the bracket, it can cause extra stress on the sway bar itself as it moves back and forth slightly. And when sway bar links break or become lose, they can damage the mounting hole at the end of a sway bar that can eventually snap.\nAlso, a collision or severe impact with a pothole or curb can break the sway bar. Or, if you overload your vehicle constantly, it can stress the sway bar and other suspension components when you\u2019re cornering.\nUnfortunately, these symptoms of a bad sway bar can often go undetected until the sway bar reaches a point where it is unable to achieve its intended purpose. If you\u2019re experiencing any of these symptoms, it\u2019s a good idea to have your vehicle checked right away.\n\nImportance of Replacing a Bad Sway Bar\n\nDriving with a bad sway bar is a dangerous proposition. You may not realize it, but a bent or broken sway bar can reduce ride comfort and increase tire wear too. It interferes with suspension motion, limiting its effectiveness in reducing body roll and providing increased stability when cornering or maneuvering around obstacles.\nA bad sway bar can not only impede your ability to control and handle your vehicle, but it can also be the cause of an accident. If your vehicle doesn\u2019t respond properly during emergency maneuvers, you could lose control due to decreased traction at the outside wheel.\nTo maximize driving safety and performance, it is essential to recognize when a sway bar is faulty and needs replacing as soon as possible. Installing a new one as soon as possible is recommended since the consequences could be disastrous without it.\n\nWhether you\u2019re changing the parts yourself or bringing it to a pro, find your new sway bar and other suspension parts at AutoZone.

        "title": "What You Need to Know About Air Bag Suspension\u00a0",
        "content": "Parts of an air bag suspension kit\u00a0\n\nIn an airbag suspension kit, you\u2019ll typically receive an upper and lower mount to secure the airbag to the vehicle. Hardware to fasten the system in place is also included. You\u2019ll receive lines that attach to the airbags with fittings that allow them to be inflated and deflated.\u00a0\u00a0\nBy far, the most important part of the kit are the airbags themselves. Constructed out of automotive-grade rubber \u2013 the same type used to manufacture tires \u2013 they\u2019re extremely durable and are intended to withstand extreme pressure and inclement weather conditions. The more air pressure they have, the more support they provide for your vehicle\u2019s suspension.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome air bag suspensions are manually inflated and deflated with a valve stem, whether directly at the air bag or, more commonly, at the end of a braided hose that gets mounted at the rear bumper. Other systems are automatically pressurized using an air compressor wired into your truck\u2019s electrical system so they can be adjusted on the fly with a switch inside the cab.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPros of airbag suspension\u00a0\n\nNot everyone will appreciate the benefits of an airbag suspension system unless you\u2019re familiar with how a truck\u2019s dynamics change with weight in the box or on the trailer hitch. Pros of using airbag suspension include:\u00a0\u00a0\nA more comfortable ride with a load. Rather than a saggy, bouncy feel when you\u2019re going over even the smallest bumps or potholes, airbags provide additional support and comfort since you\u2019re floating on air \u2013 literally.\u00a0More stable handling. If you\u2019ve hauled heavy loads, you\u2019ve felt how the steering gets looser and stopping distances increase. Airbags help keep your truck level, minimizing the effect on handling.\u00a0Flexible usage. Since airbags can be inflated and deflated based on your needs, it takes a short time to convert your truck from a comfortable passenger vehicle to a heavy hauler.\u00a0Level headlights. With weight on the trailer hitch or in the truck bed, your headlights tend to point more skyward, drawing headlight flashes at night as if your high beams are on. Air bag suspension keeps your lights more level, benefiting both you and other drivers.\u00a0\n\nCons of an air suspension system\u00a0\n\nWith air bag suspension, there are things to keep in mind that can make you think twice.\u00a0\u00a0\nInstallation can be complicated. Fitting the mounts, balancing the airbag pressures, routing the lines, and mounting and wiring the compressor can relegate this type of system to a professional install in many cases.\u00a0\u00a0It can be costly. At $400 and up, there is an upfront cost to installing an airbag suspension kit.\u00a0\u00a0It needs upkeep. While there\u2019s not much to do for maintenance per se, airbags can tear or rupture, and cracking naturally occurs over time. You might need to replace an airbag every couple of years, and inspecting for problems should be part of your service routine.\u00a0When they fail, it can be bad. If an airbag springs a leak with a load in the back, it can be dangerous trying to maintain control with the sudden change.\u00a0\n\nTypes of airbag suspension\u00a0\n\nThere are two broad categories for air bag suspension kits, and you need to match the right kit to your vehicle design.\u00a0\u00a0\nSleeve style air springs\u00a0\n\nThis type of air suspension has a sleeve that folds in on itself. One end folds in on itself when it\u2019s compressed, and extends as the ride height increases.\u00a0 The vertical inflation and travel make it perfect for use in tight spots, and you\u2019ll often find these air springs in kits for light-duty trucks and SUVs or in coil spring setups.\u00a0\n\nConvoluted air springs\u00a0\n\nAlso called bellows air springs, it looks like one or two balloons that spread the load by squishing outward. They tend to be wider in diameter and can work very well in applications without space constraints. These convoluted air springs are what you\u2019ll find in most leaf spring applications and in heavy-duty vehicles like work trucks and RVs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat does air bag suspension cost?\u00a0\n\nAs a piece of equipment that has several levels of quality and capacity among the two different types, the prices can range greatly. Expect that the higher the load weight you need to bear, the more expensive the kit will cost. Also, the kit is usually per axle. Most installations are on the rear axle, and there may be kits for the front suspension too.\u00a0\nAir bag suspension kits range from around $400 to $1,000 including everything you need to complete a manual-adjusting install. A compressor kit can add $1,000 to $2,000 to the parts cost. Installation should be accounted for if you don\u2019t plan to install it on your own, and that could be around a day\u2019s labor for an experienced tech.",

        "title": "How Much Does a Wheel Bearing Replacement Cost?",
        "content": "Below is a general guide to the cost of replacing a failing wheel bearing.\n\nFront-Wheel Bearings \u2013 Traditional Cone or Roller\n\n1. Two Wheel Drive (2WD)\n\nTraditional cone or roller bearings in older 2WD vehicles are often serviced when removing the rotors during a brake job. These bearings can easily be replaced, are less expensive to buy, and generally cost around $6-20.00 per unit, and $80-100.00 to service, along with the cost of replacing the rotor usually, as the bearing race is pressed in. All in, labor and rotor, most vehicles will run around $150.00 to replace and go up depending on rotor cost. In many cases, it\u2019s cheaper to replace the rotor than it is to remove and press in a new bearing race. \n\n2. Four Wheel Drive (4WD)\n\nThese vehicles up until very recently still used hub systems that house roller bearings or cone style. While these bearings themselves are often as cheap as 2WD vehicles, the process of removing them and disassembling the hub is often a little more time-intensive. Expect to pay for 1-1.5 hours of labor per side, which is usually $80-160.00, plus the bearings to replace. Keep in mind if the race is damaged in the hub, it will need to be pressed out, and a new race pressed in, leading to more time. \n\nFront Wheel Bearings \u2013 Hub Style\n\n1. Complete Unit\n\nThe vast majority of vehicles today use a complete-unit hub bearing. Here, the cost of the bearing is usually the bulk of the expense, as most hub bearings run between $80.00 to $300.00. Many of these have ABS sensors built into them. These bearings are unbolted from the steering knuckle, and a new bearing bolted on. Expect to pay for 1-2 hours of labor to replace per side, usually between $80-200.00.\n\n2. Pressed-On Unit\n\nPopular in German and Japanese vehicles, these units are the sealed roller bearing that you see on the back of the complete unit. In these cases, the entire steering knuckle must often be removed from the vehicle, and the bearing pressed out, and the new one pressed in. While the cost of the bearing drastically diminishes (usually these run between $25.00-50.00) the labor involved to replace the bearing goes up, usually to the tune of 2-4 hours to replace ($160-400.00).\n\nRear-Wheel Bearings\n\n1. Typical Units\n\nRear wheel bearings today are usually no different than fronts in terms of a complete hub bearing or pressed-on units. In the vast majority of cases here, a complete unit is used and unbolted / bolted to the rear transaxle (2WD vehicles) or independent rear axle.\n\n2. Solid Rear Drive Axle\n\nIn the case of most vans and trucks today, along with older RWD cars, the rear wheel bearings are housed inside the solid axle, and are usually pressed into the axle tube, or pressed onto the drive axle itself. In either case, the cost of the bearing is usually between $25.00-50.00, whereas the labor to remove and press in a new bearing runs between 1-4 hours.\n\nOnce again, these are all just approximations. However, they are a great indication of what you can anticipate paying. Fortunately, wheel bearings last a long time, so you won\u2019t need to change them very frequently.\nCan You Drive a Car with a Bad Wheel Bearing?\nWith the wheel bearing replacement cost in mind, you may be wondering if you can drive with a bad wheel bearing. A bad wheel bearing needs to be changed\u00a0as soon as possible. There is no lubrication on a bad wheel bearing. Consequently, as you drive with a bad wheel bearing, you\u00a0run the risk of the wheel bearing completely failing and breaking apart, which can cause massive stability problems when driving, even a crash.\u00a0If you\u2019re in the middle of nowhere and you need to drive a short way to get help to prevent this scenario, you should drive at a slower speed so that your wheel remains intact for a couple more hours.\nCan You Replace Wheel Bearings Yourself?\n\nHow Long Does it Take to Replace Wheel Bearings?\nWhile you can lower your wheel bearing replacement cost by doing it yourself, be prepared to invest a bit of time\u00a0into\u00a0the repair. Experience is among the key elements impacting completion time\u00a0and the estimates above are based on professional book times, not \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the first time\u201d times.\u00a0First-timers should expect the job to take around\u00a04-6\u00a0hours.\nCan\u00a0You Check Wheel Bearings?\nWhen doing any regular vehicle maintenance or if you suspect a wheel bearing issue,\u00a0they\u00a0can be inspected. Do the following to check your bearings for wear without taking the wheels off.\n\nHow to Inspect Wheel Bearings\n\n1. Raise the vehicle\n\nJack the vehicle up and support on jack stands.\n\n2. Try to Rock the Tires\n\nWithout getting under the car, grab each wheel at the top and bottom with both hands. You bottom hand should reach under the tire to the backside. Your top hand should grab the front top portion of the tire. Now, try to rock the tire back and forth by pulling outward with the bottom hand, and inward with the top hand, then reversing the motion.\nThere should be very little motion in the tire. If you have any movement at all, either a wheel bearing, or ball joint is at fault.\n\n3. Check the Lower Ball Joint\n\nNext, if movement is present, inspect the lower ball joint (and upper if applicable) and see if the movement is coming from a worn ball joint. If ball joints are tight, then the wheel bearing is suspect. \n\n4. Put it in Neutral\n\nPut the gearshift in neutral if you have an AWD or FWD vehicle (if you are inspecting the front wheel bearing).\n\n5. Spin the Tire by Hand\n\nSpin the wheel/tire by hand and listen carefully. You should hear a soft rubbing sound which is just the brake pads gliding over the rotor. A grinding sound centered in the very middle of the wheel is a dead giveaway for a failing wheel bearing. It\u2019s important to note that when wheel bearings first start to go, it will normally be difficult to hear and tell. Usually only a road test under the weight of the vehicle will reveal that the bearing is going out.\n\n6. Shift to Park or Gear and Lower\n\nShift back into park (for an automated transmission) or gear (for a manual transmission) prior to lowering the vehicle to the ground.\n\nIs a Noisy Wheel Bearing Dangerous?\nA humming or rumbling noise\u00a0while driving is usually the prime\u00a0indication of a worn wheel bearing.\u00a0This sound will get louder if you take the wheel and lightly turn one direction of the other at\u00a0speed or\u00a0go on a slight curve in the road at speed.\u00a0Driving on a damaged wheel bearing can be dangerous, considering that the wheel bearing is not sufficiently\u00a0lubed\u00a0and\u00a0friction is\u00a0extremely\u00a0high\u00a0at this point. This friction generates heat,\u00a0which will eventually\u00a0disintegrate\u00a0the bearing more, when can lead to complete failure, wheel off, or loss of control of the vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0This can occur anytime you are driving.\nGive us a call today or stop by your local AutoZone if you have any questions about wheel bearing replacement, where we have all the parts, tools, and advice to get the job done right!

        "title": "How Much a CV Joint Replacement Costs",
        "content": "It\u2019s important to note that the historically, CV axles were often rebuilt by the mechanic by replacing one of the 2 failed CV joints, putting on a new boot, and putting the axle back in. Over time, the cost of new CV axles being massed produced became a better, more cost-effective option than simply replacing the joint, as the axle was ready to install, saving time\u00a0and money. The term, \u201cI need a CV joint replaced\u201d has\u00a0continued on, but in general terms, replacing a CV joint really means replacing a CV Axle, so moving forward we will refer to it as such.\n\nCV Axle Replacement Expenses\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of a Bad CV Joint?\n\nBefore you worry about the CV\u00a0axle\u00a0replacement cost, pay attention to the signs that you need a replacement in the first place. When your CV joint is experiencing some issues, there are a handful of indications that will alert you that you have a problem. Keep your eyes open for any of these, and they\u2019ll be an excellent indicator that there\u2019s something incorrect with the CV joints in your car and truck.\u00a0\n\n1. Noises when Turning\n\nPopping or clicking noises, especially when turning, are a tell-tale sign. As the joint wears, especially without grease, it will pop and click.\n\n2. Cracks on the Boot\n\nWhen doing an oil change, check your CV boots carefully by opening up the ribs of the \u201caccordion\u201d and looking for cracks. A broken boot will fling grease anywhere it can, so look for signs of grease around the joint. If you see any, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the joint fails.\n\n3. Wobbly Axle\n\nA failing CV joint will wobble out of balance. This becomes very evident if the wobbling happens when you press on the gas, as the engine torque causes the axle to wobble. While under the vehicle, you can usually find out which axle is producing the wobble by grabbing the axle near the joint on both sides and push up and down, and side to side. If there\u2019s any slop or movement in the axle, the axle is suspect.\n\n4. Bouncing or Vibrations\n\nBouncing is often a step worse than vibrations, and at this point, the car should not be driven. If an axle completely fails and breaks, it can become a rotating projectile and harm other items in its way \u2013 exhaust, struts, brake lines. It\u2019s not worth risking.\n\nHow Long Can I Go with a Bad CV Axle?\n\nIn the simplest terms, it is risky\u00a0to drive with a bad CV joint\u00a0on an axle. If you discover your vehicle is suffering any of the signs of a bad CV joint, the best thing you can do is get it to a mechanic as quickly as possible\u00a0or replace the joint itself.\nRemember that once the CV boot gets torn, it\u2019s only a matter of time before the axle fails. Failing to address the situation can lead to catastrophic failure of the axle, which as stated above, is a part that is in rotating motion. When it breaks, it will continue at its best to try to rotate, knocking into anything it can. The best method of prevention of CV joint / axle failure is to inspect often. If you take your car in for oil changes, ask the oil tech if he can quick the CV boots for you for issues. It\u2019s often not on a normal inspection, but while they are under-car, it takes less than 2 minutes to look each one over carefully.\nFor answers to more specific questions or for recommendations, visit your local AutoZone and our friendly professionals will be able to help you with\u00a0all of\u00a0your concerns!",

        "title": "Shocks and Struts: What You Need to Know",
        "content": "What is the Suspension on Your Car?\n\n Any suspension system starts with tires. Your tires are the point of contact between the car and the road, and having tires with appropriate tread ensures that this connection remains constant. Your tires allow you to accelerate, decelerate, and turn smoothly. Your tires, wheels, braking system, and axles are known as \u201cunsprung weight\u201d as these are the only components on the car that are not held up by the suspension system\u2019s springs. Tires also can absorb a little bit of the impact of road irregularities, but they cannot handle these alone.\nThe tires work together with the springs in the 4 corners of your vehicle to handle these irregularities. They handle not only the weight of the vehicle and it\u2019s passengers above them, but also keep the unsprung weight under control below it. These springs are connected to various components, such as control arms to pivot, turn, and correct \u2013 to keep the car heading straight when you want to, and to turn when you want to. The problem with any spring is for every reaction, there is an equal and opposite reaction \u2013 meaning, if a spring is compressed during a bump, there will be an equal spring-back reaction, just like a bouncing ball. Without the presence of a damper, or shock absorber, the spring would continue to vibrate and these reactions would spiral out of control. This is where a shock, or strut assembly comes into play.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Shocks and Struts?\n\nThe shock energy from a bump or a rock travels through the spring, and it\u2019s the shock or strut\u2019s job to dampen this reaction. Think about slamming a basketball down on the pavement. The ball has no dampening, and immediately rebounds, with equal force of when you slammed it down. Now, take that same basketball and slam it down into a swimming pool. The ball doesn\u2019t bounce because the water in the pool is acting as the damper. You are allowed to slam the ball down (the spring compressing), but the rebound of the ball has been dampened. All of these suspension components \u2013 the springs, control arms, ball joints, shocks and struts all work in tandem, and often times people refer to shocks and struts as simply \u201cshocks\u201d. That said, they are designed somewhat differently.\n\nWhat are Shocks?\n\nShock absorbers, as stated before, act as a spring damper. Their sole purpose is to travel with the spring, or nearby, and dampen its rebound so the car doesn\u2019t bounce, and stays stable, straight, and glued to the road. They themselves do not support any of the weight of the vehicle as the spring does. Shocks help you absorb and disseminate the energy caused by driving over road irregularities.\n\nWhat Happens when a Shock Absorber Fails?\n\nWhen a shock fails, that corner of the car will become extremely unstable. You\u2019ve probably seen a car on the road that you\u2019re following, and the rear axle is vibrating up and down rapidly even though the car doesn\u2019t appear to be going over any bumps \u2013 this is what a pair of failed rear shocks look like. When a front shock fails, you generally have massive tire hop, and feel this all the way through the steering wheel. In the rear, the car can also feel loose when going over bumps, almost like the rear end of the car is about to kick out, from side to side, or just doesn\u2019t feel stable. Couple this with winter driving, and you have a recipe for an unstable car spinning out.\n\nWhat are Struts?\n\nStruts are an essential structural part of your suspension system as not only are they a shock absorber, but they also house and hold the spring for that side of the car, and function as the upper-link to the body in most systems. Your struts support the actual weight of the vehicle itself, so there are more components in a strut assembly. These assemblies are absolutely essential to steering and movement because they help to maintain the alignment of your car, and the steering ability of your car. Struts can have a coil-type spring, or an airbag spring on them, and generally also have an upper mount and bearing that bears the weight, and turning ability of the car. Here, multiple things on a strut could fail \u2013 not only the shock absorber, but the coil spring or upper mount can fail as well. A failed strut will and can be much more detrimental to the driving ability of the car than a shock absorber can.\n\nWhen Should I Replace Shocks and Struts?\n\nAs with any other component on your automobile, the actual requirements vary depending on the conditions in which you drive your vehicle and also the make and model of the vehicle itself. A very general thought is that most shocks and/or struts will need replacing on a car between 60-100,000 miles of driving or 6-8 years. However, there are many mitigating factors that may extend or shorten the life of your shocks and your struts. Particularly if you are driving on bumpy roads often, such as dirt roads or cobblestone roads, you may need to get your shocks and struts replaced more often as compared to individuals who generally drive on smooth pavement or do lots of highway driving.\nGetting your shocks and struts checked should be part of a yearly tune up done on your automobile. This helps you get a better sense of when these parts are wearing down on your vehicle and need to be replaced.\n\nSigns it\u2019s Time to Replace\n\nThere are many signs that your shocks or struts may need to be inspected and potentially changed. If you notice that your vehicle is responding poorly to your steering input, seems to not rebound and stabilize quickly after bumps, or just doesn\u2019t feel the same going over them, you probably need to have your shocks and struts checked. Any pops, clicks, or noises going over bumps at speed, or speed bumps are also a tell-tale sign that something may be wrong. Stiff steering or noises when turning can also be a sign that there is a problem with your suspension system and possibly the shocks and struts, but may also be in the steering system itself. Unstable braking may indicate an issue with these components as your shocks and struts also stabilize forward and backward forces.\nDoing a DIY visual inspection of your shocks and struts is not very difficult. Typically, when these components start to break down, they start to leak. If you notice any wetness or oily liquid near the shock body, it needs to be checked out. If you notice that your shocks and struts are wearing out, it is also important to pay attention to your tires. Particularly if your struts are wearing out, your tires can wear uneven, as generally the car is not staying in proper contact with the road, or has fallen out of alignment.\n\nHow Much Do Shocks and Struts Cost to Replace?\n\nIn terms of shocks and struts replacement cost, it generally is cheaper and easier to replace shocks than struts. Many people choose to replace their own shocks, given that the shocks are not a structural part of a car\u2019s suspension system, and thus replacing them doesn\u2019t require complicated procedures like compressing coil springs. In recent years,\u00a0pre-assembled \u201cloaded\u201d struts\u00a0have become extremely popular, as these items incorporate the complete package \u2013 the strut, spring, and mount ready to bolt right in, and make the job much, much easier. It is generally advisable though to get struts replaced professionally, since changing out the struts tends to be more complicated. That doesn\u2019t mean that DIY strut jobs are unrealistic though and the job can be tackled at home with the right amount of preparation.",

        "title": "Bad Power Steering Pump: Symptoms & Replacement Cost",
        "content": "Before diving into the specifics of the power steering pump replacement, it is necessary to understand the equipment, symptoms, and safety concerns. As an integral steering component, it is unwise to drive with a failing pump, but how do you know when it is time to replace the part? Also, are you only going to need to replace this part once in the lifetime of your vehicle? The power steering pump is an intricate engine component, and while you may not be able to identify it now, by the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of the purpose of this part and when to replace it. Also, you will understand how the cost of a replacement is broken down, and whether you can save money or not.\n\nUnderstanding the Power Steering Pump\n\nWhat is a power steering pump? Most classic cars did not have power steering, which meant they were harder to turn and control. As steering systems evolved, engineers found ways to ease the steering process using hydraulics. The power steering pump is a critical component of the hydraulic system. The pump circulates and pressurizes power steering fluid. When the pressurized fluid is transferred through a hose to the steering pump, it is used to help turn the wheel. As the wheel turns, another hose returns the fluid back through the pump, where it is pressurized again. The process is continuous while the engine is running, meaning that you are never left without steering assistance. Since most drivers own vehicles equipped with power steering, it quickly becomes obvious when the pump is failing because of\u00a0power steering problems like a hard to turn wheel.\n\nSymptoms of a Bad Power Steering Pump\n\n1. Fluid Leaks\n\nOne of the most common signs of pump failure is a fluid leak. Power steering fluid is a red or reddish-brown color. Check for puddles after driving. While a leak is not a definitive sign of a bad pump, it does signal that there is something wrong with the system.\n\n2. Noises\n\nNext, you may hear the power steering pump making strange noises. If you hear groaning, whining or screeching noises when you turn the wheel or increase engine RPMs, then your power steering pump may be going bad. The pump is driven by a belt, which also can result in strange sounds, so check your belt as well.\n\n3. Hard to Turn Steering Wheel\n\nFinally, as the pump goes bad, you will notice an increased difficulty when turning your car. You will likely struggle the most when going slow or stopped.\n\nSafety and Caution\n\nIf you hear a power steering pump noise or suspect an issue with the system, it is best to have your vehicle towed to a safe location, like your garage or a repair shop. While it is technically safe to drive a car with a leaking power steering pump, you must keep in mind the risk of doing so. If the leak is faster than you expect, then you risk damaging the power steering system. Permanent damage is a risk, which is why it is better to err on the side of caution. Do not drive a vehicle you think has a pump issue. Call for a tow. It is always better to be safe than sorry. While it is best to repair the problem quickly, you may be able to save a few bucks doing the repair yourself, but only if you have the skill set.\n\nCost of Replacement\n\nIt is difficult to specify an exact cost because the price of a replacement part varies based on vehicle make and model. The estimate for the entire pump replacement is $100 to $200 for parts. If you are handy, then you may be able to save around $300, which is a likely cost for labor. Again, these estimates are rough because even labor costs can vary from place to place. While it is tempting to save some money and do the job yourself, keep in mind that a pump repair is likely part of a larger project, requiring a more advanced skill set. You may be able to find a cheaper part and then pay someone to install it, but that depends on the shop.\n\nFrequency of Replacement\n\nMost vehicle components have an expected lifespan, and power steering pumps are no different. A pump typically lasts up to 100,000 miles or better before experiencing any significant issues. However, much of that longevity has to do with maintaining a proper maintenance schedule.\nBecause steering pumps last so long, any repair work is usually found in used vehicles, especially because of how many car owners lease. Although, that does not mean that a younger model won\u2019t experience unexpected failure or problems. Always be mindful of the symptoms and signs of a failing pump, so you can avoid significant harm to your car\u2019s steering system.",

        "title": "How to Replace Ball Joints",
        "content": "What is a Ball Joint?\n\nSo, if you haven\u2019t read our article on control arms and how they work, we recommend checking out that article too.\u00a0A ball joint is a vital part to your car\u2019s\u00a0suspension, and\u00a0is usually housed at the end of a control arm on a vehicle.\u00a0\nA ball joint\u2019s job is to hold the entire suspended weight of the vehicle on its steering point. Basically, when your wheels turn left or right, the ball joint, or ball joints on each side are allowing this to happen. They keep the wheel/tire in correct alignment, while allowing the steering components to turn smoothly. \nSome ball joints are built directly into the Control Arm and are not replaceable. Others are, either by being pressed, bolted, or riveted in. Most front-wheel-drive vehicles have only 2 lower ball joints on each side, as the upper pivot-point is accomplished by the strut assembly. In a traditional rear-wheel drive or full-size\u00a0cars, there is an upper and lower ball joint on each side. Most trucks still take 4 ball joints.\nBall joints fail\u00a0the same way that tie rods fail. Over time, a lack of grease occurs or grease can deteriorate from a torn boot that should protect the it, allowing water and grime to intrude into the joint. As the joint continues to wear back and forth, slop begins to form in what should be a precise joint. \nEventually, it becomes so bad that the joint begins to knock \u2013 which is noticeable when going over bumps and hearing a knock or pop sound. Other symptoms can be wandering steering, along with popping noises in the suspension. Over time, this joint will get so bad, that eventually the ball will completely release from the socket, which will completely free the wheel and steering knuckle from the car, causing catastrophic damage or worse yet, an accident. \nIt\u2019s important to note that back in the day all ball joints, tie rods, and other suspension parts were greaseable, and this service was regularly performed during an oil change (it\u2019s where the term \u201coil and lube\u201d comes from). Over time, many manufacturers began to make sealed, non-serviceable joints, but it\u2019s important to note that many still are serviceable, and if they are, should be greased regularly.\nIn you have concerns about your suspension, it\u2019s recommended that you check our list of\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0in your\u00a0area and\u00a0look specifically for shops that specialize in alignment work. If you want to check out your car yourself, you can check ball joints quickly by doing the following:\n\nSafely jack the vehicle up and secure with proper jack stands. You can leave the wheels on, but make sure you have enough access to get under the front of the vehicle.\nSquatting outside each front tire, reach under the tire in a 5-o\u2019clock / 8-o\u2019clock position and\u00a0lift up\u00a0and out on the tire. There should be zero movement. If you feel any movement, or clicking / knocking when you do, locate the ball joint on that side and have a helper do the same thing. Observe if there is slop in the ball joint when this is performed.\nSome ball joints will need more coercing to troubleshoot. You can also stick a\u00a0crow bar\u00a0or pry bar between the steering knuckle and the lower or upper ball joint. Gently pry and observe if the joint has slop or moves.\n\nIf either of these 2 processes show slop in the joint, the joint will need to be replaced. If its determined that the joint is non-replaceable, then the entire control arm assembly will need to be replaced.\n\nCan You Replace Your Ball Joint?\n\nBall joints are not always an easy replacement, but a\u00a0DIYer\u00a0who is versed in changing suspension and brake components will probably be able to tackle the job. Depending on your vehicle\u2019s set-up, ball joints can either be part of the control arm itself (requiring complete control arm replacement), pressed into the control arm, bolted, or riveted onto the control arm. For\u00a0older or 4X4 trucks, most ball joints are pressed onto the axle, or onto the steering knuckle.\u00a0\n\nGenerally a job to replace ball joints will involve the following, but not exclusive to these\u00a0steps:\u00a0\n\nTaking off your vehicle\u2019s wheels.\nMoving the brake calipers,\u00a0and\u00a0rotor. Some vehicles will need the sway bar links removed.\nFront wheel drive cars \u2013 in most cases, separate the lower control arm from the steering knuckle via a ball joint fork.\nTrucks and some cars \u2013 separate the steering knuckle from the ball joints\u00a0with a ball joint fork\u00a0and set aside.\u00a0This process usually requires a lot of force and a BIG hammer!\nCarefully inspect and remove any snap rings that may be securing the ball joint in place.\nUsing a ball joint press,\u00a0press the old joint out of the control arm.\nUsing the ball joint press, press the new joint into the control arm. Tip \u2013 throw your new ball joints in the freezer overnight before installation. Heat makes things expand, and cold makes\u00a0them contract.\u00a0By freezing the joints, you\u00a0will make installation easier.\n\nAs with\u00a0any repair, consult a repair manual or online source for repair info for your specific vehicle before starting. Be sure you have all the proper tools to complete the job. Some ball joints can be relatively easy while others, especially on older cars that are rusty, can be a real nightmare to break loose.\nDepending on your experience you may want to consult an experienced individual for help and advice,\u00a0in which don\u2019t hesitate to use our list of\u00a0Preferred Shops\u00a0in your area.\n\nHow Much Does Replacement Cost?\n\nThe cost of replacing ball joints varies depending on the vehicle you drive,\u00a0especially when it comes to labor rates.\u00a0The average\u00a0serviceable\u00a0ball joint generally falls somewhere in the range of\u00a0$20-50.00.\u00a0In some cases, you may need to buy a combination control arm and ball joint as a single piece,\u00a0which costs between $100 and $500.00.\u00a0It is considered best practice while diagnosing the ball joint failure to inspect control arm bushings as well to determine if both control arm and ball joint will need to be replaced. Keep in mind that on some vehicles, the control arm bushings are also serviceable.\nIf you want to go the DIY route, you will also need to consider the parts and tools needed to get the job done. You will need equipment to jack up your car as well as the ball joint press itself. This can cost anywhere from around $75 to $250 but\u202fthese tools are also available in AutoZone\u2019s Loan-a-Tool Program.\u00a0Remember that after any suspension or steering parts are replaced, you will need to re-align the vehicle.\nShould you decide to seek a shop to repair your ball joint issues, keep in mind that the labor is generally driving the cost of repair here. Shops will generally\u00a0recommend that both or all ball joints be replaced at the time the car is there because if one has failed, the chances are the others will fail soon. This is a valuable practice that even a\u00a0DIYer\u00a0should follow, even though it doubles the work. Most ball joint jobs are going to run 3-5 hours of work per side, leading to a cost of $350-650.00 in labor costs alone, plus parts.\nShould you choose to do the job yourself, remember that AutoZone not only has all the parts, but all the proper tools to complete the job.

        "title": "What to Know About Sway Bars",
        "content": "What is\u00a0Sway?\n\nYou may have guessed that sway is not good when it comes to vehicles. In its most simple form, sway is the amount of leaning that a vehicle does from one side to another depending on the forces that are acting upon it. Cornering is going to cause a certain amount of sway in a vehicle. No matter what vehicle you are talking about, when it turns there\u2019s going to be a certain amount of lean to the outside. This is sway.\n\nHow Does a Sway Bar Work With The\u00a0Suspension System?\n\nIn order to understand the precise functionality of a sway bar, it is important to understand how the\u00a0suspension system in your vehicle\u00a0works in general. While different vehicles have different purposes where suspension is concerned, all vehicles have certain commonalities in the suspension system.\nFor instance, all suspension systems start with the wheels and tires of the car. In terms of the suspension, the tires give the grip that allows your car to turn, decelerate, and accelerate as necessary. This is why tire tread is so vital when driving as insufficient tire tread may cause issues with your suspension system. Tires also absorb some amount of shock from bumps and other problems in the road.\nUnder the car, the suspension system has springs. These springs help mitigate the shock caused by hitting larger irregularities in the road or bumps. While the tires can absorb a certain amount of shock, springs can absorb more shock from larger road irregularities like potholes.\nSuspension systems also have\u00a0shocks and/or struts in addition to coil springs. These work with the springs. If the car hits a large bump in a road, the spring absorbs the energy, but it is a shock absorber or a strut that actually dissipates the energy. The strut is filled with oil, and this liquid helps dissipate the actual shock. It is here that the car\u2019s bouncing is stopped after hitting a bump or pothole.\nFinally, suspension systems involve a variety of bushings, joints, and linkages. The combination of all of these components are what allow the entire suspension system to move in tandem and respond accordingly to any stimulus given by the road surface or vehicle operator.\nYou may have noticed that we did not directly mention a sway bar as part of the general suspension system of all vehicles. This is because while the majority of cars do have a sway bar, not all of them do. It does depend on the purpose of the car as well as the build.\n\nWhat is a\u00a0Sway Bar?\n\nA Sway bar is a long piece of tubular piece of steel that is bent in various fashions and connected to both the left and right sides of the vehicle. Sway bars can be used in front or rear suspension and often on both. A sway bar limits sway as a car corners. In the event that a car is going around a corner or happens across a rough patch of road, there is a certain amount of lean that is naturally generated. A sway bar prevents the car from leaning too much.\nAt its heart, a\u00a0sway bar is a torsion spring, or metal that resists twisting.\nThe sway bar resists this twisting motion and helps to return the wheels back to an equal height; this in turn levels the vehicle. So, for most of your vehicle\u2019s operation the sway bar is doing very little. However, if any force acts upon the car to push one wheel higher than the other, the sway bar discourages this.\nIn the event that both wheels in the front or the back are undergoing the same amount of force (for example, if both front wheels are in the air due to a bump), the sway bar does nothing.\n\nWhat is a\u00a0Sway Bar Link?\n\nA sway bar link is used to connect the sway bar to the vehicle\u00a0and allow up and down motion to be transferred though he sway bar. Sway bar links can contain bushings and/or ball joints to allow for the range of motion necessary, these components are some of the most common wear items in your vehicles suspension. Both the ball joints and bushings can wear out over time resulting in clunking and the sway bar being less effective in controlling the vehicles sway.\n\nWhy do We Have\u00a0Sway Bars?\n\nThe most important reason to have a sway bar is for safety. It can be very dangerous if a vehicle is upended too much in a turn. Aside from the very obvious danger of a rollover, sway bars help keep the vehicle from sliding in turns. In this way, they prevent the wheels losing grip, which can cause a driver to skid. This can make the car harder to control, particularly when turning or braking.\nHowever, sway bars can have problems as well, which is why they are not applied on all vehicles and not applied the same way on vehicles that do have them. A too-rigid sway bar is one of the more common sway bar link symptoms: it can cause the entire car to feel stiff when going over a bump. It also may increase the likelihood of a wheel becoming airborne if too stiff.\nStiffer sway bars are typically found on cars that are likely to encounter high turning forces on smooth roads. A good example of this would be a racing car or a powerful sports car like a Ford Mustang or a Dodge Charger. These cars have thicker rear and front sway bars, as it is assumed that these cars will be driven on smooth roads at high speeds. Therefore, a stiffer sway bar allows these vehicles to take tight corners with less danger of the car losing its grip on the asphalt and becoming airborne.\nHowever, if you are driving an off-road vehicle, it is likely that the sway bar is far less rigid or potentially may not exist at all, depending. For example, a Jeep Wrangler needs to be able to deal with large bumps. Given that the majority of Jeep Wranglers are also driven on smooth pavement they are very likely to still have some form of sway bar, even if far less rigid than that of a racing car. However, Wranglers or other off-road vehicles that are solely dedicated to driving off-road may have their sway bars removed entirely.",

        "title": "What Does a Control Arm Do? Bad Control Arm Symptoms",
        "content": "What Does A Control Arm\u00a0Do?\nTo keep it simple, the control arm is a link that connects the frame of the car to the\u00a0wheel hub assembly\u00a0or steering knuckle. Control arms can come in many different shapes in sizes, upper Control arms are often call \u201cA\u201d arms as they have a shape vaguely like a capital letter A. The control arm(s) move up and down with the spring when a car hits a bump or other road irregularity. This allows the tires to maintain contact with the road and, thus, control. The control arm is part of the suspension system that helps your car remain in full contact with the road at all times, that\u2019s giving you necessary control.\nIn most control arms, the two lower parts of the \u201cA\u201d are attached to the frame via control arm bushings, which are rubber pivot-points. The top of the \u201cA\u201d is attached to the steering knuckle by way of a ball joint. In older vehicles, this ball joint is serviceable on its own, without the need to remove or replace the control arm. On most newer vehicles, the ball joint is incorporated into the design of the control arm, hence, the entire arm must be replaced. Vehicles can have a different numbers of control arms. Some have as few as just one lower control arm, many vehicles an upper and a lower, and some even have more elaborate, multi-link arm set-ups.\nWhen a control arm fails, multiple things can happen. Most failures occur from the ball joint failing. Complete ball joint failure can cause a steering knuckle disconnection and loss of control of the vehicle. Control arm bushings can also wear and fail, creating clunking, wandering steering, and loss of control. Before your control arm gets to this point, be on the lookout for these signs.\n\nBad Control Arm Symptoms\n\n1. Popping Noise\n\nOne of the earliest signs of a failing control arm is hearing a popping noise when you drive over road irregularities. You may also hear a popping noise when you speed up or reduce the speed of your vehicle, but normally going over bumps at slower speeds, like speed bumps is an indicator of a ball joint that is popping, or possible worn bushings.\n\n2. Steering is Unstable\n\nAnother symptom that can indicate control arm problems is unstable steering. This is very common in failing bushings, where the alignment of the steering wanders, causes the car to veer either to the left or the right when the driver runs over a bump in the road. This issue becomes more apparent if the car is driving on uneven surfaces or unstable terrain. This symptom may also indicate that your idler arm or steering tie rods are in bad shape, so when inspecting, make sure to check the steering components.\nConsistent vibration throughout the vehicle could also be an indicator that the control arm may be starting to fail, but not exclusive to this. Given that the control arm absorbs a lot of the energy and is the link between the suspension and the frame, other issues like unbalanced tires, or failing steering components will only be worse if your control arms also have weak components.\n\n3. Uneven Tire Wear\n\nUneven tire wear is also a potential sign of a failing control arm, as this is an indicator of alignment issues. As control arm bushings wear, this can force the vehicle out of alignment, causing wear on the outer or inner edges of the tire. While sometimes this is just an indicator that a proper alignment is needed, it can also be caused because of worn bushings. Any alignment shop will be able to properly diagnose this. You can search here for a list of Preferred Repair Shops in your area that can deal with alignments and suspension diagnosis like control arms.\n\nWhat to Do About Control Arm Problems\nIf you are noticing any of the above symptoms,\u00a0get your car to a shop for a full suspension check. If you are an avid\u00a0DIYer, get your car up on jack stands and thoroughly check out the control arms and front steering for any issues.\u00a0In the event that\u00a0your control arm or another suspension link or arm fails while you are driving, you want to try to slow the car down and get it off the road if you can. Remember that in the event of a complete failure of the control arm that you may be unable to steer the car.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "MacPherson Struts vs. Double Wishbone Suspension",
        "content": "Double Wishbone Suspension\u00a0Basics\n\nOf the two dominant suspension models in use today, double wishbone is older, but not by much. It predates the MacPherson strut design by a little more than a decade. Double wishbone designs got their name from the shape of their design, which relies on the\u00a0shock absorbers and coil springs\u00a0connecting both upper and lower\u00a0control arms, with the lower arm connected to the steering knuckle and the upper arm attached to the frame of the vehicle.\nToday, double wishbone suspension is more commonly found on vehicles that have a body/frame construction, while MacPherson struts are more commonly found on unibody designs. Some car owners interpret this to mean that double wishbone is used for trucks and vans whereas the alternative is for sedans and compact cars, but that would be an over-generalization. Vehicle design is too nuanced to make assumptions, which is why you need to check out your automotive maintenance manual if you\u2019re wondering which kind of suspension you have.\n\nThe Basics of\u00a0MacPherson Struts\n\nWhile this strut design was named after the engineer who popularized it and refined it to its most recognizable form, the basic concept predates MacPherson\u2019s work, as other designs using almost the same concept for a front-end suspension had been marketed prior to Ford\u2019s first official MacPherson strut model.\nThe design is notably different from double wishbone suspensions, with the strut bolted to the hub carrier and directly connected to the body of the vehicle. In the MacPherson design, the strut is part of the steering geometry, providing the axis of inclination in that design. Typically, vehicles with MacPherson struts feature a coil spring above the shock absorber.\nMacPherson struts benefit from a simpler design than double wishbone builds, and they also provide a smoother ride at highway speeds. Due to their construction, they are more common on unibody vehicles.\n\nComparing the\u00a0Suspension Designs\n\nThe difference between MacPherson struts and double wishbone suspension is easy to understand from a construction standpoint, but you might be wondering why the two totally different designs have continued to coexist when many other automotive systems have found a dominant design model over time.\nThe fact is, there are pros and cons to each design. Understanding that requires a look at the drawbacks to each design, so you can see when it would be less advantageous in certain vehicles. Let\u2019s look at the older suspension design first:\n\nDouble wishbone\u2019s complexity of design means more parts, and in turn, more parts that can fail\nIt also has greater interdependence, meaning one part going bad can cause others to break before a fix is put in place\nIt\u2019s a much heavier suspension, adding more weight to the vehicle\n\nBy contrast, MacPherson struts avoid those issues, but have their own set of drawbacks:\n\nThey are tall, so tall they often raise the profile of the vehicle and limit how low its ride height can be set\nThis also moves up the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity\nAs they show wear, they often transmit more noise through the body of the car than double wishbone designs\nTheir participation in the steering geometry can lead to trouble keeping solid contact with the road on all four wheels during cornering\nTorque steer is an issue at high speeds in FWD vehicles\n\nLooking at the drawbacks and limitations of each design, it gets easier to see how the double wishbone suspension has held onto its corner of the market over the years. It might be more delicate, but it also allows for a lower center of gravity, better contact with the ground during cornering, and less torque steer, making it ideal for many smaller body performance cars, not just larger vehicles like trucks where the extra weight is less likely to be noticed. It\u2019s also worth thinking about the increased weight of the double wishbone design as a neutral factor, because while it can hurt fuel efficiency it can help with traction when a vehicle is heavier, so it\u2019s less a solid drawback and more a design feature that is sometimes desirable and sometimes not.\nEven with the drawbacks the MacPherson design has, it\u2019s still a solid performer and a much smoother ride at highway speeds. When the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity won\u2019t be artificially raised by the use of the architecture, it\u2019s a good economy option for passenger vehicles that don\u2019t necessarily need to worry about a lot of high-speed cornering.\nSome newer MacPherson style designs further improve on its efficiency by separating the strut from the steering geometry to lower torque steer and avoid the issue relating to contact surfaces while cornering, and that does a lot to even up the performance between the two.\n\nMaintaining\u00a0Your Vehicle\u2019s Suspension\n\nMacPherson struts last a long time, and they\u2019re less likely to have collateral damage happen to other parts when they wear, if they are replaced promptly. To make sure you\u2019re staying on top of your strut performance, it is recommended that you check them every 50,000 miles to be sure they\u2019re still working efficiently. If you notice that you\u2019re getting worse performance, replace them before the issue becomes noticeable in day to day driving.\nFor double wishbone suspension designs, you are likely to notice problems holding alignment when a part wears significantly. It\u2019s a good idea to inspect them regularly, but the change in vehicle alignment also serves as notice you should check them out right away, so you can determine which parts need to be replaced before putting in your order. You can find those parts easily using the\u00a0VIN lookup\u00a0on our site to make sure you only see the parts for your make and model.",

        "title": "Bad Tie Rod Symptoms to Watch Out For",
        "content": "What Are\u00a0Tie Rod Ends?\n\nA tie rod is a threaded steel or cast iron tube, with a small pivoting ball joint on the end. Its purpose is to connect the steering gear mechanism (either a gear box or rack and pinion) outward to the wheels. Tie rods are generally divided between inner tie rods, which attach directly to the rack and pinion, and outer tie rods, which attach to the steering knuckle out by the wheel. These two tie rods are usually connected with an adjusting sleeve, or the inner and outer simply connect, with the inner being the adjusting device. This allows adjustment and precise alignment of the two wheels/tires. When you turn your steering wheel either left or right, this structure is responsible for conveying that movement to the wheels and ultimately turning the car in the direction you want it to go.\nTie rod ends also contain several internal parts you should be aware of. The small ball joint mentioned earlier on the end of the tie rod contains a bearing, similar to suspension ball joints. This bearing allows this joint to flex freely up or down with suspension travel or turn in and out with the turning of the wheels/tires. This joint is protected by a rubber boot that keeps lubricating grease in, and water/dirt out. Just like suspension ball joints, tie rods historically have had grease fittings to keep them properly lubricated, although many today are not serviceable.\n\nIdentifying Potential\u00a0Tie Rod Issues\n\nAs you can see, a car\u2019s tie rod ends have a lot to do with how well you can control your car, so you\u2019ll definitely want to learn the signs of tie rod ends that need to be serviced or replaced sooner. The following are among the most common problems to keep an eye out for.\n\nDo you tires appear to be wearing unevenly or excessively? This could indicate a number of problems, and a tie rod end that\u2019s failing could easily be one of them. Faulty tie rod ends can cause unusually heavy wear on either the inner or the outer portion of the tire, so make sure you check for both. You can\u00a0read more about ball joints here.\nOne of the primary symptoms of faulty or failing tie rod ends can also cause your\u00a0steering wheel\u00a0to feel loose or wandering when you\u2019re operating your vehicle. This is caused from the joint on the end of the tie rod deteriorating, creating slop. Over time, this joint can get so bad that it begins to knock going over bumps, and eventually so bad, that it can physically separate from the tie rod itself, sending the knuckle and wheel completely sideways.\nAs stated before, when tie rods get to a failure state that is dangerously serious, they will begin to pop and click, as this joint gets loose. If you hear any of these noises turning or going over bumps, keep in mind that it could be a myriad of suspension items, but doing a thorough tie rod check can rule the tie rods out.\n\nTo perform a tie rod check, it\u2019s best to first put your vehicle on drive-up ramps as this allows you to check the tie rods under the load of vehicle weight. You can perform this with the car jacked up and on secure jack stands as well, but the ramp method is preferred. Once the car is lifted, locate both outer tie rods on the steering knuckle and follow them inward to the inner tie rods. Grab ahold of this steering rod with your hand and attempt to move it straight up and down. Listen and feel for any looseness or clicking as there should be none. Do the same by attempting to move the rod forward and back \u2013 towards the front and rear of the car. Now, grab the rod and try to twist it. A good tie rod, both inner and outer should have either no twist, or a slight twist in both directions as you will see the outer tie rod pivot back and forth allowing this twist. If this joint is extremely loose and requires no effort at all to twist, the joint is going bad.\nSometimes during the alignment process, a shop may tell you that a tie rod is bad because it is seized inside the adjusting sleeve, or the inner and outer units are seized together. This is rather common on old suspension parts and usually requires complete replacement, or a longer job and use of heat / torch and multi treatments of penetrating lubricant to break these two free. You may encounter this at some point where a shop will give you the dreaded phone call of, \u201cWe can\u2019t align it\u201d. If this happens, you\u2019ll need to replace parts and get it back in for alignment again.\n\nTaking Care of Your\u00a0Tie Rod Ends\n\nAs stated before, historically, tie rods, ball joints, and even some bushings on your car have all had greaseable fittings to allow regularly greasing of these items during oil change. Within the last 15 years, many manufacturers have gone to sealed bearings that are non-serviceable. Many though, still require grease and if you have these, they should be greased on a regular basis. You should see a grease fitting directly on the head of the outer tie rod, right on the steering knuckle. Give it a quick cleaning and then use a grease gun to push new, clean lubrication through the rod. As you push new grease in, you\u2019ll see the old grease come out along with any dirt, debris, or grit that may have become stuck in it over time. It\u2019s just one extra step added to your\u00a0oil change routine, but it can make a\u202fbig\u202fdifference in the lifespan of your tie rod ends.\n\nShop Suspension, Steering, Tire, and Wheel Parts",

        "content": "KNOW THE CHASSIS LUBRICATION POINTS\n\nChassis lubrication not only covers the actual lubrication of these components, but also a visual inspection to determine that the lubricant is staying where it should. Here are some common lubrication points on vehicles.\n\nSway bar bushings and end-links\nControl Arm Bushings\nBall Joints (King Pins on older vehicles)\nTie Rod Ends (Inner and Outer)\nDrag Links, Idler Arms, some Pitman Arms\n\nOn vehicles using U-joints in the driveshaft, many of these are greaseable and should be considered when doing chassis lubrication.\n\nHOW TO LUBRICATE CHASSIS PARTS\n\nOnce you have identified all the locations you will need to lubricate, you need to make them accessible. Since the chassis parts are mostly accessible from the underside of the car, that means it will need to be put up on jack stands or hoisted on a lift. If you are working without a full lift, remember to use secure jack stands and braces, not just a hydraulic jack. The weight distribution and secure placement you get with proper stands is a vital safety measure.\nNext up, you\u2019ll need to load your grease gun. Here\u2019s how that works if you\u2019ve never used one before:\n\nHOW TO LOAD A GREASE GUN\n\n1. LOCK YOUR\u00a0GREASE GUN\n\nPull back the plunger on the grease gun and lock it into place. You should feel a click when it locks. If you aren\u2019t sure that it has locked, lower your draw pressure without letting go and see if it tries to retract. If it does, keep pulling. Some grease guns take a little muscle to lock open.\n\n2. OPEN THE BARREL\n\nUnscrew the main barrel that holds the grease. If you started with a loaded gun and you are reloading, remember to clear out the old grease tube.\n\n3. OPEN THE CARTRIDGE\n\nThe new cartridge has a pull tab on one end to open it. That tab goes on the pump head side. The other side has a plastic cap, that goes on the plunger side.\n\n4. LOAD THE GREASE TUBELOAD THE GREASE TUBE\n\nRemove the plastic cap and pull tab, then seat the grease tube in the barrel. If your old tube had any extra left, pack it in to the new one\n\n5. PUT IT BACK TOGETHER\n\nScrew the barrel together, and give the grease gun a few pumps to insure you are getting grease out of the connecting coupler. Some grease guns have a draw handle that must be pulled back when installing a new cartridge, so check the manual for your grease gun to insure you are loading it properly\n\nNow you\u2019re ready to climb under the vehicle and lubricate the points you already identified. Of course, they can look a lot different once you are under the vehicle than they did when you were planning things out. Make sure you have an\u00a0automotive maintenance manual\u00a0on hand or search online for your exact lubrication points. Any serviceable component on the vehicle that can accept grease will have a grease zerk on it. This is a small nipple that accepts the grease guns connector, snapping onto it and allowing for grease to flow from the gun into the component. It\u2019s important to wipe off the zerk from dust and dirt before hooking up.\nOnce you snap onto a zerk, begun pumping the grease gun. Your grease gun lever should pump with minimal resistance and after 2-3 pumps, you should begin to see grease being forced out of the joint or dust boot. Once you see this, you can stop once you see fresh grease being forced out. Use a paper towel to wipe the excess off, and unhook the grease gun connector. Now, you can move on.\n\nRemember, not all of you lubrication points will have\u00a0grease fittings. Many modern day components are built with sealed components, meaning, they are greased at assembly, and sealed. For polyurethane components, like bushings that aren\u2019t greaseable, a sprayable silicone can work, or an all-purpose grease. For metal joints and bushings, that have no zerk, you will need to disassemble the component, apply grease directly to the contact surfaces, and then reinstall it.\n\nINSPECTING THE\u00a0UNDERSIDE OF YOUR VEHICLE\n\nBefore calling the project complete and lowering the car, it\u2019s good practice to inspect the components you just serviced and make sure nothing needs replacement. A common fail-point, for example, are tie rods and steering components that have a dust boot covering the joint. These boots protect the grease, but fail over time by cracking and falling off. Inspect each dust boot carefully, and inspect the bushings you are greasing for cracking as well. Be sure to grab steering components and attempt to move up and down, along with side to side, and twist. You are looking for any major play in the components that could indicate you need replacements.\nRemember, U-joints on rear-wheel drive vehicles require spinning the drive shaft to reach many of the grease zerks, so the vehicle needs to be in neutral. While you are spinning the joints, take the time to see if it has any play sliding fore and aft. If it does, that\u2019s a pretty good sign the u-joints need replacing.\nFor Front-Wheel drive vehicles, CV joints should always be inspected to insure none of the boots are cracked, and are leaking out their vital lubrication grease. If you find a cracked boot quickly, you can often replace / regrease the joint, but if it has been cracked for too long, often replacement is needed.\nTaking the time to lubricate your chassis components is vital to keeping your car driving and steering properly, and avoiding costly replacements. If the job appears too hard, remember to check out one of our Preferred Shops in your area, that can help with not only an oil change, but proper lubrication. If you want to tackle the job yourself, your local AutoZone has all the grease supplies, and advice you\u2019ll need to get the job done.",

        "title": "Leaf Springs Vs. Coil Springs",
        "content": "What Are Leaf Springs and Coil Springs?\n\nA leaf spring comprises of several curved, long, thin strips which are stacked in terms of their length and then connected via a bolt in the center of the strips. Both ends of the rear axle in a vehicle have leaf springs attached in this system, and this helps to support the suspension in the rear. Leaf springs are very, very popular, and can be found everywhere from trucks, to SUVs, to vans, to cars. A leaf spring helps a vehicle absorb shock and keep the ride comfortable for passengers and drivers.\nOn the other hand, coil springs are, as it says on the tin, coils of metal. These coils are flexible and firm and ride on top of the axle. They look somewhat similar to Slinkys in nature, only they are much, much more rigid than the toys are. A coil spring helps to store and then release energy that a vehicle produces through movement. Coil springs tend to only be found on trucks and other performance vehicles.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: Leaf Springs\n\nLeaf springs are the more common suspension system of the two. This is largely because their function is very straightforward given that they support the axle in the spring assembly. This makes the setup of the suspension overall less complicated. Leaf springs also allows a vehicle to have greater back load capacity.\nHowever, leaf springs are not always the best choice for very challenging drives. They do not offer as much flexibility as coil springs do. In difficult terrain, a leaf spring suspension system can cause the wheels to not connect with the ground as well as a coil system would. Leaf springs are also difficult to adjust because they are very firmly attached at the rear of the vehicle chassis.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages: Coil Springs\n\nCoil springs allow the suspension system to flex much more than a leaf spring system does. This means that many high-performance trucks go for the coil spring suspension system rather than leaf spring. A coil system allows more movement in the suspension system, making them a better choice for difficult terrain.\nHowever, coil systems tend to cost more to install as compared to leaf spring systems. Plus, coil springs are not as good at handling heavier loads, therefore they are not a good choice for particularly heavy vehicles. Retrofitting a vehicle with coil springs is often seen as impractical.\n\nIs a Leaf Spring or a Coil Spring Better for Performance?\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer, considering it depends entirely upon what you need your vehicle to be doing. Different situations require different suspension systems.\nLeaf springs are very practical in stop-and-go traffic, which is part of the reason they are much more commonly installed on commuter vehicles. Leaf springs help your vehicle absorb the shock from constantly applying the brakes. Leaf springs are also good for dealing with speed bumps. Of course, when you encounter a speed bump you should slow down, but in the event that you fail to do so leaf springs protect your vehicle from the shock more than a coil spring does. Plus, they provide more comfort for passengers and driver in this instance.\nIf you are tackling a lot of gravel roads, leaf springs are also the better choice. Since leaf springs sit in the rear of the vehicle, they can help absorb the up and down and side to side motions that gravel roads often produce. Leaf springs make this easier on the vehicle and also easier on the occupants.\nOn the other hand, if you do a lot of serious off-roading, coil springs are going to serve you better. Driving off-road means that your vehicle is going to be dealing with a lot of shock and overall abuse. Plus, your vehicle needs to be able to raise and lower in order to deal with severely uneven ground. Coil springs make riding on this sort of surface possible. Driving in such an environment would be very difficult with a leaf spring system.\nCoil springs are also good if you need a truck to haul a lot of heavy items like furniture. While a leaf spring suspension system can take a lot of weight, a coil spring system helps a truck carry a heavy load without sagging dangerously low. Additionally, when the back is empty, coil springs help provide the lift needed to keep the empty truck level.\nCoil springs also pull their weight if you need to drive on steep hills or heavy inclines. Since when you are on an extreme incline gravity is going to pull a lot of weight on the back of your truck, having a sturdy coil spring suspension system is invaluable. Particularly if you are carrying a heavy weight on strong inclines, a coil spring system is the better choice.\nAs you can see, even though there is a lot of debate surrounding a leaf spring suspension system versus a coil spring suspension system, both of them are Rife with pros and cons. Basically, leaf spring systems are much more common, due to their more flexible nature. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that coil springs are automatically inferior.\nWhich suspension system is best for your vehicle depends on the vehicle itself, where you drive it, and what you are doing with that vehicle.",

Remove the Wheel\n\nStart by breaking the lug nuts on the wheel, jacking up the vehicle, and setting it securely on a jack stand. Loosen or remove the lug nuts and the wheel.\n\n2. Remove the Air Filter Cover\n\nWorking from the top, remove the air filter cover by using a screwdriver to remove the three screws and move the air filter hose out of the way.\n\n3. Remove the Strut Assembly\n\nUse an 18-millimeter socket with an extension to loosen and remove the two top nuts on the strut assembly. Remove the two bolts holding the brake line in place with a 10-millimeter socket. Pop open the wheel speed sensor with a screwdriver and remove the sensor from the assembly. Use a 15-millimeter wrench and a 15-millimeter deep socket to remove the upper control arm, ball joint, and nut. Separate the upper control arm from the spindle and remove the top bolt from the strut assembly mounting bracket with an 18-millimeter breaker bar. Remove the lower mounting bracket nut with a 24 millimeter socket.\nYou may need to use a mallet to help pull the assembly and mounting bracket off the stud. Use a punch or separator to open the bracket enough to get the strut out. This may require some wiggling and hammering.\n\n4. Install the New Strut Assembly\n\nTake the new assembly and slide it into the bracket, leaving the separator inside. Remove the separator and hammer the bolt back into the bracket. Install the new strut with the strut arm bracket attached, slide the bottom of the bracket back onto the lower control arm stud under the hood, and install the two top strut mounting nuts. It\u2019s easier to tighten these with an extension.\n\n5. Reassemble the Suspension\n\nAttach the hose, install the air filter, and reinstall the cover. Install the bottom nut on the lower control arm stud, and install the nut on the bracket bolt clamping onto the strut assembly. Reattach the knuckle to the upper control arm, then install the upper control arm bolt and nut and tighten. Install the clips for the wheel speed sensor, and install the bolts connecting the brake line to the assembly. Put the wheel back on and tighten the lug nuts. Lower the car until the wheel is touching, then tighten the lug nuts to torque and lower the rest of the way. Repeat on the other side.\n\n6.

        "title": "How to Replace an Outer Tie End",
        "content": "HOW TO REPLACE AN OUTER TIE END\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and install wheel chocks. Wear appropriate gloves and safety goggles. Lift the car, place it on jack stands and remove the wheels for easy access.\n\n2. LOCATE THE OUTER TIE ROD END\n\nLocate the outer tie rod end. The ball with stud and locking nut attaches to the steering knuckle (spindle) next to the tire. If you have penetrating oil, it\u2019s a good practice to spray the jam nut and threads, along with the top castle nut with penetrating oil, as these are often very corroded. The outer tie rod will be connected on one side to the steering knuckle with a what is usually a castle nut and a cotter pin which keeps it from loosening. The other side of the tie rod is threaded, and connects to either an inner tie rod (on rack and pinion systems) or a center link, drag link, or adjusting sleeve, which any of these reside in more traditional steering systems, and some trucks still today. \n\n3. REMOVE THE TIE ROD\u2019S STUD NUT AND SEPARATE\n\nAs stated before, the tie rod connects to the steering knuckle of the car on each side with a tapered stud and nut. This nut is usually a castle-style nut with a cotter pin, but sometimes it is a Nylock nut. For a castle nut, remove the cotter pin. Many times these can be corroded and a pain to remove. Make sure to flood the nut down with penetrating oil. Next, remove the nut. You will now need a tie rod separator, otherwise known as a \u201cpickle-fork\u201d to dislodge the tapered stud from it\u2019s bore. You will insert the fork between the tie rod and knuckle, and hammer until the tie rod drops and separates. Sometimes, this process can take time, as many tie rods are very stubborn. \n\n4. LOOSEN THE JAM NUT (R&P TYPE) OR ADJUST SLEEVE NUT (CENTER LINK TYPE)\n\nfor R&P Type\nOne nice part with rack and pinion outer tie rods is that they often can be removed from the car without upsetting the alignment specs. The outer tie rod end threads onto the inner tie rod end and is held securely in place with a jam nut. Ensure the threads behind the nut are clean. Using a holding tool in one hand, secure the inner and outer tie rod ends while loosening the jam nut with a wrench in the other hand. Do not allow the \u2018loosening pressure\u2019 to put excessive pressure on the rack and pinion\u2019s inner tie rod. This may harm the gear or seal. Keep in mind, jam nuts will often loosen with either left or right hand threads, so sometimes turning the nut to the right will loosen it. Back the nut away and mark the position of the outer tie rod end with a small amount of paint. This will identify how far to thread the new tie rod end onto the inner tie rod. Now, you can unthread the tie rod end. Many times, you\u2019ll need a pair of locking pliers or wrench to turn the tie rod out. Once out, compare the lengths of your new tie rod to the old, and the mark you made showing exactly where the jam nut was threaded. You can then transfer this mark or location over to the new tie rod and check measurements from the mark to the center line of the tapered stud to be sure both marks are exactly the same.\nOR for Center Link Type\nThe outer tie rod end screws into the tie rod adjusting sleeve. Loosen the adjusting sleeve locking clamp and nut that holds the outer tie rod end. Do not loosen the inner tie rod locking nut. You will likely need to apply penetrant to the adjusting sleeve and outer tie rod end threads. Allow to soak while performing the next steps. Mark the tie rod end position with a small amount of paint. This will identify how far to thread the new tie rod end into the adjusting sleeve. Keep in mind that many tie rods have either left-hand or right hand threads, meaning you may be turning the tie rod to the right to loosen it. \n\n5. INSTALL THE NEW TIE ROD END\n\nThread the new tie rod end onto the inner tire rod end or into the tie rod adjusting sleeve. Position as close as possible to the original tie rods position. With the new rubber grease boot in place on the tie rod end, insert the threaded ball stud into the steering knuckle mounting hole. Install the locking nut and new cotter pin. Be sure and tighten the to the proper manufactures specification torque. This is important! If the nut loosens or the threads are damaged due to overtightening, the tie rod end could separate and cause an accident! So, be careful.\nNote: Some new tie rod ends use self-locking nuts that do not incorporate a cotter pin. Either design will work.\nNow, firmly tighten the jam nut or adjusting sleeve nut. Use both tools on the jam nut style just like beforehand to avoid damaging the R&P. If equipped, install the grease fitting. Use a grease lube gun and fill the new tie rod end with chassis lubricant. Do not over do it! Now is a good time to check and lubricate the other suspension and steering components.\n\n6. INSTALL WHEEL AND LUG NUTS\n\nInstall wheel and wheel nuts. Torque wheel nuts to owner manual specifications. Then, remove the tire jacks. Now is a good time to check the tire pressures.\n\n7. CHECK YOUR STEERING\n\nCheck the steering for smooth operation. The steering wheel should turn normally with no binding or catching. The steering wheel may be off \u2013 centered. This is due to the wheel alignment changes after the part installation.\n\n8. GET AN ALIGNMENT\n\nAs mentioned before, some tie rod changes can get you close enough to original location that an alignment isn\u2019t needed, but often it is, and regardless, it\u2019s always recommended. Normally, over time your vehicle\u2019s alignment will be out of spec anyways and should be tended to. To seek alignment help, or help with a tie rod change, check out our list of Preferred Shops in your area, and look closely for ones who specialize in alignment work as many shops do not do alignments. \n\n Pro Tip: \u00a0You have made changes to the steering of your car.\u00a0 This means your wheel alignment is not aligned correctly.\u00a0 Take the vehicle to a front end alignment shop before you drive any distances.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t, your vehicle will not steer correctly. \n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "Where is the Tire Pressure Sensor Located?",
        "content": "Introduction to Tire Pressure Sensors\n\nTire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) are now virtually standard in modern vehicles, playing a key role in preventing tire underinflation, which is a leading cause of tire failure. Proper tire pressure is not only incredibly important for your safety but also for achieving good fuel efficiency and prolonging the life of your tires.\nSensors operate on common radio frequency identifiers, or RFIDs, including 314.9Mhz, 315Mhz, and 433Mhz frequencies. These sensors continuously monitor the pressure inside your tires and alert you when the pressure falls below a certain threshold. This real-time information can be a lifesaver, enabling you to take action before a potentially hazardous situation arises.\n\nCommon Tire Pressure Sensor Locations\n\nTire pressure monitoring sensors come in two primary types: direct and indirect. Direct TPMS sensors are located within the tire assembly and directly measure the pressure in each tire, sending this information to the vehicle\u2019s computer. Most direct sensors are attached to the valve stem with the sensor portion inside the wheel. Other sensors are banded to the wheel inside. For direct sensors, you\u2019ll see an accurate pressure for each tire individually, usually displayed on your dash or an information center.\nOn the other hand, indirect TPMS sensors do not display tire pressure individually. Many use sensors inside the wheel and, when one of them is outside the threshold, it triggers the light, requiring you to check the tires yourself to know which one is low.\nA few indirect systems work with the vehicle\u2019s antilock braking system to compare the rotational speed of the tires and deduce pressure from these calculations. As such, they are not physically located in or on the tires themselves.\n\nIdentifying Your Vehicle\u2019s Tire Pressure Sensor\n\nWhen searching for the tire pressure sensor in passenger vehicles, you will most commonly find them mounted inside the wheels, as mentioned. You\u2019ll need the tire off the rim to see the sensor. You\u2019ll either see it:\n\nMounted on the valve stem \u2013 These sensors replace the traditional valve stems and communicate the tire\u2019s pressure to the onboard computer. About the size of a lighter, it\u2019s on the inside where the valve stem comes through the rim. Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Kia, and most other carmakers now use these types of sensors.\nSecured by a band \u2013 A strap within the wheel holding the sensor around the circumference is the other common design. Many Ford and Lincoln models used this type of sensor, although it\u2019s far less common now.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure where the sensors are located or how to service them, refer to your owner\u2019s manual or seek professional assistance. Vehicle manufacturers often have specific locations and recommendations for their makes and models, so knowing your vehicle\u2019s particular requirements is essential.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What are Wheel Spacers?",
        "content": "Introduction to Wheel Spacers\n\nWheel spacers are precisely engineered discs designed to create space between the wheel hub and the wheel itself. They are typically made of high-quality materials like aluminum or steel and come in various sizes and thicknesses. When mounted onto your vehicle\u2019s hub, they push the wheel away from the vehicle, effectively widening the wheelbase.\nThe primary purpose of wheel spacers is to increase the track width of your vehicle, providing several benefits, including improved handling, enhanced appearances, and the ability to accommodate larger tires or custom wheels.\n\nAdvantages of Using Wheel Spacers\n\nThere are three main advantages and scenarios for when you might want or need to have wheel spacers installed. If your situation matches these scenarios, a set of wheel spacers might be right for you.\n\nEnhanced Appearance\n\nOne of the most noticeable benefits of wheel spacers is the improvement in your vehicle\u2019s appearance. By pushing the wheels outwards, they create a more aggressive and appealing stance. The wider track width gives your vehicle a sportier, more planted look, which is highly sought after by car enthusiasts, and it\u2019s common for trucks, off-roaders, and even tuner cars.\n\nImproved Handling and Stability\n\nWheel spacers can positively impact your vehicle\u2019s handling and stability. By widening the track width, the vehicle\u2019s center of gravity is altered, providing better stability during turns and reducing the chances of rollovers. This is particularly advantageous for trucks and SUVs. Additionally, the wider stance can result in improved grip and traction, especially in high-performance or off-road applications.\n\nAccommodating Larger Tires\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever considered installing larger tires or aftermarket wheels, wheel spacers can be your best friend. They create extra space within the wheel well, allowing for larger and more aggressive tire and wheel combinations. This not only enhances the appearance but also contributes to better off-road performance and increased ground clearance. Without them, your turning radius might be reduced or the wheels might rub in the wheel wells or on the struts and shocks.\n\nConsiderations Before Installing Wheel Spacers\n\nBefore you rush to purchase and install wheel spacers, consider a few important factors to ensure a safe and successful outcome.\n\nVehicle compatibility \u2013 Not all vehicles are suited for wheel spacers. Do your research or consult an expert to determine whether your specific make and model can safely accommodate wheel spacers.\nSpacer size and material \u2013 Choosing the right spacer size and material is essential. The size of the spacer should fit your car\u2019s needs just enough to accommodate the results you want, and the material should be of high quality to withstand the forces and stresses involved in driving.\nBolt pattern and thread length \u2013 The spacer must have the correct bolt pattern to match your vehicle\u2019s hub and wheel. Additionally, ensure you have enough thread length on the wheel studs to securely fasten the wheel to the hub.\n\nWhile experienced enthusiasts may choose to install wheel spacers themselves, it\u2019s often best to have a professional mechanic do the job if you aren\u2019t confident doing it yourself. This ensures proper installation and minimizes the risk of issues down the road.\nCheck local laws and regulations regarding the use of wheel spacers. In some areas, certain modifications to your vehicle, including wheel spacers, may not comply with legal standards.\n\nHow to Install Wheel Spacers Safely\n\nIf you\u2019ve taken all the necessary precautions and decided to install wheel spacers, here\u2019s a basic guide to help you through the process. Remember, professional installation is highly recommended for safety and performance reasons.\n\nGather the Required Tools and Equipment\n\nYou\u2019ll need a jack, jack stands, lug wrench, torque wrench, wheel spacers, and the appropriate wheel bolts or nuts.\n\nElevate the Vehicle\n\nUse the jack to lift the vehicle off the ground, supporting it securely with jack stands. Set the parking brake for extra security.\n\nRemove the Wheels\n\nUsing the lug wrench, remove the wheels from your vehicle. It\u2019s often easier to loosen them a quarter turn before lifting the wheel off the ground.\n\nInstall the Wheel Spacers\n\nPlace the wheel spacers onto the vehicle\u2019s hub. Make sure they sit flush and are centered correctly. If they don\u2019t fit well, do not use them!\n\nReinstall the Wheels\n\nCarefully mount the wheels onto the wheel spacers and hand-tighten the lug nuts. Ensure the wheel spacer remains flush with both the hub and wheel surfaces.\n\nTorque the Lug Nuts\n\nUsing a torque wrench, tighten the lug nuts to the manufacturer\u2019s recommended specifications. It\u2019s essential to torque them properly to prevent any issues with the installation.\n\nLower the Vehicle\n\nRemove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground using the jack. After driving a short distance, double-check the torque on the lug nuts to ensure they are properly tightened.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How Long Do Tires Last?",
        "content": "Understanding the Lifespan of Tires\n\nThe lifespan of your tires is influenced by several key factors. These include driving habits, road conditions, weather, and the quality of your tires. Aggressive driving, frequent pothole encounters, and exposure to extreme weather can all accelerate tire wear.\nGenerally speaking, tires can last anywhere from 60,000 to 75,000 miles when the vehicle is properly maintained and driving conditions are optimal. It can be much shorter \u2013 20,000 miles or less \u2013 if the tires are low-quality, there are mechanical issues with the car, or the vehicle is driven hard.\nKnowing how to spot the signs of tire wear is crucial. Keep an eye out for uneven tread wear, cracks, bulges, and punctures. Regular inspections can help you catch issues early, ensuring your safety on the road.\n\nMileage vs. Age: Which Matters More?\n\nMany drivers wonder if tire age or mileage is a more significant factor in determining when to replace tires. While mileage is important, tire age is equally critical. Tires can degrade over time due to exposure to the elements, even if they have low mileage. Generally, most experts recommend replacing tires every six years, regardless of mileage, and each tire has its manufacture date code stamped on the sidewall.\n\nProlonging Tire Life: Maintenance and Care\n\nMaintaining the right tire pressure is crucial for extending tire life. Underinflated tires can wear out faster and reduce fuel efficiency. Check your tire pressure regularly and find the correct pressure for everyday driving on the sticker you\u2019ll see on the pillar when you open the driver\u2019s door. Never use the maximum inflation pressure marked on the tire.\nTire rotation is essential to ensure even wear. This should be done approximately every 6,000 to 8,000 miles, as recommended by your vehicle\u2019s manufacturer, or sooner if you notice abnormal wear. Rotating your tires extends their lifespan and enhances handling.\nProper wheel alignment is often overlooked, but it significantly impacts tire wear. Misaligned wheels can cause tires to wear unevenly and prematurely as they scrub against the road rather than rolling smoothly. It can indicate issues like worn tie rod ends. Regular alignment checks can save you money in the long run.\nSelecting the right tires for your vehicle and driving conditions is paramount. All-season or touring tires might be the best choice for those looking to maximize tire life, while performance tires may wear out more quickly. And while winter tires enhance traction immensely in cold, snowy conditions, they wear out extremely fast in temperatures above 45 F.\n\nTire Storage and Seasonal Considerations\n\nTire maintenance is key from season to season. Here are some tips and considerations:\n\nStore tires safely \u2013 If you need to store extra sets of tires, ensure they are stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This prevents premature aging and maintains the rubber\u2019s integrity.\nPerform seasonal tire swaps \u2013 Many drivers opt for seasonal tire swaps, using winter tires in cold months and all-season tires in warmer seasons. Proper storage and timely swaps can extend the life of both sets.\nKnow how extreme weather impacts tires \u2013 Extreme weather conditions, such as intense heat, cold, and heavy rain, can accelerate tire wear. Be mindful of these conditions and adjust your driving habits accordingly.\n\nWhen It\u2019s Time to Replace Tires\n\nMost tires come equipped with tread wear indicators, which are small bars within the tire grooves that become visible as the tread wears down. When these bars are level with the tread, it\u2019s time for a replacement.\nTire laws require a minimum tread depth to ensure safe driving. In the US, the legal minimum tread depth is typically 2/32 of an inch.

        "title": "How to Replace a Wheel on a Car",
        "content": "Importance of Wheel Replacement\n\nBefore diving into the practical aspects, let\u2019s understand why timely wheel replacement is crucial. Your car\u2019s wheels are not only responsible for carrying the weight of your vehicle but also for maintaining stability and steering control. Here are a few key reasons why you should replace a damaged or worn-out wheel.\n\nSafety. Damaged wheels can compromise your vehicle\u2019s stability, leading to hazardous driving conditions.\nTire health. A damaged wheel can also affect your tire\u2019s performance and lifespan, leading to uneven wear and tear.\nFuel efficiency. Misaligned wheels can result in increased fuel consumption due to added rolling resistance.\nHandling and comfort. Properly maintained wheels ensure smoother rides and better handling.\n\nTools and Materials Needed\n\nBefore you start replacing your car\u2019s wheel, it\u2019s essential to gather the necessary tools and materials.\n\nCar jack. To lift your car off the ground.\nLug wrench. For loosening and tightening lug nuts.\nSpare wheel. Ensure it\u2019s properly inflated and in good condition.\nWheel chocks. These prevent your car from rolling while you work on it.\nGloves and safety glasses. To protect your hands and eyes.\nOwner\u2019s manual. Always consult your car\u2019s manual for specific instructions.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Replacing a Car Wheel\n\nNow, let\u2019s walk through the process of replacing a car wheel step by step.\n\n1. Safely Park the Car and Gathering Tools\n\nFind a safe, level, and well-lit area to park your car. Turn on your hazard lights for added safety and apply the parking brake.\nPlace wheel chocks behind the tires to prevent rolling, then gather all the necessary tools and materials.\n\n2. Loosen Lug Nuts\n\nUse the lug wrench to gently loosen the lug nuts on the damaged wheel, but do not remove them completely just yet. Loosening the lug nuts while the car is still on the ground provides extra stability.\n\n3. Lift the Car Off the Ground\n\nLocate the designated jack points for your car, which you\u2019ll find in the owner\u2019s manual. Carefully position the car jack under one of these points. Slowly and steadily pump the jack until the car\u2019s wheel is off the ground, ensuring it\u2019s high enough to easily slide the new wheel underneath.\n\n4. Remove the Old Wheel\n\nOnce the car is securely lifted, use the lug wrench to fully remove the loosened lug nuts. Slide the damaged wheel off the wheel studs. If there\u2019s some corrosion, you may need to apply some force to the back of the wheel to get it free.\n\n5. Install the New Wheel\n\nPosition the spare or new wheel onto the wheel studs. Hand-tighten the lug nuts onto the studs to secure the wheel in place. Use the lug wrench to further tighten the lug nuts, but do not fully tighten them just yet.\n\n6. Tighten Lug Nuts in a Star Pattern\n\nTo ensure even pressure on the wheel, tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern. For five-lug wheels, tighten every other nut until you\u2019ve done all of them. For six-lug wheels, do the pairs that are straight across from each other. Gradually increase the torque on each nut until they are all snug.\n\n7. Lower the Car and Finalize the Installation\n\nSlowly lower the car using the jack until it\u2019s resting on the ground. Use the lug wrench to fully tighten the lug nuts in the same star pattern, ensuring they are properly torqued. Refer to your car\u2019s manual for specific torque values.\n\nTips for Proper Wheel Torqueing\n\nOver-tightening lug nuts can damage the wheel and studs, while under-tightening can lead to a loose wheel. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for torque values or you could have problems with a wheel coming loose while you drive, a vibration, or seized and broken wheel studs. Consider using a torque wrench for precise torque control.\n\nSafety Precautions and Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\nAlways prioritize safety by parking in a secure location, using wheel chocks, and wearing appropriate safety gear.\nNever work under a car supported only by a jack. Use jack stands for added safety.\nAvoid over-tightening or under-tightening lug nuts.\nDon\u2019t use damaged or worn-out lug nuts or studs.\n\nWhen to Seek Professional Help\n\nWhile changing a car wheel is a manageable task for many, there are situations where professional assistance is necessary.\n\nNo spare tire \u2013 If your car doesn\u2019t have a spare tire or the spare is also damaged.\nComplex issues \u2013 If you suspect more significant problems, such as a bent axle or damaged suspension components.\nLack of tools or experience \u2013 If you lack the necessary tools, experience, or confidence to safely replace a wheel.\n\nIn such cases, it\u2019s best to call roadside assistance or a mechanic to ensure your safety and your vehicle\u2019s health.

        "title": "How to Find a Slow Leak In a Tire",
        "content": "Signs and Symptoms of a Slow Leak\n\nThe most obvious symptom of a slow leak is that it\u2019s flat. After sitting for a few days \u2013 or even weeks \u2013 the tire will eventually lose all of its air pressure and be sitting on the rim. But that\u2019s not the only sign you may notice. Others include:\n\nA TPMS light on. This yellow indicator on your dash is shaped like a cross-section of a tire with an exclamation mark in the middle. It comes on when the pressure drops below the threshold registered in the car. Typically, it\u2019s a drop of around 5 PSI.\nYour car pulls to one side when driving. A low tire, especially on a front wheel, will cause more resistance and your car will pull to that side when you\u2019re driving.\nIt feels like your car is more sluggish. When the rolling resistance is high from a leaking tire, you may notice that it feels like your acceleration is slower.\nBouncy suspension. A slow leak leaves the tire softer, and that creates an uneven bounce when driving over potholes or bumps.\nThe tire looks low. Visibly, you may notice that a tire is lower than the others without being completely flat.\n\nNecessary Tools and Safety Precautions\n\nTo identify a slow leak, you\u2019ll need a few supplies and tools:\n\nA tire pressure gauge\nA spray bottle with a soap-and-water mixture\nA tire valve core tool\nStop leak for tires\nAir compressor\nA tub filled with water\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Finding a Slow Leak\n\nTo discover the cause of your leaking tire can take a bit of time, but it\u2019s not the most difficult process to complete. Here are the steps you can take to find the leak so you can repair it.\n\n1. Step 1: Inflate the tire\n\nAdd air to the normal operating pressure for your tire. Don\u2019t overfill it, as it can be dangerous to add excessive pressure to a tire.\n\n2. Step 2: Spray the tire\n\nSpray your tire with the soapy solution all over. It can be easier to check all around the tire if you remove the wheel from your car first, but it\u2019s not mandatory. Spray the tread area, the sidewall, the tire bead, and the valve stem. When the soapy water is applied to the area where the leak is coming from, you\u2019ll see it bubble. Since it\u2019s a slow leak, it can take a few seconds for bubbles to form.\n\n3. Step 3: Look for foreign objects\n\nYou might find a staple, a nail, a screw, or some other small piece of debris stuck in the tread. Remove the object from the tire, spray it, and see if it\u2019s your leak. You might find some things don\u2019t puncture all the way through the tire and don\u2019t leak.\n\n4. Step 4: Tighten the valve stem\n\nUsing your valve stem core tool, tighten the core to ensure it isn\u2019t the origin for the leak. It only needs to be snug, and make sure you don\u2019t over-tighten it.\n\n5. Step 5: Dunk the tire in a tub\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been successful detecting the leak with a soapy spray, then fill a large plastic container or bathtub with water and place the tire in it. All you need is the bottom part of the tire and rim submerged. Then, slowly turn the wheel and watch for bubbles to firm and rise to the surface.\n\n6. Step 6: Add stop leak\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been able to identify the leak precisely \u2013 or if the leak is in an unrepairable spot like the sidewall \u2013 you can add a tire stop leak product to hopefully help your tire retain air. This substance can ruin tire pressure sensors and make a huge mess that needs to be cleaned up the next time the tire comes off the rim, so it shouldn\u2019t be the first thing you reach for unless it\u2019s an emergency.\n\nPotential Drawbacks and Limitations\n\nIn some instances, a tire leak can be so minor that it\u2019s nearly impossible to identify. Taking your time and checking more than once can often help you discover the source so it can be repaired.\nAnother drawback can be for oversized tires. It can be tough to manipulate them, especially if you need to put them in a tub.\nPlus, some leaks can virtually close up unless the tire is in a certain position or is bearing weight on it.\nIt\u2019s important to find the source, though, as moisture entry into the tire\u2019s cords can cause them to corrode, leading to separation or premature failures in other ways.\n\nTips for Preventing Slow Leaks in Tires\n\nThe best way to prevent a slow leak in a tire is to avoid picking up a puncture, but that\u2019s easier said than done. Limit your exposure to driving conditions that can cause a leak, like driving in construction sites.\nAs well, replace tire valve stems every time you change the tires or remove it from the rim to fix it.",

        "title": "How to Use a Portable Tire Inflator",
        "content": "Introduction to Portable Tire Inflators\n\nBeing able to take care of vehicle servicing, especially in a problem that can disable your car, is something every driver should be capable of. A portable tire inflator helps you do it. It\u2019s a compact, lightweight air compressor that is designed to inflate your tires by pumping air into them.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to use an air compressor for tires, or if you don\u2019t own one or have access to one, a portable air pump can be useful in emergency situations, just to top up your tires seasonally, or to help someone else out as well.\n\nTypes of Portable Tire Inflators\n\nMainly, there are two types of portable tire inflators:\n\n12-volt tire inflators have an adapter that plugs into your car\u2019s power outlet or cigarette lighter. Some options also come with a pigtail that allows you to use alligator clips to attach it to a battery directly.\n\nBattery-powered tire inflators contain their own power source, so there\u2019s no need to connect it to your car\u2019s power. This makes them capable of operating as a power bank as well, or for inflating tires or tubes for bikes and other non-powered vehicles.\n\nThere are a wide range of features to look for also, including:\n\nA digital screen for easy pressure readings\nAdapters for different types of tire valves\nAutomatic stop when you\u2019ve reached your desired pressure\nA precision gauge-style tire gauge\nA light for roadside servicing in the dark\n\nSafety Precautions Before Using a Portable Tire Inflator\n\nIt can be convenient and time-saving to use a portable compressor, and it\u2019s simple to learn how to inflate car tires at home with these types of devices. But there can be issues to watch for.\n\nCheck the tire condition before inflating since a cut or bulge in the sidewall or tread can cause a blowout.\nLocate the right tire pressure on the sticker found on the driver\u2019s door pillar.\nAvoid over-inflating the tire, even if you know there\u2019s a leak and want a \u2018buffer\u2019 to get you where you need to go.\nUse it in a safe location where there\u2019s no danger of other vehicles hitting you, and make sure there are no combustible products nearby.\n\nAs well, never leave the inflator running unintended. If it doesn\u2019t stop when it\u2019s supposed to, you could unknowingly over-inflate the tire and cause it to blow out.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Using a Portable Tire Inflator\nPortable tire inflators are made to be simple to use, but you should always follow the instructions that came with your specific device. Follow these steps for an overview on how to use one safely.\n\nInspect the tire. Examine the tire for any visible damage, such as cuts, punctures, or bulges. Do not inflate a damaged tire.\nPower the inflator. Most portable tire inflators are either powered by a 12V outlet in your vehicle or a rechargeable battery. Connect the inflator to the appropriate power source.\nAttach the hose to your tire valve. Remove the valve cap from the tire valve stem and attach the valve connector from the inflator hose. Make sure the connection is secure and airtight.\nSet the desired pressure. If your inflator has a digital display or a pressure dial, set the desired tire pressure according to your vehicle\u2019s recommendation.\nStart the inflator. Turn on the inflator and allow it to run until the pressure you want is reached. Keep an eye on the pressure gauge to ensure accuracy, and avoid over-inflating the tire.\nStop the inflator. Once the desired pressure is reached, turn off the inflator and remove the hose\u00a0 from the tire valve stem.\nCheck the tire pressure. Use a tire pressure gauge you know to be good to confirm that the tire is inflated to the recommended pressure.\nRepeat for other tires. If necessary, repeat the process for the remaining tires, ensuring each tire is inflated to the recommended pressure.\n\nAfter inflating all the tires, disconnect the inflator from the power source and allow it to cool down before storing it.\n\nCommon Troubleshooting Issues and Solutions\n\nIf your inflator isn\u2019t working as you expect it to, it could be due to one of the following issues.\n\nNot enough power. A dead or dying car battery might not have enough power to operate a compressor. Either use a second vehicle to power it, or recharge your car battery before trying the inflator again.\nNot enough pressure. Some portable tire inflators have a limited inflation range, so they might not be capable of lowing up a tire on an RV, heavy-duty pickup, or other large vehicle. Check the inflators limits and find a new source if you need more air.\nShort air hose. If the air hose doesn\u2019t reach your tire easily, or if the tire valve is in an awkward position, you might need to use an extension or locate a longer hose to install on your inflator.\nIt overheats. These compact compressors aren\u2019t designed to run for long periods of time. After inflating each tire, pause for a few minutes to let the compressor cool down. Otherwise, it could fail prematurely.",

        "title": "Rack and Pinion Replacement Cost: What You Can Expect",
        "content": "What is a Rack and Pinion Steering System?\n\nWidely used in vehicles over the last five or six decades, the rack and pinion, also known as a steering gear or power steering rack, converts the rotational motion of the steering wheel into a linear, side-to-side motion to control the direction of the wheels.\n\nThe rack and pinion system consists of two main components:\n\nThe rack is a flat, toothed metal bar that runs horizontally, parallel to the front axle of the vehicle. It has gear teeth cut into its underside, which engage with the pinion gear.\nThe pinion is a small, round gear connected to the steering column and the steering wheel. When the driver turns the steering wheel, the pinion rotates, engaging with the teeth on the rack.\n\nAs the pinion rotates, it moves the rack left or right, depending on the direction the steering wheel is turned. This linear motion is transferred through the tie rods to the steering knuckles, changing the angle of the wheels and steering the vehicle.\nVirtually all vehicles use power-assisted rack and pinion systems that employ a hydraulic power steering pump or an electric motor. It provides additional force to reduce the effort required to turn the steering wheel, making it more comfortable and manageable to drive.\n\nSymptoms of a Failing Rack and Pinion\n\nThe steering rack is durable, and it\u2019s uncommon to replace it more than once or twice throughout the vehicle\u2019s lifetime. When it\u2019s failing, symptoms you might notice can include:\n\nIncreased steering effort. You may notice the steering becoming harder or heavier, especially at low speeds or when turning sharply.\nLoose or unresponsive steering. Excessive play in the steering wheel makes it feel loose or unresponsive to your input.\nUneven tire wear. A failing rack and pinion system can lead to misalignment, resulting in uneven tire wear.\nLeaking power steering fluid. Damaged seals within the rack and pinion unit can cause power steering fluid to leak which could lead to a loss of hydraulic pressure and reduced steering assistance.\nNoises while turning. Grinding, clicking, or whining noises when turning the steering wheel can indicate worn or damaged components.\nSteering wheel vibration. A failing rack and pinion system may cause vibrations or a droning feeling in the steering wheel.\nVehicle wandering. The car may tend to wander or pull to one side while driving, requiring constant steering correction.\n\nFactors that Affect the Cost of Rack and Pinion Replacement\n\nSeldom do two different models use the same rack and pinion, so pricing is bound to be different based on what you drive. Aside from the year, make, model, and other build criteria, there are several factors that will affect the cost of rack and pinion replacement.\nWhether you choose an OEM, a new aftermarket, or a remanufactured part will affect the pricing. OEM tends to be more expensive, and aftermarket or reman can be more affordable.\nIf you\u2019re having a mechanic do the job for you, the cost of labor can vary significantly based on their hourly rate, the shop you choose, the geographic location, and especially how complex the job is.\nAnd, it\u2019s not often that a steering rack is the only part that needs to be changed. There can be additional tie rods, bushings, hoses, and more that require replacement too, adding to the cost.\n\nAverage Cost of Rack and Pinion Replacement\n\nGenerally, a power steering rack and pinion replacement cost is an average of $560 for the parts alone, plus any incidentals. And on top of that, labor costs can range from $150 to more than $700, and you will also need a wheel alignment afterward.\nFor a common model, expect that you\u2019ll be in the vicinity of $950 to $1,100 between parts and labor. But how much does it cost to replace the rack and pinion if you do the work yourself and just need a wheel alignment after? You could potentially be in the neighborhood of $700.\u00a0\n\nTips to Save Money on Rack and Pinion Replacement\n\nIf you\u2019re into saving money on auto repairs, there are are few options to help you out.\nFirst, consider doing the job yourself if you have the technical knowledge or the drive to learn how to do it. It can save you hundreds of dollars, although it will take you longer to complete and you\u2019ll need a wide range of tools.\nSecond, consider a reman rack and pinion. They\u2019re competitively priced compared to new, and most options are still backed by a considerable warranty.\nThird, consider bundling repairs. If you need other steering or suspension work, it can save you on time and money by getting it done at the same time.",

        "title": "Tire Repair Kit Buying Guide 2023",
        "content": "Types of Tire Repair Kits\n\nWhat types of repair products are there for your average automotive tire? Three types of tire repair kits are widely available including:\n\nTire plug kits\nTire patch kits\nCombination plug-patch kits\nAnd sealant kits.\n\nA plug kit typically consists of rubber plugs, an insertion tool, and a reamer. The plugs are inserted into the hole in the tire and then trimmed off flush with the tread. Plugging a tire can help prevent further damage to the tire and they install quickly without dismounting the tire, but there are always limitations. They\u2019re only good on holes about 1/8-inch or less in diameter, and there\u2019s a chance they can get pushed out as you drive.\nA patch kit consists of flat patches that are applied to the inside of the tire on the liner. They include an abrasive tool, adhesive, and rubber patches. They\u2019re usually more durable than plugs alone since they\u2019re applied inside with rubber cement that\u2019s cured, but you need to have the equipment to dismount and remount the tire and reinflate it. It also takes quite a bit longer to do.\nSealant kits are normally a pressurized can of liquid adhesive that\u2019s pushed into the tire through the valve stem. It coats the liner and seals holes from the inside, and they\u2019re fast to use. However, sealant leaves a sticky mess inside the tire that needs to be cleaned up for a permanent repair, and it can destroy valve stems and tire pressure sensors. They\u2019re great for emergencies, though.\nThe only DOT-approved tire repair kit, though, is one that includes a combination plug-patch. It fills the void in the tire tread while permanently patching it from the inside. It takes the longest to complete, naturally, but the tire is considered roadworthy afterward.\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Tire Repair Kit\n\nWhat should you look for in a tire repair kit? These criteria can help you make the best choice.\n\nThe type of puncture. If the hole is small like a staple or a small-gauge screw, a patch or plug can suffice. A cut in the tire may require something like a plug or plug-patch to fill the void.\nEase of use. If you don\u2019t have access to shop equipment to remove, install, and balance a tire, then a plug from the outside or a tire sealant kit might be the right choice.\nDurability. The best, longest-lasting option is a combination plug-patch. Aside from that, the best option is a patch from the inside when it comes to lasting.\nCost. While none of the options are overly expensive, many kits come with enough plugs for multiple repairs if needed. Sealant is costlier since each can is one-time use.\n\nLastly, only use sealant as a last-ditch effort. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll need to replace the tire if you use it, or you may need a new TPMS sensor, valve stem, and an expensive rim cleaning too.\u00a0\n\nRecommended Tire Repair Kit products\n\nSlime Patches with Glue, Scuffer Box Kit 56 Piece\n\nWhen you\u2019re in need of a tire patch, this kit has enough to fix tires many, many times over. The Slime Patches Kit includes 56 patches of various sizes, two tubes of adhesive to ensure it sticks, and the abrasive pad to rough up and clean the surface first. They\u2019re not a DOT-approved solution, and you\u2019ll need to have the tools and patience to pull the tire from the rim to use them.\n\nX-tra Seal Large Plug Patch\n\nWhen you want to fix a fair-sized hole permanently, these X-tra Seal Large Plug Patches are a go-to solution. It comes 15 to a package so you\u2019ll be well-stocked for at least a few years, and they have a spiky sheath to push the plug through the puncture. They can be used anywhere on the flat tread section, but avoid the shoulder and sidewall. Like a basic patch, they need to be installed from the inside.\n\nX-tra Seal Large Plug Patch\n\nBuy Now \n\nX-tra Seal Radial Repair Oval Patch\n\nWhen the leak is from a slice or larger hole, you need a larger patch that\u2019s able to withstand some miles of driving if necessary.

        "title": "How to Rotate Your Tires",
        "content": "Importance of Tire Rotation\n\nOne of the most important reasons for rotating your vehicle\u2019s tires is to extend their lifespan, thus saving you money on replacements before absolutely necessary. Along with that very valid point, other reasons to switch them around include:\n\nPromoting even tire wear. Tires on the front axle of a vehicle often wear quicker than the tires on the rear axle due to factors such as braking, steering, and vehicle weight. Rotating the tires helps to even out tire wear and prolong their useful life.\nMaintaining handling. Uneven tire wear can cause handling issues like pulling to one side, vibrations, and decreased stability, all of which can be corrected by regular tire rotation.\nIncreasing safety. Worn tires lead to decreased traction, increased stopping distances, and reduced handling, which all pose a safety risk. Regular tire rotations help keep wear even and tires in good condition, which improves overall vehicle safety.\n\nIf you know how to rotate tires, you can save yourself some money on maintenance and have a better understanding of your vehicle\u2019s condition. Continue reading to learn more about why a tire rotation is important and how to do it properly.\nIf you know how to rotate tires, you can save yourself some money on maintenance and have a better understanding of your vehicle\u2019s condition. Continue reading to learn more about why a tire rotation is important and how to do it properly.\n\nWhen to Rotate Your Tires\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how often to rotate tires, it\u2019s generally recommended every 5,000 to 7,500 miles, or every six months to a year, whichever comes first. However, the specific mileage interval may vary depending on your driving habits, the type of vehicle you drive, and the type of tires you have.\nCheck your owner\u2019s manual to determine the best interval to rotate your tires. Some signs that it may be time to rotate your tires include uneven tire wear, steering wheel vibration, and handling or traction that\u2019s not up to par. As well, it\u2019s a good idea to rotate your tires before long road trips or after any major service or repair that involves the tires, steering, or suspension.\n\nTools Needed for Tire Rotation\n\nTo rotate your tires, you will need the following tools:\n\nJack and jack stands\nLug wrench or impact wrench\nTorque wrench or torque stick\nWheel chocks\nTire pressure gauge\nTire Marker or tire crayon to label the tires\n\nYou\u2019ll also need the wheel lock key if you have wheel locks.\n\nHow to Rotate Your Tires: Step-by-Step Guide\n\nIf you\u2019re adept at using your garage\u2019s tools, it\u2019s possible to rotate your tires in as little as 15 minutes. Plan for a bit more time than that, and if it\u2019s your first time, it could take you closer to an hour. Don\u2019t rush it \u2013 a job done right is better than finishing hastily and having problems later.\n\n1. Prepare Your Vehicle\n\nYour vehicle needs to be parked on a flat, level surface to lift it safely. Once it\u2019s parked, engage the parking brake and chock the wheels to prevent it from rolling.\n\n2. Loosen the Lug Nuts\n\nIt\u2019s much more difficult to loosen lug nuts when the wheel is in the air and free to spin. Using your lug wrench, crack each lug nut loose. All you need is a quarter turn to ensure you can get them off when the vehicle is lifted, and do not remove any lug nuts at this point. If you have wheel locks, you\u2019ll need the key at this step to begin loosening that nut too.\n\n3. Lift the Vehicle\n\nLocate your vehicle lift points in your owner\u2019s manual. Then, lift the wheels off the ground one by one, placing a jack stand under the lift point to secure it. It\u2019s easiest to lift all four wheels off the ground at once, but you can do the job one side at a time \u2013 left or right.\n\n4. Remove the Wheels\n\nWith the wheels in the air, remove them using your lug wrench or an impact wrench. Remove the wheel \u2013 you may need to mule kick it to break it loose if it\u2019s holding firmly. Mark the position each tire came off of on the tire tread (LF, RF, RR, LR) so you can identify where to install them in the next step.\nPro tip: use small containers or cans to keep the lug nuts together for each wheel so you aren\u2019t chasing them around your garage floor.\n\n5. Rotate the Tires\n\nWith the wheels off, move them to their new location. Not sure where they should be rotated to? We\u2019ll discuss the tire rotation patterns shortly.\n\n6. Reinstall the Wheels\n\nLift the wheel onto the wheel studs and start the lug nuts by hand. Then, after ensuring the wheel is centered on the studs or hub, tighten them in a criss-cross pattern until snug. You\u2019ll finish tightening them soon.\n\n7. Lower the Vehicle\n\nWith all four wheels back on, carefully lift your car off of the jack stands and lower it to the ground.\n\n8. Tighten the Lug Nuts\n\nIn a criss-cross pattern again, tighten the lug nuts to the correct torque spec for your vehicle, which you can find in your maintenance manual. Normally, it\u2019s around 80 lb.-ft. for steel wheels and 100 lb.-ft. for aluminum or alloy wheels.\n\nDifferent Tire Rotation Patterns\n\nThere\u2019s a debate as old as time about the right pattern for a tire rotation, and it\u2019s not fully solved. Just choose one that seems best for your needs and go with it. Options include:\n\nFront-to-back. This is the simplest rotation pattern and involves moving the front tires straight back and the rear tires straight up to the front. It\u2019s the only pattern that should be used for directional tires as well.\nX-pattern. Also known as a cross-rotation, this pattern involves moving the front tires diagonally back to the opposite rear position and the rear tires diagonally forward to the opposite front position. It\u2019s the right pattern for vehicles with full-time 4WD.\nSide-to-side. This pattern is used for vehicles with non-directional tires of the same size on all four wheels. The front tires are moved straight back to the opposite side, while the rear tires are moved forward and across to the opposite side, creating an \u201cX\u201d.\n\nTips and Precautions for Tire Rotation\n\nAlways refer to your vehicle maintenance guide for the proper torque spec to use on the lug nuts, and ensure they\u2019re tight before attempting to drive your vehicle. While you\u2019re rotating the tires, take the time to inspect for cuts, tread depth, uneven wear, and even suspension, steering, and brake conditions.\nOnce you\u2019ve rotated your tires, take a test drive to ensure you don\u2019t have a pull to either side. If you do, double check the wheel nut torque and get your wheel alignment inspected.\nAnd finally, re-torque your wheels after driving 60 miles.",

        "title": "How to Replace a Sway Bar Link",
        "content": "Tools and Parts Needed for the Job\n\nA sway bar link is a short section of steel or reinforced aluminum that\u2019s connected at either end to the control arm or the strut and the sway bar. Changing it doesn\u2019t take much for equipment, but you\u2019ll need a few things to ensure it\u2019s going to go well. You\u2019ll need:\n\nA floor jack and jack stands\nLug nut wrench\nPenetrating fluid\nA wrench set\nA ratchet and socket set\nVice grips or pliers\nGloves and eye protection\nA new sway bar link\nTorque wrench\n\nIf the sway bar link is broken, stripped, or seized, you might also need a cut-off wheel on a disc grinder or angle grinder.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Replacing a Sway Bar Link\n\nWith your tools and parts collected, you\u2019re ready to get going. Here are the steps to change the link.\n\n1. Raise the Vehicle\n\nPark your vehicle on a smooth, level surface if possible. Then lift the wheel off the ground where you\u2019re changing the sway bar link using the floor jack. It\u2019s not considered safe to work on your vehicle with only the floor jack holding it since it could move or fall, so secure your vehicle on a jack stand.\n\n2. Locate the Sway Bar Link\n\nThe sway bar link is pretty easy to identify if you already have the new part in hand. There are a few different styles, and yours might be fastened by a straight stud and nut or it could be a small ball joint. To see it clearly and make room to work, it\u2019s best to remove the wheel. Use the lug nut wrench to pull it off.\n\n3. Remove the Old Sway Bar Link\n\nRemoving the sway bar link is the toughest part of the process. And even so, you shouldn\u2019t need too long to figure it out. Begin by spraying the fasteners at both ends of the link with penetrating fluid, then let it sit for at least five minutes to let it work.\nThe link or the ball and socket is likely to spin when you try to loosen it. Clamp a pair of vice grips onto the link securely, or on the ball and socket to stop it from spinning. On some vehicles, there might be a notch where a wrench fits instead. Then, use your ratchet and socket to begin loosening the nut on one end. Then, repeat the process on the other end.\nIf you can\u2019t prevent the link or joint from spinning, no matter how much you try, you may need to cut the link free. Your cutting wheel can get in close to do it, but be sure you don\u2019t contact any other parts like brake lines, calipers, or CV joints.\n\n4. Install the New Sway Bar Link\n\nWith the old link off, you\u2019re free to put the new link in. There will be two fasteners, just like the old one. Position the new link and start the nuts on the ends of the link, then tighten them down. Use a torque wrench to finish the job, ensuring they\u2019re tightened to at least 14 lb. ft.\n\n5. Test the Link\n\nNext, ensure the link is tight. Start by firmly grasping the link and trying to move it vertically and laterally. There shouldn\u2019t be any play or noises. If is, either the link isn\u2019t tight or mounting holes are oblonged and there are additional parts you\u2019ll need to replace.\nThen, take a road test and listen for noises. A good installation will eliminate any clunking or rattling from the\u00a0 sway bar link when you\u2019re going over uneven surfaces.\n\nTips for a Successful Replacement\n\nGetting the job done right isn\u2019t very hard, but there are a few tips that can help the job go even better.\u00a0\n\nHave a second person available to help you.\nCompare the old and new links before removing the old ones, confirming you have the right ones.\u00a0\nWhen you don\u2019t have room to cut a link off, apply heat with a propane torch.\nA seized nut can be cut crosswise and hammered open with a screwdriver sometimes.\nCheck that the sway bar bushings are in good shape, and replace them if they are cracked or worn.",

        "title": "How to Align Your Car",
        "content": "What is Wheel Alignment?\n\nA car alignment ensures that all four of a vehicle\u2019s tires are pointing in the same direction and are at the correct angles. It consists of three angles:\n\nCamber indicates the inward or outward tilt of the wheels relative to the road surface. The ideal camber reading for most vehicles should be close to zero, indicating a vertical orientation relative to the road surface. Most cars are within one degree of vertical and usually as negative camber to improve handling.\nCaster is an angle measurement in a wheel alignment that indicates the forward or backward tilt of the steering axis when viewed from the side. The ideal caster angle is always positive, meaning the position of the wheel is shifted forward of a vertical axis.\nToe is an angle measurement in a wheel alignment that indicates the inward or outward tilt of the front and rear wheels when viewed from above. This is the most common angle that needs to be addressed, and it\u2019s also the part of a wheel alignment that we\u2019ll deal with in this article.\n\nWhy Is Wheel Alignment Important?\n\nNot only does wheel alignment improve the handling quality and ride comfort of your car, it also helps maintain its safety by ensuring that all the wheels on your car are pointed in the right direction, otherwise they end up fighting against each other.\nIf the camber is too positive (the top of the tire is tilted outward), it can cause excessive tire wear on the outside of the tread. If it is too negative (the top of the tire is tilted inward), it can cause excessive wear on the inside tread.\nIf the caster angle is too positive (tilted backward), it can cause instability when driving at higher speeds or taking turns. If it is too negative (tilted forward), it can cause an overly sensitive steering experience and make it harder to keep your vehicle in a straight line.\nIf the toe is too positive (the wheels are pointed outward), it can cause premature tire wear and instability when turning. If it is too negative (the wheels are pointed inward), it can cause excessive tire wear on the inside tread and make it hard to keep your car moving straight.\n\nSigns Your Car Needs an Alignment\n\nRegularly driving over bumps or potholes, running over curbs, and hitting uneven surfaces are all common occurrences in your day-to-day life. Unfortunately, over time these incidences take a toll on the condition of your vehicle\u2019s wheels and tires, often leading to various alignment issues.\nWhen this happens, symptoms will show up that indicate your car needs an alignment such as:\n\nUnusual tire wear patterns like feathering\nWorn suspension components\nVibrations that increase at higher speeds\nPulling left or right when at highway speed\nA tight or loose steering sensation\nSquealing tires\nA steering wheel that\u2019s off center\n\nTo get the best performance out of your vehicle and keep you safe while driving, wheel alignment should be checked at least every 12,000 miles or whenever any major service or repair was done on your car\u2019s suspension or steering system.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide on How to Align Your Car\n\nA wheel alignment is a job that needs to be done every couple of years, even if your vehicle isn\u2019t showing any signs of poor handling. Since it requires adjustments that are very precise, it\u2019s recommended to have a professional mechanic do it for you, especially for camber and caster. However, you might be able to align the toe angle on the front wheels pretty well after replacing steering or suspension parts like a tie rod end or struts.\nTo align your car, follow these steps:\n\n1. Park your car on a level surface\n\nPark on a flat, even surface like a level garage floor. Set the steering wheel straight and secure it. Then, bounce the car\u2019s suspension a few times to settle it.\n\n2. Mark a reference on the tires\n\nUsing a wax pencil or a marker, measure four inches up at the front and rear side of each front tire on the outer sidewall. This mark will be used to ensure you\u2019re working as accurately as possible.\n\n3. Measure the distances between the tires\n\nPlace something flat like a level across the two marks on the tire on one side and have a friend do the same on the other. Then, measure a measuring tape or length of string stretched up to your flat bar on the rear side of the front tires and the front side as well. Compare the measurements. A very slight toe-in angle is normal where the front side is slightly narrower than the rear.\n\n4. Adjust the toe angle\n\nIf the toe is far from zero, whether that\u2019s toe-in or toe-out, it needs to be adjusted. Loosen the jam nuts on the adjuster sleeve for each tie rod end and use a wrench to move the adjuster narrower or wider. Bounce the vehicle a few times and re-measure. Adjust until the measurement is within about 1/8th of an inch narrower in the front than the rear of the tires.\n\n5. Tighten the Jam Nuts\n\nTighten the jam nuts and test drive your car to determine if the steering feels good and your car handles well. Then, make an appointment to get a complete wheel alignment done at your preferred shop.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "How to Check Tire Pressure",
        "content": "What\u2019s the right tire pressure for my car?\u00a0\n\nEvery passenger vehicle has a recommended tire pressure according to the manufacturer that you should keep to. One place you can find it is in the owner\u2019s manual or the online literature for your vehicle, always making sure to choose the right year, make, model, and tire options for an accurate pressure.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll also find the correct pressure on the driver\u2019s door placard or sticker along with other VIN-specific information like the date of manufacture and the paint code.\u00a0\nA word of caution: DO NOT fill the tire to the pressure rating marked on the side of the tire. That\u2019s the maximum pressure the tire can withstand, not the operating pressure. Filling tires to the maximum PSI will result in a very stiff ride, excessive tire wear, and the potential for a blowout.\u00a0\n\nSteps to check tire pressure\u00a0\n\nMany vehicles today have a TPMS system that notifies the driver of a low tire pressure, and some also indicate the current pressure at each tire. If your vehicle has such a system, scroll through your driver information center settings until you see these pressures on the screen. The system will flag any tire that\u2019s out of its normal pressure rating. It\u2019s still best to check the tires with a tire pressure gauge since they might not be registered in the correct position.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you follow this simple procedure, you can check your tire pressure at all four wheels in just a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Gather the necessary tools \n\nTo check and adjust tire pressures, you\u2019ll need only a few things:\n\nAn air supply like a portable air compressor\n\nAn air chuck\n\nA tire pressure gauge\n\nIf you\u2019re checking your tires at a service station, it might already be equipped with all of these things.\n\n2. Find the recommended tire pressure\n\nOpen the driver\u2019s door and check the label stuck to either the door or the pillar. It will indicate the recommended tire pressure, including the spare tire. On older cars, you might find this label inside the glove box instead.\n\n3. Locate the valve stem on each tire\n\nThe valve stem is a rubber or metal tube extending from the rim, facing outward. Normally, it\u2019s a couple of inches long, but some larger trucks have valve stems that can be much longer. This is where you\u2019ll be connecting the air hose to add or lower the pressure.\n\n4. Remove the cap from the valve stem\n\nA plastic or aluminum cap is threaded over the end of the valve stem to protect it from corrosion, moisture, and debris. Turn the valve stem cap counterclockwise to remove it from the valve stem. If it\u2019s stuck, use a pair of pliers to gently twist it free. If it breaks, you\u2019ll need to get a tire repair shop to replace the valve stem.\n\n5. Attach the tire pressure gauge to the valve stem\n\nTire pressure gauges quickly read the air pressure inside the tire. Press the end of the gauge against the valve stem completely flush. If it\u2019s even slightly crooked, you\u2019ll hear air hissing past. If that\u2019s happening, move the tire pressure gauge until the air stops leaking by.\n\n6. Take a pressure reading\n\nAs you press the tire pressure gauge in place, notice the maximum pressure it reads. On stick-style and dial-style gauges, they often reset to 0 as soon as they\u2019re released. On digital gauges, the pressure can sometimes remain on the display for a few seconds or until it\u2019s cleared.\n\n7. Add or release air as needed\n\nAdjust the air pressure to the recommended pressure you found earlier. The air chuck on your compressor will be one of two styles, normally. The first simply presses squarely against the end of the valve stem, and air transfers from the compressor to the tire to inflate it. The second style has a spring clip and, after pressing in the clip, the hose end is placed over the valve stem end. Air can then be added without holding the hose in place.\nRepeat the process for each tire.\n\n8. Replace the valve stem caps\n\nDon\u2019t forget to re-install the valve stem caps to keep the valve clean and free of dust and dirt.\n\nIf you find one tire needs air added consistently, it could mean there\u2019s a puncture or leak at the valve stem, and you\u2019ll need to get it fixed. If the tire pressures rise and fall at the same rate, it\u2019s due to weather fluctuations and shouldn\u2019t be cause for concern.",

        "title": "How to Check Tire Tread Depth",
        "content": "Why Tread Depth is Important\u00a0\n\nThe difference in handling between new tires and only 2/32nds of an inch of tread remaining can be significant. New tires have a full depth of tread, often between 8/32nds and 12/32nds, which provides excellent traction and grip on the road. This means that they will handle better in wet or slippery conditions, and will have better braking performance.\u00a0\nTires with 2/32nds of tread, on the other hand, have reduced traction and grip on the road, especially in wet or slippery conditions. Braking performance is affected as the tires will can\u2019t displace as much water as new tires, leading to longer stopping distances. Tires with less tread will also generate more heat which can lead to increased wear and tear on the tires, and potentially even cause a blowout.\u00a0\nThe reduced handling and traction of worn tires also increase the risk of hydroplaning because the channels between the tread blocks as well as the sipes are much smaller. Water or snow gets trapped between the tire and the ground, creating a slippery barrier that prevents contact.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to have tires with enough tread depth to ensure the vehicle\u2019s safety on the road. That\u2019s why it\u2019s recommended to replace tires when the tread depth reaches 4/32nds of an inch. They\u2019re completely worn out when there\u2019s just 2/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining or when the tread wear indicator is visible.\u00a0\n\nHow to Measure Tire Tread Depth\u00a0\n\nThere are a few common and free or inexpensive methods for checking how much tread depth remains. Two of the three tests only involve pocket change.\u00a0\n\n1. Perform the Penny Test\n\nThe penny test is a simple and easy method to check the tread depth of your tires to determine if your tires need to be replaced or if they are still safe to drive on. The test is done by inserting a penny between the tread blocks.\nTo perform the penny test, start by finding the tread wear indicator on your tires. These are small raised bumps that are located in the grooves of the tread. They are usually located at the base of the tread and are designed to let you know when your tires are worn down to the minimum legal limit.\nOnce you have located the tread wear indicator, take a penny and insert it into the groove of the tread with Lincoln\u2019s head facing down. If the top of Lincoln\u2019s head is visible, then your tread depth is less than 2/32 of an inch, which means it\u2019s time to replace your tires. If the top of Lincoln\u2019s head is not visible, then your tread depth is greater than 2/32 of an inch, and your tires would likely pass a state inspection.\nThe penny test should be done on multiple locations of the tire, both in the center and at the edges, as the tread depth can vary across the tire.\n\n2. Perform the Quarter Test\n\nThe quarter test is another simple and easy method to check tread depth. Similar to the penny test, it is a quick way to determine if your tires need to be replaced or if they are still safe to drive on using a quarter.\nTo perform the quarter test, take a quarter and insert it into the groove of the tread with George Washington\u2019s head facing down. If the top of George Washington\u2019s head is visible, then your tread depth is less than 4/32 of an inch, which means it\u2019s time to replace your tires. If the top of George Washington\u2019s head is not visible, then your tread depth is greater than 4/32 of an inch and your tires are safe to drive on.\n\n3. Use a Tread Depth Gauge\n\nTread depth gauges are a cost-effective tool for measuring the remaining tread depth. They\u2019re usually equipped with measurements in both fractions of an inch or millimeters, whichever you prefer. A t-shaped frame has a small measuring stick like a caliper that can be extended for extremely accurate measurements, and it\u2019s the best way to check tread on all tires, especially newer ones with plenty of depth remaining.\nPlace the flat section against the tread, spanning two tread blocks, then press the stick downward until it presses against the tire. Read the measurement and repeat in several spots around the tire.",

        "title": "Plugging a Tire vs Patching a Tire: Which Repair is Better?",
        "content": "How Tire Plugs Work\n\nTire plugs are a fast and easy repair kit to use that does exactly like the name suggests: they plug the hole in the tire. The plugs are flexible, tacky rubber strings that can seal up small holes in your tire left behind by a screw, nail, or something else thin and pointy. The kit also includes a reamer tool with raspy edges that cleans and roughs up the hole before inserting the plug, and a tool to insert the plug itself.\nOnce you locate the hole in your tire, you\u2019ll jam the reamer tool into it and push and pull a few times, cleaning any debris and corrosion out. Next, you insert a rubber string into the eye on the plugging tool, apply adhesive if your kit includes it, then push it about two-thirds of the way into the tire. A quick pull back on the tool will leave the plug in place, and then you simply trim it flush with the tread.\n\nWhen Should a Tire Plug Be Used?\n\nTire plugs are a temporary solution if you\u2019re using them on a vehicle driven on the roads. The necessary process of reaming the hole effectively cuts tire cords and can affect the tire\u2019s structure.\n\nUse a tire plug when:\n\nYou\u2019re able to get to the tire shop soon for a permanent repair\nIt\u2019s for an offroad vehicle, wheelbarrow, or another type of tubeless tire\nThe puncture is in the tread section\nThe hole is less than 1/8\u201d wide\nYou\u2019re planning to replace your tires soon anyway\n\nHow Long Does a Tire Plug Last?\n\nA tire plug could be just fine for a day, a week, a year, or even longer. Done properly, it can effectively seal the tire and let you keep using it, but there\u2019s no guarantee it\u2019s going to last. Some sources say a properly plugged tire can be driven on for 25,000 miles, although that\u2019s not recommended since determining if a plug has been put in correctly is extremely difficult without taking the tire off the rim.\n\nHow Tire Patches Work\n\nTo patch a tire is more involved than jamming a plug in the tire. Patches are thin, flexible pieces of rubber that are affixed to the inner liner of a tubeless tire with an adhesive like rubber cement.\nWith a tire patch vs plug, you\u2019ll need to take the wheel off and dismount the tire from the rim to access the inner liner. Of course, that also means you\u2019ll need to reseat the bead and inflate the tire afterward. With the tire off the rim, the puncture wound is scuffed to promote adhesion and rubber cement is applied to both the patch and the cleaned area. Once it\u2019s dried to the touch,\u00a0 the patch is applied and pressed into place to seal it.\n\nTire Patch Kit\n\nBuy Now \n\nWhen Should You Use a Tire Patch?\n\nTire patches are more durable than a plug in most cases. They\u2019re less convenient and don\u2019t work well in an emergency situation, like if you\u2019re stuck at the roadside with a flat.\nTire patches are great when:\n\nYou have the time and equipment to do the job\nThe puncture is in the flat tread section\nThere are no other punctures or repairs it will overlap with\nThe tire won\u2019t be used permanently on your vehicle\nThe puncture is less than \u00bc\u201d wide\nIt\u2019s for an off-road vehicle\n\nHow Long Does a Tire Patch Last?\n\nA tire patch can last indefinitely, or it could come off unexpectedly. With only one small layer of protection against the leak, there\u2019s no promise of its longevity. Properly installed, you could drive on a patched tire for years but it shouldn\u2019t be considered a permanent repair.\n\nWhich Tire Repair is Better?\n\nIn the comparison between a tire patch vs plug, a tire patch is a more dependable solution if you have the time and equipment to install it. If you\u2019re in a pinch, a tire plug will suffice as long as the hole isn\u2019t too large for the plug to fit tightly.\n\nTire plug vs patch cost\n\nIf you\u2019re doing it yourself, the pricing is quite modest for the two options. A tire patch kit is only a few dollars and will suffice for a handful of repairs, whereas a tire plugger kit is more expensive with tools included in it, probably around $10 to $35, and comes with enough plugs for a handful of repairs too.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Best Repair?\n\nIf you have a puncture in a tire, the only surefire way to confirm it hasn\u2019t compromised the cords or belts is to replace the tire completely. The next best solution is a combination plug-patch, which is the only repair approved by the tire industry for use on the highway. And if you\u2019re going to go through the effort of a patch, a plug patch is only a small cost more for virtually the same job.\n\nWhen Can\u2019t a Tire Be Repaired?\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t attempt to repair on some punctures at all. If the hole is larger than \u00bc\u201d or it\u2019s entered into an area on the shoulder or sidewall of the tire, the tire needs to be replaced rather than fixed. Punctures in the sidewall or on the shoulder flex too much for a patch or plug to hole properly, and you can expect it to leak right away. As well, the sidewall is thinner and could blow out at the repair.\n\nFAQs",

        "title": "How to Plug a Tire",
        "content": "What tools do you need to plug a tire?\n\nDriver\u2019s often ask, \u201cCan I plug a tire myself?\u201d Of course, you can. It might be intimidating to perform a repair on your vehicle, but a tire repair isn\u2019t nearly as intrusive as it may appear. To find and repair the leak, you\u2019ll need:\n\nA spray bottle with soapy water\nTire chalk or a marker\nA tire plug kit including a reamer, probe, and plugs\nTire inflator\nA car jack\nTire wrench\nPliers\nSide cutters\n\nOptionally, the tire can be repaired using a combination plug-patch or patch and rubber cement. For that, you\u2019ll need tire dismount bars to remove the tire from the rim.\u00a0\n\nSteps to Repair a Tire\n\nAccording to the Tire Industry Association, an approved repair requires that the tire is taken off the rim, inspected, and plugged and patched from the inside. That might take more time than you have in the moment., and we\u2019ll review that too. But if you need to perform an emergency or temporary repair, a tire plug can do the job. Here\u2019s how to do it.\u00a0\n\nRemove the Tire\n\nIn a safe place, park on a flat surface with the parking brake set. Use your tire wrench to loosen each lug nut about a quarter-turn, then jack up the affected wheel. Ensure there\u2019s enough clearance so the tire is not contacting the ground anymore. Once the tire is off the ground, remove the pre-loosened lug nuts with the tire wrench and pull the wheel assembly off the car.\n\nLocate the Leak\n\nNow, to locate the source of the leak\u2026 Sometimes, punctures are evident like a screw in the middle of the tread. Other times, you\u2019ll have no idea where it\u2019s coming from, even with a thorough check over. To find the source of the leak, inflate the tire and spray it with soapy water. The leak will begin to blow bubbles in the viscous liquid, identifying where the problem is. Mark the hole with a piece of tire chalk or something else that stands out on the rubber.\n\nHow to Plug Your Tire\n\nThe technical part isn\u2019t all that difficult. To install a tire plug, follow these steps:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n1. Ream the Hole\n\nPush the reaming tool into the puncture, moving it in and out a few times. This cleans any debris from the hole, roughens the surface for adhesion, and ensures it\u2019s wide enough to push the tire plug into it.\u00a0\n\n2. Insert a Plug Into the Probe\n\nPull one of the tacky plugs from the backing paper and insert it into the eyelet on the probe with about half of the plug hanging out each side.\n\n3. Push the Probe Into the Tire\n\nForcefully push the probe into the hole in the tire until only 1/3 of the plug is showing on the outside. Then, pull it out rapidly in a straight motion, leaving the plug in the tire.\n\n4. Trim Away the Excess\n\nLeaving the tag ends on the plug would be a great way for it to get pulled out. Trim away the excess material even with the tire tread.\n\n5. Inflate the Tire and Recheck for leaks\n\nUsing the pressure found on the driver\u2019s door placard, inflate the tire to the correct pressure and spray it down again.\u00a0\n\n6. Install it on your car.\n\nRe-fit the wheel onto the hub and tighten it with your tire wrench. Lower the jack and re-tighten the wheel.\u00a0\n\nHow to use a tire patch kit\u00a0\n\nTire patches alone aren\u2019t enough for an approved repair either, but a tire plug-patch or a tire patch on top of a plug can do the trick. If your plan is a permanent repair, you\u2019ll need to take the tire off the rim.\u00a0\u00a0\nDeflate the tire completely, then break the tire bead away from the rim lip. You\u2019ll need a bunch of force to make this happen whether it\u2019s a press or by placing something very heavy on the tire. Then, use tire bars to pry the tire bead off the rim.\u00a0\nOn the inside of the tire, find the hole you\u2019ve reamed but, instead of inserting a plug, scuff the inner liner with a rasp to rough it up and clean it. Remove any loose bits of rubber. Put a layer of rubber cement on the rubber that\u2019s about a \u00bd-inch wider than the patch size. And let it dry. Push the rigid post for the plug-patch through the hole from the inside, then grasp it from the outside with pliers and pull it until the patch is fully seated. Now you have both the plug in the hole and a patch covering from the inside. Press the patch firmly against the adhesive to seal it.\u00a0\nNow you\u2019re ready to re-mount, inflate, and install the wheel on the car.\u00a0\n\nFix Flat Tires with Slime\n\nTire plugs vs patches: What is the Correct Way to Plug a Tire?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe approved way to fix a tire is with a combination plug-patch, and any plug kit for tires alone is a temporary fix. And how long can you drive on a tire with a plug in it? There\u2019s no safe distance you can measure out. It\u2019s just meant to get you to a time and place when it can be fixed properly or the tire replaced.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you are still experiencing problems with your tire, look for these common signs that you need to replace your tire.",

        "title": "8 Signs Your Tires Need to be Replaced",
        "content": "Warning Signs You Need New Tires\n\n1. They Simply Don\u2019t Grip\n\nSome tires can be brand new but feel like you\u2019re driving on ice, even when the road\u2019s perfectly dry. What\u2019s most important for tires is that you feel safe while you\u2019re behind the wheel. A car equipped with summer-only tires won\u2019t perform well in wintery conditions, even when the tires are brand new. If the tires your vehicle has on it right now don\u2019t get you the grip you need to feel confident, change them.\n\n2. An Ill-Placed Puncture\n\nMost punctures in the tread section can be repaired, and only the combination plug-patch is an approved repair according to the Tire industry Association. But some punctures are in an area that flexes too much, near the shoulder, or in the sidewall and can\u2019t be safely repaired. As well, punctures that are more than \u00bc-inch in diameter or close enough that the patches will overlap just aren\u2019t going to work. Unfortunately, a puncture in the wrong place condemns a tire to being replaced.\n\n3. The Tread is Worn Down\n\nThe most prevalent indicator for when your car needs a new tire is tread depth. Evenly worn, your car should always have at least 2/32nds of an inch tread depth remaining in all sections on the tire \u2013 more is even better. This measurement is taken from the wear bars \u2013 a small section between tread blocks that\u2019s raised slightly.  \nTake measurements across the tread and around the circumference. If your tread is at or below 2/32nds, it\u2019s time to replace the tires.\n\n4. Uneven Tread Wear\n\nMechanical issues will affect your car\u2019s tires. If the alignment is out of spec, there are loose steering parts, or you have worn suspension components, it can put added strain on your tires or change the angle at which they touch the road. If that\u2019s the case on your vehicle, you may notice an inside or outside shoulder has much more wear than the center tread section or a condition known as feathering where the tread blocks wear in an odd shape. As well, over-inflated or under-inflated tires can wear the center section or the shoulders respectively.\n\n5. Bulges or Cuts\n\nNicks and scratches in the rubber are no big deal, but a bulge or a cut is. A bulge happens when air gets between the inner liner and the outer rubber layers, usually caused by curb impact or a death-defying pothole. Cuts can be anything from road debris to vandalism, and a cut that\u2019s deeper than the outer layer is too deep to be driven on safely.\n\n6. Cracks Between Tread Blocks\n\nAs tires age, the rubber dries out. Cracks are normal to see as fine lines between the tread blocks, on the shoulder, and on the sidewalls. It\u2019s known as dry-rot, and it\u2019s spurred on primarily by the sun\u2019s UV rays. When those cracks get wider and wider, to the point where you can either peel bits of rubber off or get the ballpoint of a pen in it, the tire should definitely be replaced.\n\n7. Steel or Fabric Cords are Showing\n\nInside your tire, Kevlar, cotton, or synthetic fabric strands are used to help it maintain its shape and reinforce its strength. Steel cords are crucial for helping keep the tire in the right shape as well as provide rigidity in key areas like the bead. These are structural components in the tire, and if you can see them, there\u2019s a big problem with the tire. Odds are you\u2019ve already missed the earlier warning signs and the tire is in dangerous, unsafe condition to be driven on.\n\n8. They\u2019re Expired\n\nDid you know that tires have an expiry date? Unlike produce at the grocery store, they aren\u2019t necessarily going to go bad immediately afterward though. Tires \u201cexpire\u201d six years after their manufacture date. On the sidewall of every tire, you\u2019ll find a small four-digit number near the bead. The first two digits are the week of manufacture during the year and the last two digits represent the year it was made. For example, a manufacture code of 2719 would indicate the tire was made the 27th week of the year \u2013 likely the first week of July \u2013 of 2019. If your tires are more than six years past their manufacture date, expect that the time to change them is nearing. If your tires are over 10 years old, most tire companies won\u2019t even touch the tire for mount / dismount or repair.\n\nHow to Know If Your Tires Are Still Good\nIf your tires pass with flying colors according to these signs, there\u2019s one final check to ensure they\u2019re still good. Take a good, old-fashioned American penny and insert it between the tread blocks. Turn it so Lincoln\u2019s head is pointed toward the tire, and look across the tread. Can you see the top of Lincoln\u2019s dome? If so, your tires are worn out. If the top of his head is covered by the tire tread, they still have at least 2/32nds of an inch remaining on the tread.\n\nIf you do decide that you need your tires replaced, check out our list of Preferred Shops in your area, to find a shop that sells and replaces tires.",

        "title": "Spare Tire & Jack Maintenance",
        "content": "How to Maintain Your Spare Tire & Jack\n\n1. Check Pressure Monthly\n\nCheck your tire pressures at least once a month. That said \u2013 everyone remembers the 4 tires on the road, but don\u2019t forget the spare! Remember, going into cold winter months, gasses compress and your tire pressure will go down even if no air escapes from a tire (thanks, science!). Going into summer months, pressures expand, so if you filled your tire over winter to get to 32-38PSI, you\u2019ll be surprised when suddenly that\u2019s 35-42 PSI!\n\n2. Check the Spare Tire with the Others\n\nGet in the habit of ALWAYS checking your spare tire when you check your other tires. When taking your car to an Oil Change place, request that they check the spare. Often times, this is not something they do.\n\n3. Make Sure You Have the Right Jack\n\nMake sure your jack is the proper one to lift your car. Often times, jacks are borrowed or swapped. Make sure all the handle-tools are available to work the jack. Get familiar with how it works \u2013 a great idea is to do a practice-run and make sure the jack is performing properly and lifting the car correctly. If your jack is missing, a small, compact bottle jack like 80303T, or scissor jack T10202D can take it\u2019s place.\n\n4. Confirm That Your Lug Wrench Works\n\nMake sure your lug wrench tool is the correct one for your current lug nuts. Nothing is worse than having a jack and spare tire, only to find out your lug wrench is missing, is wrong, or that you have a lug-lock on each wheel! First, make sure you have a lug wrench available. Next, make sure it fits your lugs and check to see if you have a lug-lock (a lugnut with a locking pattern, requiring a tool to turn the lug nut to prevent theft of a wheel/tire). Many times, aftermarket wheels and even some factory wheels now come with a lug lock. Sometimes it\u2019s in the glove box, sometimes its in with the spare tire tools \u2013 and other times, it\u2019s missing. Also, make sure your lug wrench properly fits the lug lock! Sometimes they are a different size! Check each and every lug nut on the car and be sure your lug wrench fits. In rare cases, an aftermarket replacement lug nut (or one someone put on there because it appeared that it \u201cfit\u201d) may be a different size than your lug wrench. Check them all! If you need a lug wrench for your vehicle, Dorman 20564 or PowerBuilt 642250 will work perfectly. \n\n5. Test Your Spare Tire Hoist\n\nMost trucks and SUV\u2019s are equipped with a spare tire under the vehicle. This tire is lifted by what\u2019s called a Spare Tire Hoist. To get the tire down, you insert a rod in through the back bumper (also make sure you have that rod!) and the hoist is cranked down, dropping the spare tire to the ground. The problem with this system is 2-fold \u2013 lack of use, and road dirt, water, and salt/rust if you\u2019re in the rust-belt. Every 2 oil changes, it\u2019s a great idea to crank down the tire, and crank it back up. Most of these systems are semi-sealed meaning they are built to not need to be lubricated, but some are relatively open, and can be lubed with WD40, chain lube, or protected with Fluid-Film. Never assume this hoist is going to work and always make sure! Even the sealed hoist systems get water and dirt that penetrate into them, and after 15 years of non-use, they stop working. Nothing is worse than to be half-under your bed in 100 degree heat, on the side of the highway, and your spare tire is stuck.\n\n6. Don\u2019t Bolt the Spare in Place Too Tightly\n\nIf your spare tire is located on the back of the vehicle (like some SUV\u2019s and Jeeps) it\u2019s usually lurking under a protective cover of some kind, and often hasn\u2019t seen the light of day in years. While often times its difficult to remove and re-install this cover, it\u2019s the only way you can check the pressure of your spare tire. Another tip is to make sure your lug nuts (usually 3) that hold the spare tire to the rack are not rusty or over-tightened. You have to be able to remove them easily. These spare tires are notorious for being flat and leaking all their air from non-use.\n\n7. Don\u2019t Rely on Emergency Services for Equipment\n\nNever assume that an emergency service will be available when you need. Knowing how to change to your spare tire, and that all your emergency items are up to speed is vitally important. Often times emergency services will attempt to change the tire for you, and if your equipment is missing, or flat, you\u2019ll be forced into having your vehicle towed, which could cost you money. Remember emergency vehicles may have the tools to get your tire off, but they are reliant on your spare tire actually working. Many spare tires, especially under trucks, if not checked regularly can be so dry-rotted that they physically cannot hold air.\n\n8. Keep Tabs on the Spare\u2019s Date Code\n\nWhen changing your tires to a new set, ask your tire shop to check the spare\u2019s date code. If the tire is older than 10 years and not a \u201ctrunk tire\u201d that is sealed and not exposed to the elements, it\u2019s a good idea to either purchase a new spare tire, or rotate one of the tires you are taking off your vehicle into spare duty.\n\n9. Torque Lug Nuts to the Proper Spec\n\nFinally, when having any service done on your car where a wheel is going to be removed, ask that your lug nuts are hand-torqued to the proper spec. Nothing is worse than having your lug nuts zipped down with an impact wrench and over-torqued, only to find that your lugs are so tight you cannot remove them on the side of the road with your lug wrench!\n\nBy following these maintenance steps, you are insuring that your car\u2019s emergency tire gear is working and functioning properly, and that you\u2019re prepared in the event of an emergency.\n\nFind a Nearby AutoZone",

        "title": "How to Replace Hubcaps",
        "content": "Do Hubcaps Serve a Purpose?\n\nYour vehicle\u2019s tires mount on a rim that attaches to a hub assembly. While tires, wheels, and other components are usually built to withstand considerable punishment, you do not want to weaken the integrity of your wheels by allowing dust or moisture to penetrate sensitive areas. Your vehicle\u2019s hubcaps help deflect particles away from the wheel assembly. They also cover unattractive components, giving your vehicle a sleek and aesthetically pleasing appearance.\nWhile hubcaps come in a variety of sizes and styles, they are all discs. Because they stick out a bit from the edge of your tire, they are prone to damage in curb scrapes, and if you drive on a very rough stretch of roadway, your hubcaps could potentially jiggle loose. Whether you have a damaged hub cap or a missing one, replacing your wheel cover should be a top priority.\n\nWhat Types of Hubcaps Are There?\n\nCar hubcaps typically come in three different styles. As such, before trying to remove or replace an existing wheel covering, you must know what you are dealing with. Here are the common types of hubcaps:\nPop-on hubcaps: These hubcaps pop onto your wheel and secure in place with plastic clips.Screw-on hubcaps: These hubcaps have a plastic nut that screws onto your vehicle\u2019s lug nuts.Bolt-on hubcaps: These hubcaps attach to your vehicle\u2019s wheel using the same lug nuts that hold the wheel in place.\nBecause there is no standard style of hubcaps, you may need to do some work to determine which type your car has. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual is a good place to start. Simply check the tire and wheel section of the manual for more information. If that does not do the trick, you can examine the hubcaps. Pulling gently on the side of the hubcap may tell you whether you have bolt-on or pop-on wheel covers.\n\nHow to Replace Each Type of Hubcap\n\n1. Replacement for Pop-On Caps\n\nIf you have pop-on hubcaps, removing and replacing your wheel coverings is simple. Before you begin the project, make sure your car is parked on a flat surface and the motor is not running. Also, engage the parking brake and chock the wheels.\nThen, simply work two wide-end flat screw drivers onto opposite sides of the hubcap. Work your way around the hubcap until the cover pops loose. Then, install the new cap by placing it over the wheel and pressing firmly on opposite sides. You may need to gently tap each new pop-on hubcap into place.\n\n2. Replacement for Screw-On Caps\n\nScrew-on caps have a plastic nut that attaches to your vehicle\u2019s existing lugs. Replacing this type of hubcap is also easy, as you only have to unscrew each plastic nut to remove the hub cap. Again, protect yourself by parking your car on a flat surface, engaging the parking brake, and chocking the wheels.\nAfter you have removed the plastic components, simply put the new hubcap into place. Then, tighten each plastic nut. Do not use a power tool for this project though. Doing so may over-tighten nuts, causing them to track and fail.\nIf your vehicle has screw-on caps, you should realize that plastic nuts may work themselves loose over time. Because you do not want to lose your hubcaps, periodically check the tightness of the plastic nuts that hold each hubcap in place. If you notice looseness, hand tighten the nuts to keep your hubcaps secure.\n\n3. Replacement for Bolt-On Caps\n\nReplacing bolt-on hubcaps is a bit more involved than the other types of hubcaps. Still, if you have old, damaged, or unattractive wheel coverings, you need to know how to put on hubcaps on your vehicle. After preparing your vehicle to prevent rolling (flat surface, parking brake, wheel chocks), you are ready to begin.\nFirst, pick a lug nut and use the wrench that came with your vehicle\u2019s jack to turn it counterclockwise. Do not completely remove the lug nut, though, Instead, only loosen it.\nThen, move to the lug nut on the opposite side from the first lug nut you loosened and loosen it. After loosening opposite lug nuts all around the wheel, remove each lug nut one-by-one. Be sure not to loosen the plastic washers that are with each lug nut. Do not remove the tire.\nAfter you have removed the lug nuts and washers, your hubcap should slide off the wheel. If you have built-up gunk, though, the hubcap may be a bit stuck. Therefore, you may have to use a flat screwdriver to work the hubcap loose. After the hubcap is off, you can slide the new hubcap onto the exposed lug nuts.\nOnce you have the new hubcap in place, you are ready to reattach the lug nuts. Start by screwing each nut into place with your hands. When doing so, be careful not to cross thread the nuts. If each nut does not screw onto the lug easily, you may not have the threads lined up quite right.\nAfter hand tightening each lug nut, grab your lug wrench. Working in an opposite pattern, tighten each lug nut. Then, go around the wheel in a circular pattern to be sure each lug nut is firmly tightened. If you are replacing more than one hubcap, repeat the process on each wheel.\n\nFinal\u00a0Touches\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "When to Replace Your Tires",
        "content": "When to Replace Tires\n\n1. Keep an Eye on the Miles\n\nAll tires are rated for a certain number of miles. The better the tire, the higher the mileage rating it will have. This means the tire should be in good condition up until that point. Many tire stores will give you a credit on your next purchase should you need to replace the current set before reaching the mileage. You can find tires rated anywhere between 30,000 and 70,000. If you are getting close to the end of your tires\u2019 lifespans, then it\u2019s just about time to start shopping for some new ones.\n\n2. Tread Depth\n\nThis is one of the most obvious visual signs that you can rely on. Tire tread is critical for gripping the road, especially in poor weather conditions such as rain and snow. Balding tires can slip and slide all over the road. The lower the tread depth, the longer it will take to bring the car to a stop, particularly when the road is wet.\nYou can measure tread depth in inches or millimeters. It\u2019s worth checking to learn the recommended tread depth for your tires. Generally anything above 1/16th of an inch indicates a healthy tire and no need to replace it. Once the tire gets below this, you should purchase a new set right away.\nTire gauges can show the depth for you. Or, you can try the penny trick. Place a Lincoln penny head-down in the tread. If you still see the great president\u2019s entire head, there isn\u2019t enough tread on the tire. This trick works in a pinch, but you should be sure to check with a tire gauge as soon as possible.\n\n3. Uneven Wear\n\nOne of the most common wear issues, this tell-tale sign of an alignment problem. Uneven wear can cause the outer or inner portion of the tire to wear quicker, as this portion of the tire is making firmer contact with the road. Be sure when checking tire tread depth to inspect the inside and outside edges of the tire for excessive wear. More importantly, if you discover an uneven wear problem, you need to get it rectified with a proper alignment. Replacing the tires without correcting the problem will only lead to premature wear of new tires in the exact same fashion.\nTires should all wear evenly, and the two biggest reasons they don\u2019t is because of alignment issues or not properly rotating tires. Tire rotation may seem like a hassle, but it\u2019s necessary as your steering tires wear differently than your rear tires. Even though you may not be able to see the differences in wear visually over several thousand miles, it\u2019s there. Don\u2019t skip this important maintenance and have your tires rotated. Most of the industry recommends having them rotated every oil change, or at a bare minimum, every 10K miles.\n\n4. Sidewall Cracks\n\nTread depth isn\u2019t the only thing you can quickly look at on the tire. Another symptom of bad tires can be cracks or dry-rotting in the sidewalls. If you see cuts or grooves in the sidewall, it\u2019s definitely time to get a new set. You shouldn\u2019t have to get too close to notice this damage. When it\u2019s easily visible, you know the tires have come to the end of their life.\nThis damage is a clear indication that the tires are losing air. More dangerously, the sidewalls provide tires with most of their structural support, so it may mean they\u2019re about to blow. You don\u2019t want to be on the road when this happens, take care of the issue now.\n\n5. Tires Bulging\n\nWhat is known as a tire blister can indicate that the tire is about to pop. This shows you that the outer part of the tire is weakening and doesn\u2019t have much time left before it bursts. If you see this sign, don\u2019t wait another day to have a mechanic inspect it.\n\n6. You See the Indicator Bar\n\nIn the old days, there was no such thing as a tread wear indicator bar. This isn\u2019t the case today. Most new products have this handy tool to clue you in that the tire doesn\u2019t have many miles left in it. You will have a difficult time seeing this bar when you first purchase the tire. Gradually, as the tire gets more and more use, the bar will become clear.\nThe bars are made of raised rubber and run perpendicular to the tread patterns. You shouldn\u2019t worry too much if you see one bar, but when two or three become clear, it means there isn\u2019t much tread left.\n\n7. You Feel the Car Vibrate\n\nHave you experienced that annoying vibrating feeling as you drive? You may notice it more when you\u2019re going downhill and apply the brakes. Various issues can cause your car to vibrate, but it could be the tires. Often, it indicates an imbalance issue. It may also mean something is wrong inside the tire.\nDon\u2019t ignore these sensations. Even if the tire isn\u2019t the culprit, the vibrating could harm the tire and damage it severely. A professional mechanic can get to the bottom of the problem and recommend a solution, whether it\u2019s getting new tires or something else.\n\n8. Check the Dates of the Tires\n\nAll modern tires have a \u201cborn-on\u201d date. This date is marked with a series of numbers starting with  the words \u201cDOT\u201d on the sidewall. The manufacturer date normally the last 4 digits of this number and represents the week, and year the tire was made. For instance, a DOT code of 4112 would indicate a tire manufactured in the 41st week of 2011. DOT codes with 3 digits indicate a tire made before the year 2000, which is really old. Many date codes can be slightly different, but there are plenty of online sources to help you see and understand how to read a date code on your tires. Most major tire installers won\u2019t even mount a used tire that\u2019s over 10 years old.\nEven if your tires tread is in decent shape, if your tires are approaching 10 years old, it\u2019s a good idea to replace them. As rubber ages, it hardens and looses its ability to properly grip the road. This can be especially problematic in colder temps, even when there is no ice or water on the roads. Pay very close attention to spare tires over 10 years, especially those exposed to the elements like Pickup Truck spare tires. Many folks are shocked to realize their 16 year old truck still has the original spare tire. You can read here more about maintaining your spare tire.\n\nPreserving the\u00a0Life of Your Tires\n\nYou expect to buy new tires every few years. The more you drive, the more often you\u2019ll need to make this financial commitment. Still, there are ways you can get more life out of them and make sure they last up to and even beyond the manufacture\u2019s mileage rating. Rotating the tires is one of the simplest things you can do. It\u2019s critical to change the position of the tires every 5,000 to 6,000 miles. Move driver\u2019s side tires to the passenger\u2019s side; move front tires to the back and back tires to the front. Doing this will reduce uneven wear.\nAnother way to prevent uneven wear is to check the tire alignment. Over time, they can stop running straight ahead. This will cause some parts of the tire to wear out much faster than other parts. Check with tire manufacturer to see how often you should do an alignment. Generally, it is a good idea to do this every year.\nLastly, keep an eye on inflation levels. It can be easy to ignore this, but it\u2019s critical that they are not under-inflated or over-inflated. Purchase a tire gauge and test the pressure every time you fill up the\u00a0gas tank. Improper levels can wear out a tire faster than anything.\nAll drivers should pay attention to the question, \u201cWhen should tires be replaced?\u201d Nothing is more important than safety when you are in the\u00a0driver\u2019s seat\u00a0of your vehicle. You can also save money and hassle in the long run when you follow these guidelines and take good care of your tires. Don\u2019t put off maintenance issues or tire replacements for any reason.",

        "title": "Bad Tie Rod Symptoms to Watch Out For",
        "content": "What Are\u00a0Tie Rod Ends?\n\nA tie rod is a threaded steel or cast iron tube, with a small pivoting ball joint on the end. Its purpose is to connect the steering gear mechanism (either a gear box or rack and pinion) outward to the wheels. Tie rods are generally divided between inner tie rods, which attach directly to the rack and pinion, and outer tie rods, which attach to the steering knuckle out by the wheel. These two tie rods are usually connected with an adjusting sleeve, or the inner and outer simply connect, with the inner being the adjusting device. This allows adjustment and precise alignment of the two wheels/tires. When you turn your steering wheel either left or right, this structure is responsible for conveying that movement to the wheels and ultimately turning the car in the direction you want it to go.\nTie rod ends also contain several internal parts you should be aware of. The small ball joint mentioned earlier on the end of the tie rod contains a bearing, similar to suspension ball joints. This bearing allows this joint to flex freely up or down with suspension travel or turn in and out with the turning of the wheels/tires. This joint is protected by a rubber boot that keeps lubricating grease in, and water/dirt out. Just like suspension ball joints, tie rods historically have had grease fittings to keep them properly lubricated, although many today are not serviceable.\n\nIdentifying Potential\u00a0Tie Rod Issues\n\nAs you can see, a car\u2019s tie rod ends have a lot to do with how well you can control your car, so you\u2019ll definitely want to learn the signs of tie rod ends that need to be serviced or replaced sooner. The following are among the most common problems to keep an eye out for.\n\nDo you tires appear to be wearing unevenly or excessively? This could indicate a number of problems, and a tie rod end that\u2019s failing could easily be one of them. Faulty tie rod ends can cause unusually heavy wear on either the inner or the outer portion of the tire, so make sure you check for both. You can\u00a0read more about ball joints here.\nOne of the primary symptoms of faulty or failing tie rod ends can also cause your\u00a0steering wheel\u00a0to feel loose or wandering when you\u2019re operating your vehicle. This is caused from the joint on the end of the tie rod deteriorating, creating slop. Over time, this joint can get so bad that it begins to knock going over bumps, and eventually so bad, that it can physically separate from the tie rod itself, sending the knuckle and wheel completely sideways.\nAs stated before, when tie rods get to a failure state that is dangerously serious, they will begin to pop and click, as this joint gets loose. If you hear any of these noises turning or going over bumps, keep in mind that it could be a myriad of suspension items, but doing a thorough tie rod check can rule the tie rods out.\n\nTo perform a tie rod check, it\u2019s best to first put your vehicle on drive-up ramps as this allows you to check the tie rods under the load of vehicle weight. You can perform this with the car jacked up and on secure jack stands as well, but the ramp method is preferred. Once the car is lifted, locate both outer tie rods on the steering knuckle and follow them inward to the inner tie rods. Grab ahold of this steering rod with your hand and attempt to move it straight up and down. Listen and feel for any looseness or clicking as there should be none. Do the same by attempting to move the rod forward and back \u2013 towards the front and rear of the car. Now, grab the rod and try to twist it. A good tie rod, both inner and outer should have either no twist, or a slight twist in both directions as you will see the outer tie rod pivot back and forth allowing this twist. If this joint is extremely loose and requires no effort at all to twist, the joint is going bad.\nSometimes during the alignment process, a shop may tell you that a tie rod is bad because it is seized inside the adjusting sleeve, or the inner and outer units are seized together. This is rather common on old suspension parts and usually requires complete replacement, or a longer job and use of heat / torch and multi treatments of penetrating lubricant to break these two free. You may encounter this at some point where a shop will give you the dreaded phone call of, \u201cWe can\u2019t align it\u201d. If this happens, you\u2019ll need to replace parts and get it back in for alignment again.\n\nTaking Care of Your\u00a0Tie Rod Ends\n\nAs stated before, historically, tie rods, ball joints, and even some bushings on your car have all had greaseable fittings to allow regularly greasing of these items during oil change. Within the last 15 years, many manufacturers have gone to sealed bearings that are non-serviceable. Many though, still require grease and if you have these, they should be greased on a regular basis. You should see a grease fitting directly on the head of the outer tie rod, right on the steering knuckle. Give it a quick cleaning and then use a grease gun to push new, clean lubrication through the rod. As you push new grease in, you\u2019ll see the old grease come out along with any dirt, debris, or grit that may have become stuck in it over time. It\u2019s just one extra step added to your\u00a0oil change routine, but it can make a\u202fbig\u202fdifference in the lifespan of your tie rod ends.\n\nShop Suspension, Steering, Tire, and Wheel Parts",

        "title": "Is your Wheel Hub Assembly worn out?",
        "content": "Signs of a Worn Out Wheel Assembly\n\n1. Roaring Sounds From Wheels\n\nProbably the most common failure in the hub assembly has to do with the bearings. When a bearing starts to wear out, parts of the hub assembly can start to rub against each other, creating an awful noise. If you hear and/or feel a roaring or humming sound that increases with speed, inspect the wheel hub assembly.\n\n2. Loose Wheels\n\nYou may only notice this when changing a tire, or it may take a mechanic to see this. But if the wheel or tire feels looser than normal when it\u2019s in the air, it could be a worn hub assembly problem. The entire steering and suspension system should be inspected at the same time.\n\n3. Illuminated ABS Light\n\nIf your ABS (Anti-Lock Brakes) light is illuminated with a wheel sensor failure code, the ABS sensor may need to be replaced provided all the vehicle wiring harness and related components are secure and properly functioning. Many vehicles are designed with the ABS sensor made into the wheel hub assembly and cannot be replaced separately. For these applications a new wheel hub assembly will be required. The ABS sensor provides critical input for safe stopping and oversteer control. Do not delay if the light illuminates.\n\nThink you need a new hub assembly?",

        "title": "How to Replace an Outer Tie End",
        "content": "HOW TO REPLACE AN OUTER TIE END\n\n1. SAFETY FIRST\n\nPark your vehicle on a flat, dry surface and install wheel chocks. Wear appropriate gloves and safety goggles. Lift the car, place it on jack stands and remove the wheels for easy access.\n\n2. LOCATE THE OUTER TIE ROD END\n\nLocate the outer tie rod end. The ball with stud and locking nut attaches to the steering knuckle (spindle) next to the tire. If you have penetrating oil, it\u2019s a good practice to spray the jam nut and threads, along with the top castle nut with penetrating oil, as these are often very corroded. The outer tie rod will be connected on one side to the steering knuckle with a what is usually a castle nut and a cotter pin which keeps it from loosening. The other side of the tie rod is threaded, and connects to either an inner tie rod (on rack and pinion systems) or a center link, drag link, or adjusting sleeve, which any of these reside in more traditional steering systems, and some trucks still today. \n\n3. REMOVE THE TIE ROD\u2019S STUD NUT AND SEPARATE\n\nAs stated before, the tie rod connects to the steering knuckle of the car on each side with a tapered stud and nut. This nut is usually a castle-style nut with a cotter pin, but sometimes it is a Nylock nut. For a castle nut, remove the cotter pin. Many times these can be corroded and a pain to remove. Make sure to flood the nut down with penetrating oil. Next, remove the nut. You will now need a tie rod separator, otherwise known as a \u201cpickle-fork\u201d to dislodge the tapered stud from it\u2019s bore. You will insert the fork between the tie rod and knuckle, and hammer until the tie rod drops and separates. Sometimes, this process can take time, as many tie rods are very stubborn. \n\n4. LOOSEN THE JAM NUT (R&P TYPE) OR ADJUST SLEEVE NUT (CENTER LINK TYPE)\n\nfor R&P Type\nOne nice part with rack and pinion outer tie rods is that they often can be removed from the car without upsetting the alignment specs. The outer tie rod end threads onto the inner tie rod end and is held securely in place with a jam nut. Ensure the threads behind the nut are clean. Using a holding tool in one hand, secure the inner and outer tie rod ends while loosening the jam nut with a wrench in the other hand. Do not allow the \u2018loosening pressure\u2019 to put excessive pressure on the rack and pinion\u2019s inner tie rod. This may harm the gear or seal. Keep in mind, jam nuts will often loosen with either left or right hand threads, so sometimes turning the nut to the right will loosen it. Back the nut away and mark the position of the outer tie rod end with a small amount of paint. This will identify how far to thread the new tie rod end onto the inner tie rod. Now, you can unthread the tie rod end. Many times, you\u2019ll need a pair of locking pliers or wrench to turn the tie rod out. Once out, compare the lengths of your new tie rod to the old, and the mark you made showing exactly where the jam nut was threaded. You can then transfer this mark or location over to the new tie rod and check measurements from the mark to the center line of the tapered stud to be sure both marks are exactly the same.\nOR for Center Link Type\nThe outer tie rod end screws into the tie rod adjusting sleeve. Loosen the adjusting sleeve locking clamp and nut that holds the outer tie rod end. Do not loosen the inner tie rod locking nut. You will likely need to apply penetrant to the adjusting sleeve and outer tie rod end threads. Allow to soak while performing the next steps. Mark the tie rod end position with a small amount of paint. This will identify how far to thread the new tie rod end into the adjusting sleeve. Keep in mind that many tie rods have either left-hand or right hand threads, meaning you may be turning the tie rod to the right to loosen it. \n\n5. INSTALL THE NEW TIE ROD END\n\nThread the new tie rod end onto the inner tire rod end or into the tie rod adjusting sleeve. Position as close as possible to the original tie rods position. With the new rubber grease boot in place on the tie rod end, insert the threaded ball stud into the steering knuckle mounting hole. Install the locking nut and new cotter pin. Be sure and tighten the to the proper manufactures specification torque. This is important! If the nut loosens or the threads are damaged due to overtightening, the tie rod end could separate and cause an accident! So, be careful.\nNote: Some new tie rod ends use self-locking nuts that do not incorporate a cotter pin. Either design will work.\nNow, firmly tighten the jam nut or adjusting sleeve nut. Use both tools on the jam nut style just like beforehand to avoid damaging the R&P. If equipped, install the grease fitting. Use a grease lube gun and fill the new tie rod end with chassis lubricant. Do not over do it! Now is a good time to check and lubricate the other suspension and steering components.\n\n6. INSTALL WHEEL AND LUG NUTS\n\nInstall wheel and wheel nuts. Torque wheel nuts to owner manual specifications. Then, remove the tire jacks. Now is a good time to check the tire pressures.\n\n7. CHECK YOUR STEERING\n\nCheck the steering for smooth operation. The steering wheel should turn normally with no binding or catching. The steering wheel may be off \u2013 centered. This is due to the wheel alignment changes after the part installation.\n\n8. GET AN ALIGNMENT\n\nAs mentioned before, some tie rod changes can get you close enough to original location that an alignment isn\u2019t needed, but often it is, and regardless, it\u2019s always recommended. Normally, over time your vehicle\u2019s alignment will be out of spec anyways and should be tended to. To seek alignment help, or help with a tie rod change, check out our list of Preferred Shops in your area, and look closely for ones who specialize in alignment work as many shops do not do alignments. \n\n Pro Tip: \u00a0You have made changes to the steering of your car.\u00a0 This means your wheel alignment is not aligned correctly.\u00a0 Take the vehicle to a front end alignment shop before you drive any distances.\u00a0 If you don\u2019t, your vehicle will not steer correctly. \n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "How to Use a Torque Wrench",
        "content": "How Does a Torque Wrench Work?\n\nBefore you start a project, you\u2019ll want to understand a common question among DIYers: \u201cHow does a torque wrench work?\u201d You\u2019ll then be better prepared to use the wrench during maintenance and repair jobs. Additionally, understanding how this tool works allows you to avoid user errors that could damage your vehicle.\u00a0\nScientifically speaking, torque is defined as a twisting force. As an example, wheel lug nuts require a specific amount of applied force for safety and to maintain stability while driving. Over-tightening can subject bolts to additional strain, which can cause them to seize and stripping to occur. Ultimately, this results in damage to the wheels and axles over time. Therefore, ensuring the correct amount of torque is applied prevents this damage and improves overall stability while on the road. The same principle is true for other fasteners too.\nA torque wrench measures the amount of torque applied to the bolt when you tighten it. There are three basic types of torque wrenches you may encounter, each of which works slightly differently, but ultimately achieves the same result. The three main types of torque wrenches are as follows:\n\nThe beam type: This type of torque wrench includes a beam that has a precise amount of flexion. As you pull on the wrench, the beam bends slightly and the needle attached to it shows the value on a gauge at the base, showing the amount of torque applied to the bolt.\n\nThe dial indicator: This torque wrench is a simplified version of the beam torque wrench. As the name suggests, this wrench includes a dial that adjusts to display the amount of torque on each bolt.\nThe clicker type: The click torque wrench provides a spring-loaded mechanism that allows you to set the desired torque level. When you\u2019ve successfully reached this level, the spring mechanics release, making a clicking sound that notifies the user that they have reached their desired torque.\n\nDespite being different, each of these wrenches helps measure the torque, or twisting force, applied to your bolts. Among the different types are variations to choose from like a split beam torque wrench, a slip torque wrench, and electronic versions too. Ultimately, this function is the same: to determine how tight the fastener is.\n\nCalibrating Your Torque Wrench\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to understand how to calibrate a torque wrench since these tools are designed to take precise measurements. If it isn\u2019t accurate, you could be under- or over-tightening fasteners. Over time, however, the measurements can become less accurate. Therefore, these tools require routine calibration to ensure they are performing correct measurements. Because of these measurements\u2019 exact nature, it may be in your best interest to take your torque wrench to a professional to have it calibrated.\u00a0\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to calibrate your torque wrench at home by performing basic physics calculations. \n\nFirst, you\u2019ll want to measure the length of the handle of the torque wrench itself. Most standard torque wrenches are approximately 24 inches long; although, you should still measure yours to the nearest inch.\nNext, secure your wrench head or driver, and tighten it into the socket appropriately. You\u2019ll then want to put a weight on the end of the wrench and calculate the appropriate setting for the weight you selected.\nOnce you\u2019ve performed your basic calculation, you\u2019ll adjust the spring tension for your torque wrench. Typically, there\u2019s a screw located approximately halfway up your wrench handle. By tightening this screw, you can make minor adjustments as needed to determine the appropriate torque.\u00a0\n\nThe process above is only one basic guideline for adjusting and calibrating torque settings. Most torque wrenches come with a manual with directions on calibrating. It\u2019s best to follow these guidelines as they will explain the precise calculations and step-by-step instructions for your specific wrench.\n\nSetting and Using Your Torque Wrench\n\nLastly, before you perform any maintenance on your vehicle, you need to understand how to set a torque wrench. As previously mentioned, there are several different types of torque wrenches. For the gauge and beam styles, there isn\u2019t a setting aside from watching the gauge since they\u2019re purely mechanical in nature. However, the most common is the clicker-style torque wrench, which we will focus on here.\u00a0\nA traditional clicker torque wrench is relatively easy to use. To determine the amount of torque you need, you must reference your owner\u2019s manual or other manufacturer guidelines. Torque settings are detailed here, and you must follow these instructions to avoid over-tightening bolts, nuts, and other fasteners. If you\u2019re uncertain and no longer have access to your owner\u2019s manual, you can often do a quick Google search to find digital copies for your reference.\u00a0\nOnce you\u2019ve located the torque required for each bolt, you\u2019ll set your wrench to the correct setting on the handle. For some wrenches, slide to the right setting and begin tightening your bolts. For others, turn the handle to loosen or tighten it until you reach the correct marking. A set screw on the handle locks it in place. Then, use it. When you\u2019ve reached the required torque, you\u2019ll hear an audible click from the wrench.\nYour owner manual will also provide you with detailed instructions on ensuring you\u2019ve set your torque wrench to the correct torque setting. For specific questions regarding setting torque, you should reference these instructions.\u00a0\n\nConclusion\n\nUltimately, torque wrenches are relatively easy to use and have a wide range of applications for vehicles and other modern appliances. Though it may seem overwhelming to learn how to use a torque wrench initially, eventually it becomes second nature. If you\u2019re careful to maintain and regularly calibrate your tools, you can use your torque wrench for many years.",

        "title": "Which Tools Do I Need to Change My Oil?",
        "content": "General Shop Tools Everyone Needs\n\nThis first group of tools are pieces that everyone needs to get started on working with their vehicles. From this group of tools, you could do an oil change on most cars with only a ratchet and socket set, a funnel, oil capture container, and a jack and jack stands.\nRatchet and Socket Set\n\nA ratchet massively reduces the time it takes to remove a fastener because you don\u2019t have to remove the tool from the bolt every time you make a turn, like you do with a combination wrench. Get a set that includes some metric and SAE sizes, and if you\u2019re starting out, a 3/8\u201d drive should do just fine. Ratchets and sockets also come in 1/4, 1/2\u2033, 3/4\u2033, and 1\u201d drives. Many medium sized kits will include ratchets and sockets in 3/8\u201d and 1/2\u2033 drive.\u00a0\nWrenches\n\nYour car is fastened together using a few thousand nuts and bolts and the simplest way to loosen them is with a wrench. Wrenches come in SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) sizes and metric sizes. Some people will refer to SAE as \u201cstandard\u201d. Most vehicles built today use metric sizes because of the globalization of the auto industry, but there are still some domestic manufacturers that rely heavily on SAE sizes. Even those domestic automakers will have parts with metric nuts and bolts on them, though.\u00a0\nFor this reason, start with a full set of metric combination wrenches and purchase an SAE set if your car requires it. A small set of wrenches can cost as little as $20-$30, with larger or professional sets that can move into the range of several hundred dollars. Don\u2019t feel like you need a professional set to start out, though.\nScrewdriver Set\n\nIf you own a car, house, or even a bike, you need a set of screwdrivers. The good thing is that multi-screwdriver sets can be inexpensive, starting around $10 for a basic set. Make sure to get a set that has a variety of Phillips and straight-slot drivers, plus Robertson and even some Torx heads.\nMaintenance Ramps\n\nOlder maintenance ramps were made of steel, but modern versions are typically made out of a high-density plastic. You simply drive up the ramp and place a chock behind the wheels that are still on the ground. This elevates part of the car that is on the ramps and allows you to access the undercarriage of the vehicle to do work. The advantage to ramps is that they are very quick \u2013 you just place them in front of the wheels, drive up, and chock the other wheels to prevent the car from rolling backwards. The disadvantage is that you can\u2019t take off the tires when using ramps, so it reduces the number of repairs that you can do. Our next tools, though, solve that problem.\nHydraulic Floor Jack and Jack Stands\n\nA floor jack has a long handle that makes pumping up the hydraulic cylinder very easy. The advantage of the floor jack is that it provides access to the wheels, so that you can switch tires, replace brake pads and rotors, work on the suspension and steering, or just complete routine visual inspections of your vehicle. Always use a set of jack stands to support the vehicle when you work under it because a hydraulic jack can fail. If you have to choose between ramps or a jack and jack stands, the latter will be the more versatile option.\u00a0\nSafety Glasses\n\nSafety glasses are a must for any work that you do around a vehicle. You only get one set of eyes, so you need to protect them.\nA Set of Rags for Cleanup\n\nYour old gym t-shirt is perfect for wiping your hands and cleaning up small spills, but a roll of shop towels is also a great addition to the garage.\n\nSpecific Oil Change Tools\n\nThese tools will help to make your oil change experience efficient and fast.\n\nOil Filter Socket, Wrench or Pliers\n\nFunnel\n\nYou\u2019ll need a funnel to avoid spilling any oil as you refill the oil capacity through the oil filler cap.\n\nOil Capture Drain Container\n\nWhen you drain your oil from the oil pan you will need to capture it in a container before transferring it to the used oil cans and taking it to your local oil recycler. Purpose built oil drain containers have a handy spout to make the transfer quick and easy.\n\nNitrile Gloves\n\nDisposable nitrile gloves aren\u2019t a must-have item, but they make the process less grimy, and they protect your hands from being covered in motor oil, which is a carcinogen.\u00a0\nCreeper\n\nA creeper is a trolley that you lie on to wheel around under your vehicle. It isn\u2019t essential, but it makes working under your vehicle easier and safer.\nGet Out There and Do It\n\nWorking on your own vehicle develops a sense of pride in your ride and in yourself. Don\u2019t wait to begin building your own set of tools, starting with the basics. When you need tools for your DIY projects, you\u2019ll find them at AutoZone along with Trustworthy Advice.",

Backyard mechanics have developed all kinds of homemade solutions, but these two tools make life easier.\nMany home mechanics use a large C-clamp to open up the caliper.\nA brake caliper spreader is a purpose-built tool that fits between the closed caliper and has a mechanism that you squeeze, ratchet or screw to expand the gap. Some brands refer to it as a \u201cbrake caliper press\u201d.

        "title": "Ramp vs. Jack Stands: Which Should You Use?",
        "content": "Ramps: Pros and Cons\n\nFor one, ramps are much quicker to set up.\u00a0Just drop the ramps down in front of each tire, drive up, set your emergency brake, and you\u2019re good to go.\u00a0Ramps get you slightly higher elevation than a jack/jack stand will, but they are limited on exactly what you can do under the vehicle\u00a0as it is resting under load. For example, you have no way to get the wheels/tires off without additionally jacking that side of the vehicle up and off the ground, which is dangerous.\nThat said, ramps are excellent for oil changes especially, and many people keep a set around just specifically for this, as the\u00a0lack of set-up time makes doing oil changes much faster.\u00a0\nOne drawback to ramps is vehicles that are lowered or low to the ground, especially\u00a0ones with very low\u00a0front\u00a0noses. To avoid this, many people\u00a0use \u201crun up boards\u201d like a piece of 2\u00d710 wood laid directly on the ground, to achieve a small amount of lift before\u00a0hitting the ramp. Sometimes this works effectively, and other times, it\u2019s downright impossible for some lowered cars to use a ramp.\nRamp pros:\nQuick set up.Higher elevation than a jack / jack stands will achieve.No need for additional jack stands.Fantastic for oil changes / lube.\nRamp cons:\nSlightly nerve-wracking to drive on/off of. Takes practice.Best if used with a spotter, which requires another person.Cannot remove the wheels/tires which eliminates a lot of jobs.Bulky / need a dedicated space to store in the garage.Difficult to use with lowered / low profile vehicles.\n\nJack / Stands: Pros and Cons\n\nThe traditional jack and jack stand is a process that takes much more time to set up properly\u00a0\u2013 find jack points, raise, set jack stand, release\u2026.repeat. Where the jack shines is now you\u00a0have the ability to\u00a0remove wheels/tires\u00a0and simply jack up one side if needed.\nJack pros:\nCan jack up single wheel or side of car.Can remove wheels / tires and perform all jobs.\nJack Cons:\nRequires purchase of both jack and jack stands.Can be dangerous if not jacked or set up properly.Time-consuming process to lift a vehicle correctly.\n\nWorking Alone?\n\nIf you\u2019re working on your car all by yourself, you might be better off with a jack and jack stands. That\u2019s because driving up on ramps, unless you are a seasoned veteran,\u00a0should always be done with a spotter. Otherwise, you run the risk of driving too far off the end of the ramp or not driving onto the ramp\u00a0with your tires properly centered.\u00a0Keep in mind, most ramps are engineered to cradle the tire and not allow roll-off\u00a0once on top, but driving your vehicle up and onto ramps can be a bit nerve-wracking for a beginner.\nThe truth is that it\u2019s always a good idea to have someone around to help you working on a car, as they can potentially spot dangerous situations before anything dangerous occurs whether you lift your car with ramps, or with a jack and stands. In either situation you are lifting a vehicle that weighs thousands of pounds, meaning there is a risk of serious injury or death if you don\u2019t take appropriate precautions. To that end make sure you know the appropriate safety precautions for your specific equipment.\n\nCheck the Weight Rating\n\nNo matter how good of quality your equipment is, it won\u2019t work if you try to lift a vehicle that exceeds the weight rating. Jacks, jack stands, and ramps are all built with specific weight ratings, which indicate the limit of how much weight they can safely lift.\u00a0\nFor example, a\u00a0Ford F-350 Super Duty\u00a0Diesel\u00a0might weigh\u00a0upwards of 7700lbs. Many jacks are rated for 2 tons, and these\u00a02 ton\u00a0jacks would not be sufficient for such a large pickup truck.\u00a0Jack stands are rated in pairs, so if you have jack stands rated for\u00a02\u00a0tons, each one will only hold\u00a01\u00a0ton on\u00a0it\u2019s\u00a0own.\u00a0\nMake\u00a0sure to completely understand your vehicles and their weights vs the equipment you plan on using.\nIn addition to specs like the weight rating, it\u2019s important to consider other aspects, like the width of the tires in comparison to the width of the ramps. A lot of modern sports cars and off-road vehicles have very wide tires, which could make them too wide for a narrow, old-fashioned ramp.\n\nConsider the Material\n\nRamps can be built with steel,\u00a0but most today are\u00a0made from a polymer.\u00a0Both\u00a0materials need to be properly cared for if they are to work right. Steel ramps can rust, which can decrease their structural integrity. Poly ramps can\u00a0crack and\u00a0be affected by chemicals or the weather\u00a0if they are left outside.\nIf you have any reason to question the integrity of a jack, jack stand, or ramp, don\u2019t use it and get one that you can trust. It\u2019s not worth risking it.\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "How to Clean and Organize Your Tools",
        "content": "How to Clean Large Rusty Tools\n\nCleaning large tools is a huge task in and of itself, and many of these tools are different in the ways that they are cleaned.\nWhat does that involve?\n\n1. Find the Work Space\n\nPlace the tool in a warm and dry location. This can be outside your workshop. \n\n2. Disassemble and Document\n\nDisassemble the tool to expose the corroded parts. If you are disassembling the tool for the first time, take photos at every step of the disassembly process to ensure you can put it back the way it was. Many times, bolts need to be soaked in penetrating oil for days before disassembly.\n\n3. Dust\n\nUse compressed air to clean out the inner parts, such as motors, that are not corroded yet but are dusty.\n\n4. Start Removing Rust\n\nYou can use a commercial rust remover such as Metal Rescue to clean smaller parts, whereas larger parts often will need to be media blasted, or wire-wheeled to clean rust and old paint. A cup brush on a variable speed drill will also do the trick.\n\n5. When You Need to Be Precise\n\nWhen restoring flat metal surfaces that need to be precise, like a table saw deck or drill press, using a sanding disc with 220 grit sandpaper and penetrating oil for lubricant works fantastic. It\u2019s messy, and you\u2019ll need to frequently spray, work, then wipe off the rusty oily access, but you are then left with a smooth, rust free surface.\n\n6. Reassemble and Test\n\nAssemble the parts and tune and align the tool so that it is back in working order. Test the functioning of the machine and do more tuning if necessary.\n\nCorroded and Rusty Hand Tools\n\nLike large tools, hand tools also corrode if they are not used for a while, so it\u2019s important to learn how to get the rust off of tools of all sizes, and keep it off. The steel parts of tools are always prone to corrosion, and wooden handles rot and sometimes fall off. You can remove the rust and get the tool back into shape using the steps below.\n\nHow to Clean Rusty Hand Tools\n\n1. Remove Handle (If Applicable)\n\nIf the tool had a wooden handle, remove what is left of the handle. You can do that by cutting off the handle and then knocking off the bit that remains using a hammer while the tool is clamped in a vise.\n\n2. Soak the Tool, or Use Rust Remover\n\nSoak the tool in white vinegar for four hours so that the vinegar dissolves the rust and makes it easy to remove. Again, a commercial rust remover like Metal Rescue works fantastic here. If you use the remover, follow the directions from the manufacturer.\n\n3. If The Tool is Really Stuck\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with a seized tool (usually a pair of pliers or wire cutters), a great method to get the tool working is to take a large, 1 gallon Zip-lock style bag and place the tool inside the bag. Flood the tool with a penetrating oil like WD40 or PB Blaster. Zip the bag, and set the tool aside in an old bucket or waste oil container in case it leaks. Every day, check the tool\u2019s ability to move by working it back and forth (sometimes you can even do this through the bag) and spray more lubricant on it if necessary. The bag acts to keep all the lubricant close to the tool and prevents it from drying or running off. Usually after several days, the tool will work itself free.\n\n4. Remove Rust and Buff\n\nSteel wool works excellent for a final buffing and final rust removal. The steel wool buffs the tool to leave it shiny and smooth.\n\n5. Rinse and Dry\n\nRinse the tool in clean water to remove the commercial rust remover or the white vinegar from the tool. Wipe the tool dry.\n\n6. Smoothing it Out\n\nAfter all the rust is gone, some tools will still show severe pitting. You can use a disc sander with a 100-grit sander to smooth the tool, then work up to 150 and 220.\n\n7. Lubricate Joints\n\nNext, any joints in the tool (like pliers or cutters) need to be properly lubricated with WD40 or 3-in-1 oil. Let them soak and work them back and forth to get the oil to penetrate. If you chose to prime and paint the tool, do this before any final lubrication.\n\n8. Fit a New Handle (If Applicable)\n\nIf your tool had a handle that\u2019s been removed, fit a new handle.\n\n9. Prevent Future Rust\n\nFinally, the most important piece is prevention of future rust. In this case, penetrating oil like WD40 works fantastic to keep your tools properly oiled and maintained every few months. Spray the tool down, then wipe off the excess. This layer will help resist moisture, which then turns into corrosion.\n\nMaintaining Your Tools\n\nTools lead a pretty thankless existence. They are expected to do exactly what they are designed to do every time, and for most folks, they are simply tossed back into the tool box, cabinet, or shelf without much thought after the task is done. Maintaining your tools is a simple process \u2013 follow these steps below.\n\nAny tools with bare metal parts that are not chromed need to be properly lubricated once every few months. WD40 or penetrating oil should be sprayed on the tool, and gently wipe off the excess.\nAny tools with joints (like pliers) need their joints lubricated. A drop or 2 of 3-in-1 oil will keep these joints properly lubricated. If you have a vise on your workbench, open it all the way up, spray the drive down with lubricant, and close it back up.\nAny flat, deck surfaces, like table saw decks, should be sprayed down with WD40 and gently wipe the excess off. This will keep a thin layer of oil on the metal deck and keep corrosion at bay.\nAny tooling with a motor will collect dust over time. Take compressed air with a blow-gun and find the cooling vents or ducts on the motor. Blow compressed air through these, which will force any dust or dirt out.\nCertain motorized tools like Air Compressors and Canister Vacuums have air filters. Don\u2019t neglect them!\nMany small tools use batteries of various sizes, from 9V on down to small micro-batteries. A good practice is to take inventory of all the different batteries your tools use and the respective part numbers. Always keep ample inventory of each type of battery on hand. Nothing is worse than needing a specific tool, like a Multimeter for example, only to find out the battery is dead and you don\u2019t have a replacement on-hand.\n\nHow to Organize Your Tools\n\nBefore you learn how to organize tools, you need to learn how to store them. You should always clean and dry your tools before storage and if you live in areas of high-humidity or temperature change, keep them properly oiled. While your garage or basement is the perfect place for the tools, these areas tend to be humid. If such is the case with your garage, consider investing in a dehumidifier, or in the summertime, a small A/C unit will also keep the humidity out, and make it more pleasant to work in during the hot summer months.\nYour garden tools should hang on the side walls as moisture can get to them from a concrete floor. For power tools, consider storing them in their original cases. Any tools stored in a cabinet, consider that you can always use desiccant, or silica gel to absorb moisture near the tools.\nThere are different ways to organize your tools:\n\nPegboard or slatboard wall organizer\nWall-mounted containers and baskets\nWall bars with pegs and hooks\nMobile workbench for tools you use often\nHooks to hang tools in a cabinet\nJars or stackable trays for storing bolts and nuts\nPlier racks to store pliers upright and save space\nSocket trays to keep your sockets upright and organized\n\nEven if you do not have a garage, a wall in your basement or shed will accommodate most tools.\nWhile taking care of your tools, do not neglect the toolboxes, cabinets, bags, belts, and cases. Empty these storage spaces and clean them according to their materials. Ensure that the storage is dry before you place your tools in them. If you only use your tools in summer, occasionally check on them, wipe the dust, and make sure moisture does not settle on them.",

        "title": "12 Must Have Tools for Every DIYer",
        "content": "Must Have Tools for DIYers\n\n1. OEM 3/8\u201d Mighty Compact Drive Impact Wrench (24411)\n\nThere\u2019s a good percentage of DIY\u2019ers that use some form of a pneumatic impact wrench \u2013 usually a full-size, 1/2\u201d impact to bust loose lug nuts or other big jobs. The OEM 24411 is an amazing variant of the \u201ccompact\u201d or \u201cmicro\u201d impact wrenches that hit the market several years ago. Super small in size, this impact still packs a ton of gusto at 250-300lbs of loosening (or tightening) power. It\u2019s small, lightweight, fits in tight corners, and is a super handy tool for saving time constantly using the hand-ratchet. Also, at the near-$100.00 price point, it\u2019s very affordable for a quality pneumatic impact.\n\n2. Chain Wrench (DL PN 56-630)\n\nYou won\u2019t know you need a chain wrench until you are trying to take off an oversize plumbing fitting, oil filter that won\u2019t budge, or trying to gain leverage on something large. Chain wrenches grip, and they won\u2019t let go! Plus, the length of chain allows you to fit around large fittings or objects you either wish to move, or keep from turning by holding steady with the wrench. The Duralast 56-630 is a fantastic tool to have in your arsenal.\n\n3. Knipex Wire Cutters (Knipex PN KNP7401200)\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about owning a set of wire cutters \u2013 just about any toolbox contains something that can cut wires. This is about owning THE set of wire cutters. Simply put, Knipex makes pretty much the best pliers and cutters in the industry. Made in Germany, you can search youtube for tons of videos of Knipex cutters cutting nearly anything. Having a good set of wire cutters that cut quick, easy, and less fatigue on your hands is a must. The KN7401200 aren\u2019t cheap, but you absolutely get what you pay for.\n\n4. Multimeter (Great Neck ESI480A)\n\nA multimeter may sound simple to most mechanics, but you\u2019d be surprised how many folks either don\u2019t have one, don\u2019t know how to operate one, or have one that doesn\u2019t function properly. A multi-meter even for the very average DIY\u2019er can check a battery, check voltage when troubleshooting basic wiring, and even be used in the house doing AC electrical work. Purchasing a quality multi-meter that can perform all AC and DC functions is a must-have. The ESI480A fits that bill, and will test AC, DC, and Continuity, which is what you want. If you\u2019re unsure exactly how to use a multimeter properly, or all its features, there are a multitude of Youtube videos that you can learn from.\n\n5. Snap Ring Pliers (OEM 25012)\n\nYou won\u2019t realize you need snap ring pliers until you are suddenly faced with removing a snap ring, often times when doing a brake job on a 4WD truck. Without them, you are stuck hoping a pair of screwdrivers or picks will do the trick, as you launch the snap ring 20 feet to the other side of the garage to disappear forever. Invest in a good set of snap ring pliers like OEM 25012. You won\u2019t use them often, but when do, there is no other way around getting them off and on.\n\n6. Hose Pinchers (OEM 25250)\n\nAt some point in time, you\u2019ve had to remove a fuel line, oil or hydraulic, or coolant line, only to find out that overnight while your work was sitting, that line was oozing liquid all over the garage floor, or worse, all over the engine compartment. These OEM Hose Pinchers go over the hose and block off flow, keeping things where they should be and saving you the trouble of fluid slowly leaking everywhere. Sure, you can use a pair of vice grips, but the rough edge of the grip jaws can often damage the hose.\n\n7. Torque Wrench  (DL 51-220) or (OEM 25686)\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you should have every time you take a wheel off and put it back on, it\u2019s a torque wrench. They are not just for precise engine and machine work. Torque wrenches guarantee that nuts and bolts have one thing \u2013 consistency. Most lug nuts, depending on vehicle, should be torqued between 85 and 95 ft-lbs. If they are torqued under, you run a risk of nuts loosening, and worse, a wheel-off. If you torque too tight by using your favorite impact to blast the nut to 400 ft-lbs, you risk never getting it back off next time, or worse yet, when you are on the road with a flat tire. Even if just buying a torque wrench for lug-nut work, it\u2019s worth it. You want to stick with a \u00bd\u201d size to get you higher torque readings for lug nuts, which you\u2019re bound to use the tool more often than anything for.\nBoth the 1/2\u2033 Duralast 51-220 and the 3/8\u2033 OEM 25686 can be solid choices, depending on what size you need.\n\n8. Digital Torque Adapter 3/8\u201d (OEM 25684)\n\nWhen it comes to small torque readings you need to achieve, whether it be 10 ft-lbs, or something in inch-pounds, often times a mechanical torque wrench is not the best answer. Digital Torque adapters like the OEM 25684 are fairly new, but their reviews are great and their usage is quickly growing. These devices go directly in between your ratchet and your socket, and/or extensions. They give a digital measure of the torque you are applying, and also have an alarm setting to indicate when you have reached the desired torque. Now, if the OE says your oil pan bolts need to be torqued to 7 ft-lbs on your car \u2013 you can do it easily! It\u2019s a fantastic tool\n\n9. Hook and Pick Set (OEM 25940)\n\nYou quickly realize that you need a hook and pick set when you don\u2019t have one. When sourcing one, it\u2019s a good idea to get a heavy duty set like the OEM 25940 that will withstand the test of time. From removing pesky o-rings,  grabbing small parts (think carburetor rebuild), interior and electrical work, a hook and pick set will be used for a multitude of other small jobs and functions that otherwise would force you to use tools like screwdrivers, or making your own make-shift tools that never work as well.\n\n10. Test Extension Wires (Dorman 84610)\n\nIn the world of automotive and 12V electrical, having a handy pair of test wires or test leads is a far cry better that some tangled birds-nest of old speaker wire that you use to test stuff. These handy Test Extension wires from Dorman come in a 10 foot retractable spool, with 2 sets of wires \u2013 4 clips, and a magnetic back to stick in the engine compartment, on your toolbox, etc. They roll up easily and provide an endless possibility of troubleshooting what you need to test off voltage, continuity, etc.\n\n11. Test Light (Innova 3410)\n\nWhen it comes to simplicity in electrical troubleshooting, sometimes a test light like the Innova 3410 is the way to go. Clip off to ground, and use the pointed probe to check voltage at connectors, wire ends, or even use the probe to pierce through wiring insulation to check voltage. Pro-tip \u2013 don\u2019t stab your finger while doing this as many of us have! If you\u2019ve got DC voltage at the wire or connector you\u2019re testing, the light will glow \u2013 it\u2019s as simple as that. Couple the test light with the Dorman test leads and a multimeter, and you are an unstoppable force for troubleshooting electrical!\n\n12. Spark Plug Socket Set (DL 62-130) and (DL 62-135)\n\nWhile this one may seem all too easy, it\u2019s amazing how many folks change spark plugs with a standard deep-well socket.\n\nIt\u2019s good to buy a spark plug socket set like Duralast 62-130 or 62-135, but also to look at some of the odd sizes that your small equipment can have on it. Some small equipment now use the 14MM socket, so it\u2019s important to check all the sizes you may use and plan accordingly!\n\nThese are our picks for must have tools, but if you\u2019d like some more variety, check out our full selection of our tools online or in one of our stores.\n\nFind an AutoZone Near You",

        "title": "What Is a Car Battery Trickle Charger?",
        "content": "Trickle Chargers: What Are They and\u00a0How Do They Work?\n\nSo,\u202fwhat is a trickle charger and how do trickle chargers work? In essence, a trickle charger is a special type of battery charger designed to replenish a vehicle battery at a very low, slow rate. (The slow, gradual charging speed is actually why they\u2019re called \u201ctrickle\u201d chargers in the first place.) In most cases, the charge rate is about equal to the battery\u2019s natural rate of self-discharge. This makes it possible to leave the battery connected to the charger on a long-term basis, as there\u2019s little to no chance of it actually overcharging the battery and damaging it in the process. Other benefits of the \u201cslow and steady\u201d trickle charge approach to battery maintenance include:\n\nA better, more thorough charge that you can really trust\nA longer, more efficient lifespan for your battery\nA much more convenient way to keep your battery road-ready when your vehicles aren\u2019t in use\n\nFor best results, invest in a trickle charger that automatically self-regulates and goes into float mode once your battery is fully charged. If yours does not do this, you will definitely want to keep an eye on the process to make sure your battery doesn\u2019t wind up\u202fovercharged.\n\nTrickle Chargers as\u00a0Compared to Other Charge Methods\n\nOf course, trickle chargers aren\u2019t the only ways to keep a battery charged up and ready to go. That said, is it the\u202fbest\u202fway or simply something that\u2019s nice to have on hand? How does it stack up against other more commonly used ways to keep a battery charged or replenish a battery\u2019s charge from scratch once it\u2019s nearly been depleted? Here\u2019s a closer look at the answers to all of those questions and more.\n\nIf you already have a standard battery charger, you may be wondering why you can\u2019t just go ahead and use that to keep your batteries full. The answer is that you can, but it truly isn\u2019t what\u2019s best for the battery. Faster isn\u2019t always better and this is definitely an instance where that would be the case, as the faster the charge, the harder the process is on the battery. You don\u2019t want to use a standard charger on a long-term unattended basis at all,\u202fas it can be extremely dangerous. The battery can actually overheat and even explode.\nJumping your battery\u00a0to get it started is actually the hardest on its integrity, so it\u2019s something to refrain from unless it\u2019s an absolute emergency. It\u2019s definitely not a process to subject your batteries to as a rule.\nSimply making it a point to start your vehicles and drive them around every so often\u202fseems\u202flike an easy solution, so long as you have the time and patience to work it into your schedule. However, your vehicle\u2019s alternator doesn\u2019t actually put out much of a charge. Driving around the block a time or two definitely isn\u2019t enough to keep your battery fully charged, so you\u2019re likely not replenishing it to the extent most people think they are.\nYou can always drop your vehicle off at your favorite body shop for the day and have a mechanic handle the task of fully charging your battery. However, this isn\u2019t a convenient or cost-effective solution for most people.\n\nAt the end of the day, the right trickle charger can really take a lot of the guesswork out of keeping idle batteries fully charged. It\u2019s safer, it\u2019s more efficient, and it\u2019s a lot more convenient than many of the alternatives. It\u2019s also a much better solution for people who really need to be able to \u201cset it and forget it\u201d for the most part when it comes to managing stored vehicles or seasonal rides.\n\nMore Battery\u00a0Maintenance Tips To Know\n\nUsing the right charger is a good start when it comes to taking care of your batteries, but it\u2019s not the only thing you can do to maintain a battery\u2019s integrity, especially during charging. Always make sure your car battery\u2019s caps are in place before charging. Make sure your battery and the space around it is clear of any metal objects or materials before beginning the charging process. In the event there\u2019s a short, you don\u2019t want any sparks to be generated, as they\u2019re a fire hazard. You\u2019ll also want to refrain from wearing metal bracelets or rings while connecting or disconnecting a battery, as you can sustain burns.\n\nShop Car Battery Trickle Chargers",

        "title": "How To Gap Spark Plugs",
        "content": "When replacing your spark plugs, your choice of gapping tool matters. Those coin-style gap tools may not always be the best option. While those tools are OK for traditional copper/nickel spark plugs, many plug manufacturers have moved towards precious metals. These precious metals, such as platinum, iridium, and ruthenium, are harder than their copper/nickel counterparts which allows the center electrode design to be smaller, typically under 1 mmm in diameter. These precious metal tips are more resistant to wear and have a higher melting point than the larger copper/nickel tips, but they are more fragile, especially when gapping. Any lateral force applied to the tiny center electrode could cause the tip to break off. Therefore, before you go using a coin gapper on any spark plug, make sure you understand how it works and why a precise gap matters.\nWhy Gapping Matters\n\nThe distance of the gap on a spark plug depends on the voltage and amperage generated by the ignition coil. The gap specification is determined by the vehicle manufacturer during engine design and is commonly found in the vehicle owner\u2019s manual or the emission sticker under the hood. The accuracy of the gap is critical to an engine\u2019s operation and efficiency. However, let\u2019s further explain for those asking, \u201cwhat happens when plugs aren\u2019t gapped properly?\u201d\nSpark plugs that do not have the proper gap lead to premature wear, ignition system stress, and even cylinder misfires. If the gap is too wide the ignition system components are required to work harder to jump across the extended gap leading to spark plug, ignition coil, and control module failures. It\u2019s also possible the spark could be \u201cblown out\u201d in highly turbulent combustion chambers. A gap that is too small will not fully ignite the air/fuel mixture leading to low power and higher tailpipe emissions.\n\nCheck Pre-Gapped Plugs\n\nPre-gapped spark plugs often create a little confusion or over-confidence. While it is true that many spark plug manufacturers will say that their plugs are indeed pre-gapped, that does not necessarily mean that the plugs are gapped for your specific engine or vehicle. Pre-gapped only means that the device is pre-measured to work in a variety of engines. Therefore, always measure the gap to ensure maximum efficiency and longevity of the plug in your specific engine.\nThere are a few types of gapping tools you can use.\n\nUsing a Feeler Gauge or Wire-Type Gap Gauge\n\nNewer spark plugs, those designed with precious metals, should only be manipulated with a feeler or wire-type gap gauge. While a coin-style tool can be used in a pinch, albeit cautiously, it is far too easy to damage the iridium or platinum metals, which decreases the lifespan of the plug. Also, wire and feeler gauge tools provide a more accurate measurement than coin-style devices because they are designed with a linear surface. Additionally, the linear advantage of these tools provides a way to check the squareness and thickness of the gap, which is difficult with the coin tool. Beyond more accurate measuring, these tools also have a better mechanism for expanding the gap than found in coin-style gauges.\n\nHow to Use a Coin-Style Gap Tool\n\nCoin-style gap tools are some of the most common and readily available tools on the market. However, not everyone understands how to use these devices properly, and not every spark plug is designed with this type of tool in mind. Therefore, you will want to locate in your car\u2019s manual the type of spark plug you should be using. If the plug uses precious metals, like iridium, platinum, or ruthenium, then you want to avoid using a coin-style gapper, but if your vehicle uses copper/nickel plugs, then this tool is fine. Although you must use it correctly.\n\n1. Insert ramp between electrodes\n\nThe coin tool has a little ramp going around its perimeter that is labeled with measurements. You want to place the narrowest end of the slope between the electrodes of the plug and slowly rotate until you feel a slight resistance. Then, stop. Look at the measurement to determine the current gap.\n\n2. If Too Wide\n\nIf the measurement that is revealed is too wide for your engine, then you need to decrease the gap. Thankfully, this is not difficult. Tap the gapped side of the plug against a hard surface gently. If you do this too hard, you can damage the porcelain or the insulator.\n\n3. If Too Narrow\n\nThis is when most people make a mistake and use the ramp to widen the gap. Don\u2019t do that. The ramp is only used to measure the gap, nothing else. The appropriate way to widen the gap with the coin tool is to use the predrilled hole. While it might appear to be a place for a key ring, the hole is actually an opening for inserting the ground electrode. Inside of the whole is a lip or edge, which is called the gapper. Hook the ground electrode onto the rim and pry the gap open with the tool. However, be gentle so that you don\u2019t damage the integrity of the plug.\n\n4. Remeasure and Adjust\n\nBe sure to check the gap frequently while making these minor adjustments. A little pressure goes a long way, and if you are not careful, you might adjust too much and weaken the ground electrode strap. Tap or pry a little, and then measure. It is better to work incrementally than to try and force it in one maneuver.",

        "title": "The Tools Needed To Change Spark Plugs",
        "content": "When To Change Your Vehicle\u2019s Spark Plugs\n\nWhether you are an automotive enthusiast or just prefer to avoid car trouble, occasionally replacing spark plugs is part of regular maintenance. Put simply, if you ignore your car\u2019s plugs, you are asking for trouble.\nSpark plug manufacturers design their products both to be durable and have a long life. You may not need to worry about your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs for 30,000 miles or more. Still, you should not forget to replace your spark plugs when the time comes.\nAn old, damaged, or ineffective spark plug may cause your vehicle\u2019s engine to misfire. Alternatively, old plugs can cause the emissions from your engine to increase. Even worse, a bad spark plug can leave you stranded somewhere you would rather not be.\n\nHow to Tell if Your Spark Plugs are Bad\n\nIf any of the following applies to your vehicle, it may be time for a change:\nYour owner\u2019s manual recommends changing spark plugsYour car\u2019s engine misfiresYour check engine light illuminatesYour car has difficulty startingYour car accelerates slowlyYour car\u2019s engine idles roughly\nLearn more about bad spark plug symptoms.\nWhile other problems and maintenance issues can cause the above situations to occur, spark plugs are often to blame. If changing your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs does not remedy your vehicle\u2019s engine problems, you may need to do some troubleshooting. Still, swapping out bad spark plugs often fixes issues with your vehicle\u2019s overall performance.\n\nHow To Choose the Right Spark Plug Tools\n\nOn most vehicles, replacing spark plugs is not a difficult project. In fact, you can likely do the job in just a couple hours on the weekend. Nevertheless, you need the right tools to replace spark plugs correctly. While you may run into problems, the following tools are often essential for achieving professional-grade results.\n\n1. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual\n\nBefore you can replace spark plugs, you need to know where to find them and how to access them. Your vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s manual is an excellent resource. If the manual does not shed sufficient light on the subject, you may want to invest in a vehicle-specific aftermarket manual. Chilton and Haynes have some excellent manuals that give you a step-by-step guide to locating and replacing spark plugs as well as a list of tools to replace spark plugs. \n\n2. A spark plug socket\n\nTo remove spark plugs, you need a spark plug removal tool that grabs and twists the spark plugs inside your vehicle\u2019s engine. Because spark plugs can be in awkward positions, you may also need an extension for your spark plug socket. Choosing one that locks in place may help you avoid the sort of aggravation that occasionally accompanies a spark plug replacement.\n\n3. A wobble socket\n\nIf a standard socket does not work, choosing a wobble socket may be a better idea. Wobble sockets are often essential equipment for removing iridium spark plugs. The wobble socket is also smaller than traditional spark plug sockets, allowing you to access tight spaces easier. If a regular socket simply does not fit into the confined area in which you must work, trying a wobble socket may be a better approach. \n\n4. Spark plug boot puller pliers\n\nOccasionally, spark plug boots fuse with your vehicle\u2019s plugs. If this is the case, you do not want to pull on the wires themselves. Doing so may damage the wires, potentially rendering them unusable after your spark plug replacement. Instead, use spark plug boot puller pliers to gently work boots free. \n\n5. A flexible handle ratchet\n\nSometimes you must be a bit creative to remove spark plugs. If your vehicle\u2019s engine configuration requires you to work in tight or bizarre places, using a flexible handle ratchet allows you to remove spark plugs without standing on your head. Using one in conjunction with a wobble socket may be the perfect solution for removing your vehicle\u2019s spark plugs from areas where space is a premium.  \n\n6. A torque wrench\n\nWhen replacing spark plugs, how much you tighten each plug matters. If you do not tighten plugs sufficiently, you risk a bad connection. Too much tightening, though, can destroy both your spark plugs and your engine. Therefore, use a torque wrench and manufacturer specifications to tighten each spark plug appropriately. \n\n7. A spark plug gap gauge\n\nYour new spark plugs need the correct gap to function optimally. Rather than estimating gap, use a spark plug gap gauge to space your new plugs perfectly. To correctly use the gap gauge, first consult manufacturer recommendations. Then, place the gauge between the plug\u2019s center and its electrodes, lining it up to meet manufacturer specifications.\n\nOther Things You May Need\n\nWhile these items are not necessary to every spark plug replacement, they  can certainly help:\nAnti-Seize Lubricant: If your plugs were really hard to remove, it might be because the previous installer didn\u2019t use an anti-seize product. When you apply this product to the spark plugs before installing them, you reduce the risk of having plugs fuse to engine parts. When using an anti-seize product, though, you likely need to reduce the torque by up to 10% on each plug. Spark Plug Wires: You may be able to reuse your existing spark plug wires after replacing old, damaged or ineffective plugs. Still, your plug wires are essential components. If you notice signs of wear and tear or other damage, replacing spark plug wires when you add new spark plugs is a good idea. Distributor Cap: This part only applies to vehicles that have distributors. Just as spark plugs and wires can wear out over time, your vehicle\u2019s distributor cap may not last forever. After replacing spark plugs and wires, inspect the distributor cap for signs of damage. If you see any, opt for a new distributor cap.\n\nAchieving Success \n\nReplacing bad spark plugs is probably a project you can tackle on a weekend. Before you do, though, you must be sure you have the tools needed to change spark plugs. With a bit of planning and the correct tools, you can achieve success.  \nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "content": "3 AC Tools to do the Complete Job\n\n1. Manifold Gauges Keep Tabs on Refrigerant Pressure\n\nManifold gauge sets are designed to measure pressure automotive air conditioning systems systems. They have three hoses: the blue hose connects to the low-pressure side of the system, the red hose connects to the high-pressure side, and the yellow hose connects to a refrigerant refill can.\nThe set can be used to refill a system that\u2019s gotten low on refrigerant, but these tools are more versatile than a simple recharge gauge like come attached on some cans of refrigerant, this gauge will only tell you the low-pressure. A manifold gauge set will measure both high- and low-side pressures, and you can compare these pressures to the pressures specified in the owner\u2019s manual or on our guide: How to Recharge AC. By measuring both sides of the system with precise gauges, the set can be used to test your system by reading the pressure of both sides of the system. \nToo much pressure on the high-side indicates too much refrigerant in the system, a restriction or air in the lines, or insufficient airflow at the condenser. Too little pressure on the high-side is often caused by low refrigerant levels or a bad compressor. Excess pressure on the low-side indicates too much refrigerant or a defective compressor. Insufficient low-side pressure means there is a restriction on the low-side of the system, or insufficient refrigerant or airflow across the condenser.\nThey can also test to ensure the system can maintain a vacuum. If the system cannot and pressure is decreasing, your system has a leak. It will also tell you how much vacuum the system can maintain should you decide to use a vacuum pump.\n\n2. Flush Kits Clean Out Your AC System\n\nAC flush kits use a special flushing liquid and compressed air to flush the system clean of debris and other contamination. Some components may not need replacing but will need to be flushed out to keep from contaminating the new components. It flushes everything except for the accumulator and compressor which should be disconnected before flushing. This allows it to clean out your evaporator, condenser, and AC system lines.\nThe kits must be filled with both a flushing solvent and compressed air. The air forces the solvent through the system to ensure that the whole system gets properly cleared of debris.\n\n3. Vacuum Pumps Remove Moisture and Check for Leaks\n\nUsing a vacuum pump is often overlooked when performing the complete job. Applying a vacuum for 45-60 minutes will accomplish two things: removing moisture and checking for leaks, setting up your repaired system for continued successful operation.\nThe ability of the system to reach and maintain a state of vacuum is a sign that the system should be leak free. If the system is unable to reach 29 in/Hg (inches of mercury, the unit of measurement used when measuring vacuum) of vacuum, or the vacuum fails as soon as the pump is turned off, a leak probably still exists in the system.\n\nGet the AC Tools You Need Through the\u00a0Loan-A-Tool\u00ae Program\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\nLearn more about\u00a0how car AC works\u00a0and some of the most\u00a0common AC problems.",

        "title": "What is a Torque Wrench and Why Your Toolbox Needs One",
        "content": "What is a\u00a0Torque Wrench?\n\nThe original torque wrench was invented by Conrad Bahr in 1918. It was designed initially to prevent the over-tightening of bolts that were installed on steam pipes and water mains used by the New York City Water Department. Today, the torque wrench comes in multiple forms, including both manually operated and electrically controlled versions. They are used to apply the exact torque pressure to fasten a bolt, screw, or other fastener. A mechanic will review the recommended torque pressure settings for each component as required by the manufacturer. When used correctly, a torque wrench permits the perfect tension, assembly, and loading of all parts. It reduces the potential of stripped bolts, damaged mechanical components, and enhances safety.\nMost automotive manufacturers recommend a specific torque pressure for individual systems that require a precision fit of force times distance \u2013 which is how torque is defined. While any and every avid mechanic has a torque wrench, or several in their arsenal \u2013 there is a need for the torque wrench in every DIYer\u2019s tool box. Some of the most common automotive systems that require the use of a torque wrench include:\n\nWHEELS\n\nAnytime you remove a wheel from the hub, the lug nuts or bolts need to receive a final tightening via a torque wrench. This by far is the #1 use for all DIYers to have a torque wrench in their tools. Different manufacturers have unique torque settings, but generally \u2013 they range from 76 lb-ft on aluminum studs to 150 lb-ft for high-grade steel, but generally, most vehicles wheel nut torque is between 80-95 lb-ft. \n*You can usually find the recommended torque pressure on the inside of the driver door on a placard that also lists the recommended tire air pressure.\n\nENGINE COMPONENTS\n\nA vehicle\u2019s engine is composed of a multitude of precision-fit parts. From the cylinder head and intake manifold, all the way down to connecting rod and main bearings, everything has an exact torque specification. The risk here is not just over- or under-tightening, but making sure there is perfect consistency across each fastener, like a cylinder head, that often has 10-20 bolts securing it down, and clamping the important head gasket between it and the engine block. When inconsistency between fasteners occur, the cylinder head components will warp, leading to excessive heat build-up, cracking, and eventually complete mechanical failure.\n\nSUSPENSION & BRAKE SYSTEM PARTS\n\nFrom calipers to struts to wheel hub nuts, every bolt or nut on a suspension and brake system should be torqued based on the manufacturer specs. If they are not torqued correctly, they can loosen since they move frequently. When this occurs, parts can fail while the vehicle is in motion.\n\nWhy is it Important to Use a Torque Wrench?\n\nIf the nuts and bolts that secure a replacement part or mechanical system has a required torque pressure, a torque wrench is required for multiple reasons. In most cases, when we attempt to tighten fasteners with an impact wrench or manual wrench/ratchet \u2013 two things will happen.\n\nFASTENERS WILL BE TOO LOOSE\n\nIf the fastener is too loose, it can create a gap between the nut or bolt, and the part it is securing. When this happens, excessive heat is built-up, which loosens the fastener to the point the bolt snaps or the part falls off. With wheels and steering/braking components, this can cause an accident and even fatalities.\n\nFASTENERS WILL BE TOO TIGHT\n\nMost DIY mechanics don\u2019t realize how strong they are. In fact, over-tightening is more common than leaving fasteners too loose. When they are too tight, the danger comes in the form of too much force, which typically warps, bends or damages the bolts and the part itself.\n\nGeneral Torque Wrench Tips\n\nAnytime you complete a service on your car, truck, SUV or other vehicle, it\u2019s always best to refer to a vehicle\u2019s service and repair manual. This guide will not only provide you with steps for completing the routine service or parts replacement, but it will also give you the recommended torque pressure and torque pressure pattern. Here are a few general tips for using a torque wrench:\n\nCLEAN ALL BOLTS AND FASTENERS BEFORE INSTALLATION\n\nIt\u2019s always best to remove rust, dirt, and debris from any fastener before you install. If you have excessive rust build-up, use a wire brush to completely clean the fastener\u2019s threads. Use a thread chaser to clean a bolt hole, especially if rust or baked on grease is present. This is especially important on engine components. Many engine component bolts require lubing either the threads, or the bolt head with engine oil or a dab of grease before torquing. Consult your car\u2019s manual to check if this applies to the bolts you are torquing!\n\nSET THE TORQUE WRENCH TO THE RECOMMENDED PRESSURE\n\nIn the service manual you\u2019ll see a recommended torque pressure. The bottom of the torque wrench has a series of numbers that indicate the pressure setting. Follow the torque wrench setting procedures as each torque wrench is unique and has different steps.\n\nTIGHTEN COMPONENTS IN TWO STEPS\n\nGuide the nut or bolt onto the part using a hand wrench until it is snug, but not tight. At this point, use a torque wrench by setting it to the recommended torque pressure. You\u2019ll pull the torque wrench in tightening direction until you hear a \u201cclick\u201d in the handle of the wrench. Stop at this point and tighten once more until you hear the \u201cclick\u201d again.\u202f The second click confirms your torque setting.",

        "title": "How to Remove a Rusted Bolt",
        "content": "Removing a Rusted Bolt\n\n1. Time is on Your Side\n\nUnlike a professional mechanic who has to deal with a rusted fastener as soon as he raises the vehicle on the lift, as a DIYer, time is on your side. Don\u2019t wait until the day that you\u2019re planning to swap out pads and rotors to check and see if nuts and bolts are rusted in place. Instead, do a pre-inspection a few days before you\u2019re planning the work. If you spot fasteners that look like they\u2019ll be trouble, give them a treatment of quality penetrating oil so that the oil has time to work to dissolve the rust, and, well, make the job a great deal easier.\n\n2. Remove as much Rust as Possible\n\nIf you\u2019re able to reach the area, you should actually make this your first step. But since getting a vehicle into the garage, jacking it up, and removing the wheels to inspect the brake calipers isn\u2019t your idea of a fun evening, you will most likely take this step when you\u2019re ready to start work. Getting all the rust off the fasteners has two purposes: one is that it gives you a flatter, more accurate surface to match up to your tools, and second it starts to break the hold the rust has on the fasteners \u2013 less rust means less force required to free the nut or bolt.\n\n3. Always Use the Right Tools\n\nThere\u2019s no operation on your vehicle that\u2019s more critical for you to have the correct tools at the ready than when freeing frozen or rusted bolts. Believe it or not, one technician told us he sees way more DIYers bring their vehicles into their shops with rusted bolts where they\u2019ve rounded off the head because they were using the wrong tool. First, all types of pliers are out as are adjustable wrenches. The same goes for open wrenches. Don\u2019t even try. The best way to grab the nut or bolt securely is with a socket. A 6 point is good but a 12 point is better as there\u2019s more surface contact area, and less likelihood of slipping. Don\u2019t use a ratchet unless you like to return tools. They\u2019re not designed for high levels of torque. Instead, invest in a breaker bar, if you don\u2019t already have one. The length of the lever is two to three times longer than a ratchet, delivering a much higher level of torque to the fastener.\n\n4. Is It Thread Locker Holding You Back?\n\nLook carefully at the bolt and see if you can spot a tiny bit of thread locking compound that may have leaked past the nut. To keep squeaks and rattles to a minimum, many carmakers are using threadlocking compound on fasteners used throughout the body and chassis. If the thread locker used is the permanent type, it\u2019s one thing, but when the fasteners are also rusted that\u2019s double trouble. First, follow the steps above, then add some heat from a torch to liquefy the threadlocker and soften the rust. Use caution with heat around electrical components and flammable liquids.\n\n5. Backwards and Forwards\n\nLike most DIY\u2019ers you probably don\u2019t have a lift in your garage, so you can work under your vehicle standing up. Like most of us, you\u2019re rolling around on a creeper under a vehicle well-supported by jack stands of a sufficient rating. In this environment, it\u2019s easy to get a little confused, especially if you\u2019re working on the backside of a fastener. Before you start turning a wrench in that situation, make sure you\u2019re going to be spinning it in the correct direction to loosen it.\nThe next issue is that once you get the bolt or nut to turn, don\u2019t immediately assume you\u2019re out of the woods. Often times, especially on nuts, rusty corrosion will jam into the nut or bolt while you are loosening, making it difficult to turn even once it\u2019s been broken loose, and gets worse the more you turn the bolt. Often times, this leads to a busted bolt, or stud, and a very frustrating time. The remedy to this is to work the bolt/nut just like you would a tap \u2013 backwards and forwards. Once you get it broke loose, spray a little penetrating oil on it and go 1/4 turn forward, and 1/8 back. 1/4 forward again, and 1/8 back. Repeat over and over again, until the bolt/nut can easily be loosened without resistance the rest of the way. This is especially important on exhaust nuts and bolts. The moment you feel resistance \u2013 stop! Tighten up slightly, and then go back to reversing again. Be patient. You will save a lifetime worth of bolt-breakage frustration using this method.\n\n6. Heat is Your Friend\n\nJust like science tells us, heat causes things to expand. Applying a heat source, usually in the form of a torch \u2013 propane, MAP gas, or Acetylene, will expand the nut and make breaking it loose easier. Sometimes, a bolt/nut cannot budge unless heat is applied to it. While Propane torches will heat, they will not get the nut/bolt red hot like MAP gas or Acetylene will, and sometimes, you need that much. Take extra care to always make sure with any heat or flame source that there is no rubber, wiring, grease, or fuel lines around where you were working. Always size up the situation around where you are working for any hazards, and always have a fire extinguisher handy and at your side whenever working with any flame.\n\n7. Bring in the Big Guns\n\nA pneumatic or electric impact gun can be used, but many times it\u2019s not practical in the area you\u2019re working. As you\u2019re aware, these aren\u2019t subtle tools that can transmit information back to the DIYer about whether the bolt may fail, whereas the \u201cbackwards and forwards\u201d method listed above, you always can feel for that resistance if something is jamming the bolt/nut up from coming off. The chances are good that something is going to break when you apply enough brute force to a rusted fastener, so try to limit using an impact on anything smaller than 5/8 socket size, as often times an impact will simply shear this bolt off. Last thing you want to do is have to drill and tap, or use a bolt extractor to remove a busted fastener.",

        "title": "How Much Does It Cost to Lift a Truck?",
        "content": "Types of Truck Lifts\n\nGenerally, there are three different directions you can take for a truck lift. Not only will they have different appearances, but how your truck performs is also affected.\n\nSuspension Lift Kits\n\nSuspension lift kits are the real deal when it comes to lifting your truck for better ground clearance and off-road performance. They replace shocks, springs, and other suspension components to elevate your vehicle significantly. A mild kit would include a lift of between .5 and 2 inches in height. A larger lift of between 4 and 6 inches is still common, although it can come with more difficulty during installation because of changes to the pinion angle and other geometries. Greater lift heights are also available of 8 inches and even more.\nIt\u2019s the option to choose to gain ground clearance, increasing the clearance by lift height. If you install a 4-inch lift, you gain 4 inches of ground clearance.\n\nBody Lift Options\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a cheaper, less intensive way to raise your truck, body lifts are the answer. This method includes spacers and blocks to lift the body away from the chassis without major alterations to the suspension.\nAlthough the looks are improved and larger tires can often be installed, a body lift itself doesn\u2019t increase your ground clearance since the chassis isn\u2019t getting any higher from the ground.\n\nLeveling Kits and Their Purpose\n\nFor those who don\u2019t need a significant lift but want to balance out the truck\u2019s stature, leveling kits are ideal. They offer a minor lift, primarily for the front of the truck, to even out the factory rake. It can include adjusting or replacing the torsion bar keys or adding spacers to the front springs, and seldom much more.\n\nFactors Influencing Costs\n\nNot all lift kits are created equal, so what goes into how much it is to lift a truck? These factors could be:\n\nQuality of lift kit components. Higher quality usually comes with higher costs, but it can mean better vehicle performance and lifespan. Certain trusted brand names command a higher price, and for good reason. The higher the quality, the less service and repairs you typically require down the road. As well, they often have a more complete kit than other lesser-known or budget-focused kits.\nThe lift height. Although not a rule, higher lifts tend to be more expensive. That\u2019s because additional components may be needed compared to smaller lifts, such as shock absorbers, control arms, and the like.\nThe installation. Whether you install the kit yourself or have a pro do it will certainly affect your final cost. Professional installation guarantees expertise but at a price, and along with the installation, you\u2019ll need a wheel alignment too. DIY can save money if you have the skills and tools, although a professional alignment afterward is still a good plan.\nAdditional customization. Things like larger tires, which are often paired with lift kits, can add to the total expense, as can any additional custom work like fender flares or beefed-up axles.\n\nPopular Truck Models and Associated Costs\n\nEvery truck is different, and so is the cost to lift it. For instance, lifting a full-size Ford F-150 will vary in price compared to a mid-sized Chevy Colorado. Here are some rough guidelines for what you can expect:\n\nA 2-inch lift for full-size pickup trucks. For pickups like the Chevy Silverado 1500, Ram 1500, Toyota Tundra, and Ford F-150, a suspension lift kit can average around $1,200 in parts. Installation can easily be $600 to $800, for a total nearing $2,000.\nA 2-inch lift for HD trucks. With heavier-duty components and less availability, a 2-inch lift for \u00be ton and 1-ton models can be more expensive. Expect a cost of between $2,500 and $3,500 for an average kit, installed.\nA 2-inch lift for mid-size pickup trucks. Thanks to slightly lighter-duty parts, a lift kit for mid-size pickup trucks can keep costs a little lower in many cases. Expect an average of around $1,500, although premium kits can be quite a bit higher.\n\nHidden Costs and Maintenance\n\nThere\u2019s more to lifting a truck than the initial investment. Hidden costs can crawl out of nowhere \u2013 alignment issues, steering modifications, or axle changes. Plus, those heavier-duty shocks may need to be replaced more often because you\u2019re working them harder than your stock truck.\n\nNo matter which type of vehicle you have, a wheel alignment will add another $100 to $150 to the final price.\nFor larger lifts, the steering column might need to be adjusted so it doesn\u2019t bind, and costs can be an extra few hundred dollars.\nAxle pinion angle adjustments take time and expertise, potentially doubling the cost of a wheel alignment.\nWhen you need to replace your shocks down the road, you don\u2019t have as many options available, and they\u2019re more expensive than budget-friendly parts.\n\nDon\u2019t assume your maintenance costs will stay the same with a lift kit installed \u2013 they will increase.\n\nDIY vs. Professional Installation\n\nDIY is cost-effective and gratifying but be warned\u2014it requires skill and tools. One wrong move could set you back more than you intended to save. It might be pricey, but going pro offers peace of mind and assured quality\u2014ideal for those who value time over tinkering.\nWeigh your wallet and your confidence. Your skills might save you as much as $1,000, but a mistake could cost more than a pro\u2019s touch, not including downtime while you wait for replacement parts.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Best Truck Bed Liners",
        "content": "Introduction to Truck Bed Liners\n\nUnlike a carpeted trunk or hatch area, truck beds are reinforced painted metal \u2013 either steel or aluminum. And even a suitcase tossed unceremoniously into the truck bed can gouge or dent it. Imagine how bad the bed would look after loading and shoveling out a single load of topsoil, with the shovel\u2019s edge scraping against the paint.\nA truck bed liner protects against corrosion on metal that\u2019s had its paint scratched off, reduces the instances of dents by adding a cushioning layer, and improves appearances with its rugged look. In some cases, deep channels also help water drain out of the truck bed, and textured surfaces can prevent your cargo from sliding around.\u202f\n\nTypes of Truck Bed Liners\n\nGenerally speaking, there are three types of truck bed liners you\u2019ll have to choose from. Each has a distinctly different style and offers its own pros and cons:\n\nDrop-in box liners are common accessories found on trucks purchased from dealerships. They\u2019re usually two pieces \u2013 a main section for the truck bed and inner box sides and a tailgate liner. These can be underrail, offering a cleaner look that doesn\u2019t interfere using the top of the bed rail for other mounts, or they can be overrail, protecting the top of the bed rail from abrasion and dents too. They\u2019re easily replaced if they become too damaged or warped. They aren\u2019t the most appealing looks-wise.\nSpray-on bed liners are a fast-growing add-on in terms of popularity that can be professionally applied or done by a DIYer. They adhere very well to the bed when they\u2019re done properly, and they\u2019re usually textured to keep cargo from moving around. If it becomes chipped or gouged, it can be touched up, but replacing it is extremely tough.\nBed mats are even easier a solution since they simply lay on the truck bed. These flexible mats are less expensive, but they offer limited protection since the sides aren\u2019t covered and they aren\u2019t rigid. But they can be rolled up and replaced in seconds if it gets damaged.\u202f\n\nMaterials for Truck Bed Liners\n\nBed liner materials can vary extensively. Your typical drop-in bedliner is a heavy-duty polyethylene composite, and it maintains its rigidity even if you carry extremely heavy loads. But there are other materials to choose from too.\nIf you\u2019re interested in the simplicity of a truck bed mat, it\u2019s likely to be made of a high-density rubber compound, often reinforced with fibers to keep it from becoming deformed, scuffing too easily, or tearing.\nSpray-on bed liners, on the other hand, begin as a liquid and harden onto the bed. It\u2019s a specially blended urethane coating that\u2019s aerosolized and sprayed onto the bed. In about 24 hours, it\u2019s dry.\nIt\u2019s up to you to decide which bed liner materials are attractive to you and your purposes.\n\nTop Truck Bed Liners on the Market\n\nHerculiner Professional Grade Spray On Truck Bed Liner Coating Kit\n\nThis complete package is everything you need to apply a spray-on liner for your truck. The Herculiner Professional Grade Spray On Truck Bed Liner Coating Kit includes the textured urethane product, hardener, a spray gun to apply it, rollers to apply it that way if you prefer, and even a measuring cup. It\u2019s intended for a single application on an 8-foot box.\n\nRAPTOR Black Truck Bed Coating Kit\n\nOne of the most prolific names in the industry, this RAPTOR Black Truck Bed Coating Kit is perfect for the DIYer to apply on their own. It also contains four bottles of product and hardener, along with a roller handle and four rollers to apply it.\n\nRAPTOR Black Truck Bed Coating Kit\n\nBuy Now \n\nWestin Truck Bed Mat\n\nWhen a less permanent solution is preferable, the Westin Truck Bed Mat has been a go-to for thousands of truck owners for years.

        "title": "How to Hook Up a Trailer",
        "content": "Understanding Trailer Hookup Components\n\nBefore you embark on the journey of trailer hookup, it\u2019s essential to familiarize yourself with the key components involved.\n\nHitch receiver. The hitch receiver is the point where the trailer will attach to your vehicle. There are various types of hitches, including ball hitches, pintle hitches, and fifth-wheel hitches. Make sure your trailer\u2019s hitch matches the type of receiver on your vehicle.\nTrailer coupler. The trailer coupler is the part on the trailer that connects to the hitch ball. It usually features a latch mechanism to secure it in place.\nSafety chains. Safety chains provide an additional layer of security. They should be crossed under the trailer tongue and attached to the hitch receiver to prevent the tongue from dropping to the ground in case of a failure.\nElectrical connector. This connector is essential for your trailer\u2019s lights and signals to function properly. It typically includes connections for brake lights, turn signals, and sometimes electric brakes. Common types of trailer wiring are a four-way flat and a seven-way round connector.\nBreakaway switch. A breakaway switch is crucial for trailers with brakes. It activates the trailer\u2019s brakes in case it becomes detached from the vehicle.\n\nSafety Precautions Before Starting\n\nSafety should always be your top priority when it comes to trailer hookups. Before you begin, ensure you\u2019ve taken these precautions.\n\nRead the Owner\u2019s Manuals\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the owner\u2019s manuals for both your vehicle and trailer. These documents contain essential information about weight limits, towing capacity, and specific hookup instructions.\n\nInspect Your Equipment\n\nCheck your hitch, coupler, safety chains, and electrical connections for any signs of wear or damage. Replace any worn-out components to ensure a secure connection.\n\nKnow Your Trailer\u2019s Weight\n\nDetermine the trailer\u2019s weight and ensure it does not exceed your vehicle\u2019s towing capacity. Overloading can be dangerous and cause accidents.\n\nLevel Ground\n\nPark your vehicle and trailer on level ground to make the hookup process more manageable and secure.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Hooking Up a Trailer\n\nNow that you\u2019ve covered the design and safety aspects, let\u2019s dive into the step-by-step process of connecting a trailer to your vehicle.\n\n1. Position the Vehicle\n\nBack your vehicle up to the trailer so that the hitch receiver aligns with the trailer coupler.\n\n2. Lower the Trailer\n\nUse the trailer jack to lower the trailer coupler onto the hitch ball. Ensure the coupler fully covers the hitch ball.\n\n3. Lock the Coupler\n\nEngage the coupler\u2019s latch mechanism, ensuring it\u2019s securely locked in place. Then, swing the trailer jack up out of the way and secure it.\n\n4. Attach Safety Chains\n\nCross the safety chains under the trailer tongue and attach them to the hitch receiver. Leave enough slack to allow for turns but not so much that they drag on the ground.\n\n5. Connect Electrical Wiring\n\nPlug the electrical connector from the trailer into the matching connector on your vehicle. Test all lights and signals to ensure they\u2019re functioning correctly.\n\nChecking Lights and Signals\n\nProperly functioning lights and signals are crucial for road safety. Before hitting the road, perform the following checks:\n\nBrake lights. Ask someone to help you check the brake lights while you press the brake pedal.\nTurn signals. Ensure both left and right turn signals are working.\nRunning lights. Confirm that the running lights are on when your vehicle\u2019s headlights are turned on.\n\nTips for Ensuring a Secure Connection\n\nTo make sure your trailer connection is rock-solid, consider these tips.\n\nUse a hitch lock. Invest in a hitch lock to prevent theft and ensure your trailer remains securely attached.\n\u00a0Double-check everything. Before you hit the road, double-check all connections, including the hitch, safety chains, and electrical wiring.\nPractice safe driving. When towing a trailer, remember that your vehicle\u2019s handling and braking will certainly be affected. Drive at a safe speed and maintain a larger following distance.\n\nTrailer Weight Distribution and Balance\n\nProper weight distribution and balance are often not considered, and it can be detrimental, uncomfortable in your truck, or even unsafe. Ensure the following:\n\nThe trailer weight is evenly distributed front to back and side to side.\nThe heaviest items are loaded closer to the trailer\u2019s axles.\nUse a trailer tongue weight scale to ensure the right tongue weight if you have access to one.\n\nCommon Mistakes to Avoid\n\nWhen hooking up a trailer, avoid overloading the trailer beyond your vehicle\u2019s capacity. Make sure you secure the coupler latch properly, and double-check it before you drive away or you could be one of the drivers with a serious dent in your bumper or tailgate if the coupler comes off.\nAgain, make sure you check lights and signals before hitting the road. You want other drivers to see where you\u2019re going, and it helps keep courteous interactions on the road.\u00a0\nProperly balancing the trailer\u2019s weight is also something that\u2019s often skipped. Especially with heavy items in the trailer, it can affect how safely you can handle your vehicle during turns, stops, and over bumps.\n\nDisconnecting the Trailer Safely\n\nWhen you\u2019ve reached your destination, follow these steps for a safe disconnection:\n\nPark on level ground.\nEngage the vehicle\u2019s parking brake.\nDisconnect the safety chains and electrical connector.\nLower the trailer jack to raise the coupler off the hitch ball.\nUnlock the coupler and lift it off the hitch ball.\nStore the trailer securely.\n\nMaintenance and Storage Tips for Trailers\n\nTo extend the life of your trailer and ensure its reliability, regularly inspect and maintain all components.

        "title": "Understanding Towing Capacity: A Comprehensive Guide",
        "content": "What is Towing Capacity?\nTo put it simply, towing capacity refers to the maximum weight a vehicle can safely tow. It\u2019s determined by several factors, including the vehicle\u2019s design, engine power, brakes, and transmission. Other factors include the chassis and type of hitch being used.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the towing capacity includes the trailer\u2019s weight and everything inside it, fuel, and any other equipment or supplies. So don\u2019t limit how you calculate the weight of what you\u2019re towing to just the cargo inside the trailer or the item you\u2019re towing.\nWhy is Understanding Towing Capacity Important?\nYou need to understand your vehicle\u2019s towing capacity to avoid putting yourself and others in danger. Exceeding your vehicle\u2019s towing capacity can lead to problems such as reduced vehicle control, increased stopping distances, mechanical failures, or even serious accidents. It can strain your vehicle\u2019s engine and transmission and cause premature brake wear.\nIn many jurisdictions, a legal requirement specifies a towing capacity that you must adhere to.\nHow to Determine a Vehicle\u2019s Towing Capacity\nYou can find the towing capacity for your vehicle within your owner\u2019s manual or the information plate typically found inside the driver\u2019s door. Manufacturers will also provide this type of information online.It\u2019s important to remember that towing capacity can vary significantly between different types of vehicles. Cars, trucks, SUVs, and RVs have their own range and can differ between makes and years.\nTips for Safe Towing\nTo ensure safety while towing, follow these guidelines:\n\nNever exceed your vehicle\u2019s designated towing capacity.\nDistribute weight evenly in the trailer to prevent instability.\nRegularly maintain your vehicle and the towing equipment to ensure optimal conditions.\nConsider additional towing equipment like trailer brakes or weight distribution systems for heavy loads.\n\nUnderstanding your vehicle\u2019s towing capacity is crucial to keep yourself and others safe on the road.

        "title": "Tire Repair Kit Buying Guide 2023",
        "content": "Types of Tire Repair Kits\n\nWhat types of repair products are there for your average automotive tire? Three types of tire repair kits are widely available including:\n\nTire plug kits\nTire patch kits\nCombination plug-patch kits\nAnd sealant kits.\n\nA plug kit typically consists of rubber plugs, an insertion tool, and a reamer. The plugs are inserted into the hole in the tire and then trimmed off flush with the tread. Plugging a tire can help prevent further damage to the tire and they install quickly without dismounting the tire, but there are always limitations. They\u2019re only good on holes about 1/8-inch or less in diameter, and there\u2019s a chance they can get pushed out as you drive.\nA patch kit consists of flat patches that are applied to the inside of the tire on the liner. They include an abrasive tool, adhesive, and rubber patches. They\u2019re usually more durable than plugs alone since they\u2019re applied inside with rubber cement that\u2019s cured, but you need to have the equipment to dismount and remount the tire and reinflate it. It also takes quite a bit longer to do.\nSealant kits are normally a pressurized can of liquid adhesive that\u2019s pushed into the tire through the valve stem. It coats the liner and seals holes from the inside, and they\u2019re fast to use. However, sealant leaves a sticky mess inside the tire that needs to be cleaned up for a permanent repair, and it can destroy valve stems and tire pressure sensors. They\u2019re great for emergencies, though.\nThe only DOT-approved tire repair kit, though, is one that includes a combination plug-patch. It fills the void in the tire tread while permanently patching it from the inside. It takes the longest to complete, naturally, but the tire is considered roadworthy afterward.\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Tire Repair Kit\n\nWhat should you look for in a tire repair kit? These criteria can help you make the best choice.\n\nThe type of puncture. If the hole is small like a staple or a small-gauge screw, a patch or plug can suffice. A cut in the tire may require something like a plug or plug-patch to fill the void.\nEase of use. If you don\u2019t have access to shop equipment to remove, install, and balance a tire, then a plug from the outside or a tire sealant kit might be the right choice.\nDurability. The best, longest-lasting option is a combination plug-patch. Aside from that, the best option is a patch from the inside when it comes to lasting.\nCost. While none of the options are overly expensive, many kits come with enough plugs for multiple repairs if needed. Sealant is costlier since each can is one-time use.\n\nLastly, only use sealant as a last-ditch effort. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll need to replace the tire if you use it, or you may need a new TPMS sensor, valve stem, and an expensive rim cleaning too.\u00a0\n\nRecommended Tire Repair Kit products\n\nSlime Patches with Glue, Scuffer Box Kit 56 Piece\n\nWhen you\u2019re in need of a tire patch, this kit has enough to fix tires many, many times over. The Slime Patches Kit includes 56 patches of various sizes, two tubes of adhesive to ensure it sticks, and the abrasive pad to rough up and clean the surface first. They\u2019re not a DOT-approved solution, and you\u2019ll need to have the tools and patience to pull the tire from the rim to use them.\n\nX-tra Seal Large Plug Patch\n\nWhen you want to fix a fair-sized hole permanently, these X-tra Seal Large Plug Patches are a go-to solution. It comes 15 to a package so you\u2019ll be well-stocked for at least a few years, and they have a spiky sheath to push the plug through the puncture. They can be used anywhere on the flat tread section, but avoid the shoulder and sidewall. Like a basic patch, they need to be installed from the inside.\n\nX-tra Seal Large Plug Patch\n\nBuy Now \n\nX-tra Seal Radial Repair Oval Patch\n\nWhen the leak is from a slice or larger hole, you need a larger patch that\u2019s able to withstand some miles of driving if necessary. These X-tra Seal Radial Repair Oval Patches are 2 7/8\u201d long by 5/8\u201d wide to provide structure and stability for the bigger holes. They\u2019re not intended for a permanent repair, but they can help you get to the shop or to safety.\n\nX-tra Seal Radial Repair Oval Patch\n\nBuy Now \n\nGreat Neck Tire Plug Kit\n\nArguably the fastest way to fix a tire is the tire plug, and the Great Neck Tire Repair Kit gives you 30 plugs plus the reamer, installer, and lubricant to do the job. The 4-inch plugs stay flexible indefinitely to seal the hole, and it can be used while the tire is still mostly inflated \u2013 obviously, without taking it off the rim. A tire plug should always be replaced with a permanent option later on, and too much reaming can hurt the cords, so extreme care should always be exercised with this type of repair.\n\nGreat Neck Tire Plug Kit\n\nBuy Now \n\nFix-a-Flat Tire Inflator\n\nThe original Fix-a-Flat Tire Inflator is still around, and it still seals punctures up to 1/4-inch in diameter. It can seal and inflate a tire in seconds, and then it\u2019s reported to clean out of the tire easily. It won\u2019t fully inflate the tire, but it should give enough inflation to get you somewhere safe to finish it up. Your tire might be out of balance and make the steering shake after, and there\u2019s potential to damage the TPMS sensor, but it can be a fantastic emergency repair option.\n\nFix-a-Flat Tire Inflator\n\nBuy Now \n\nWhen you\u2019re after the best tire repair kit, an AutoZone near you has what you\u2019re looking for.

        "title": "Best Running Boards for Your Truck",
        "content": "Types of Running Boards\n\nThere\u2019s an overarching category of running boards, and a few different styles within each type. They generally break down into:\n\nNerf bars. These are tubular bars that attach to the truck\u2019s frame and provide a stepping surface for getting in and out of the truck.\nSide steps. These are smaller and simpler than nerf bars and are usually attached directly to the cab of the truck.\nRunning boards. These are wide, flat boards that run the length of the cab, providing a larger stepping surface and often with a textured step pad to provide better traction.\n\nRetractable running boards. These are motorized running boards that slide down and out when the door is opened and then retract when the door is closed.\n\nMost trucks will have more than one type available, letting you personalize your vehicle how you like it.\nPros and Cons of Different Types of Running Boards\nNot all running board-type products are created equal, and there are benefits and limitations to each type.\nNerf bars, also called step bars, are relatively common and are made from tubular steel ranging from three to six inches in diameter. They\u2019re good-looking and offer protection for the exterior, plus they\u2019re a good step option.\nHowever, they\u2019re often shorter than the full cab length and don\u2019t offer the most area to place your foot. Plus, installation isn\u2019t the easiest for every kit.\nSide steps are similar, but they\u2019re much shorter \u2013 usually only long enough for access to a single door on each side. That can be a benefit since they intrude less than other styles, but that\u2019s a matter of preference. They\u2019re often simpler to install, but side steps can also be less stable since they\u2019re not as durably mounted.\nRunning boards are wider and fit closer to the truck body. That means your foot gets better purchase on the step, and they most often run the full cab length. They\u2019re arguably the most stylish option too, but they may not be able to withstand the same level of impact as other options, plus they cut into your ground clearance slightly.\nRetractable running boards give you the same benefits as regular running boards, but since they retract up tight against the undercarriage, they don\u2019t reduce ground clearance almost at all. You can maintain your vehicle\u2019s factory look too. They\u2019re more expensive than other types by orders of magnitude, and they can break down or require more maintenance.\n\nBest Running Board by Brand\n\nARIES RidgeStep Running Boards\n\nThey\u2019re what running boards are meant to be. ARIES RidgeStep running boards stand up to the toughest conditions with all-steel construction and are powder coated for corrosion resistance. The VersaTrac installation system makes them secure and quick to install with no need for drilling. Sizes are available for common truck makes and body styles.\n\nDee Zee NXt Running Boards\n\nWhen you need durability and style in one package, DeeZee has excellent options. One popular pick is the NXt series of running boards that are lightweight aluminum and fit close against your truck\u2019s rockers. With a six-inch step area and three lengths to accommodate cab sizes, you\u2019ll be happy with these ones for years.\n\nDee Zee NXt Running Board\n\nBuy Now \n\nLund 5\u201d Oval Bent Nerf Bars\n\nA mid-range product that\u2019s extremely popular is the tubular nerf bar from Lund. Their five-inch oval nerf bars with curved-in ends offer style with either matte black or polished chrome finishes. They\u2019re on the longer end for extended cabs, and they can bear up to 350 pounds per side.\n\nLUND Chrome 5in Oval Bent ABS Nerf Bar\n\nBuy Now \n\nRampage TrailCrawler Steps\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to double down on rocker protection, Rampage TrailCrawler steps might be right for you. They work as rock sliders as well as steps, and they\u2019re made tough as nails. They offer no-drill installation and a three-year warranty, but the only truck they\u2019re available for currently is the Jeep Gladiator.\n\nRampage Running Board\n\nBuy Now \n\nTrailFX Running Boards\n\nAggressive in looks, safe to step on, and powder coated for protection, TrailFX RBT007B series running boards set a pretty high standard. They have a 6.5-inch step surface that\u2019s non-slip and grates that prevent water or snow from collecting on them. They mount to the rocker rather than the frame, so they\u2019re easier to install too.\n\nTrailFX Running Board\n\nBuy Now \n\nWestin Sure-Grip Running Boards\n\nAs the name implies, these Westin running boards are designed with traction in mind, but they don\u2019t skimp on style.

Decide on the design you want, such as the material, color, style, and finish.\nCompatibility. Ensure that the running board that you choose is compatible with your vehicle.\nGround clearance. Consider the amount of ground clearance you want to maintain. If you plan on going off-road, you might prefer a running board that retracts to improve ground clearance.\nInstallation. Consider the level of difficulty involved in installing the running board.\nCost: Determine how much you are willing to spend on a running board.

        "content": "Why Cleaning and Maintaining Your Running Boards is Important\n\nTaking care of your running boards isn\u2019t simply about keeping them in good condition, but about overall vehicle condition and health. If you drive your truck at all where there\u2019s dirt present \u2013 and that means anywhere \u2013 you know that the running boards tend to be the point where mud, grime, gravel, snow, and ice collect. That\u2019s bad for a number of reasons:\u00a0\n\nIt creates a slippery surface to step on. You could fall, wrench your back, or otherwise get injured if you slip off of a slimy or wet running board.\u00a0\nIt accelerates wear on the running board. If there\u2019s gravel, dirt, ice, or anything else that\u2019s remotely abrasive on the step, placing your foot on it will grind at the finish on the running board. Even the best running boards will begin to look worse for wear after a short time.\u00a0\nIt looks bad. Obviously, a clean truck and running boards look much better and you\u2019ll feel more confident behind the wheel.\u00a0\nIt can rust your truck. When dirt collects on the running boards, it tends to be where they join with the truck body. Moisture is held against the surface where any pores, cracks, and scratches are susceptible to corrosion forming prematurely.\u00a0\n\nAs well, there are a handful of fasteners that hold your running boards to your truck body. They can get loose after being trodden on day after day, and smaller parts can actually come off like the end caps or step pads. That\u2019s not safe either, and the running board could break away or you could slip off the step.\u00a0\n\nRecommended Tools to Clean Your Running Boards\n\nIf you already detail your own truck, you don\u2019t need to make a massive investment in new cleaning equipment and supplies for the running boards. A few extra products that will last you for years will come in handy, but it won\u2019t cost a fortune.\u00a0\nTo clean and maintain running boards, you\u2019ll need:\u00a0\n\nSelection of screwdrivers\u00a0\nWrenches or ratchet and socket set\u00a0\nCar wash bucket and wash mitt\u00a0\nWater hose or pressure washer\u00a0\nSoft-bristled brush\u00a0\nCar wash soap\u00a0\nShamois or microfiber cloth\u00a0\nAluminum or stainless steel cleaning spray (if applicable)\u00a0\nCar wax (if applicable)\u00a0\nRoad grime and tar remover\u00a0\n\nWrench Set\n\nBuy Now \n\nSprayer\n\nBuy Now \n\nCar Wash\n\nBuy Now \n\nMicro Fiber Cloth\n\nBuy Now \n\nBug, Tar, Paint, and Cecal Remover\n\nBuy Now \n\nHow to Clean Your Truck\u2019s Running Boards\u00a0\n\nEven the best running boards take a little bit of time to maintain and clean. If you spend a few minutes when you\u2019re detailing your truck, though, it\u2019s going to go quickly. Here are steps to follow.\u00a0\n\n1. Rinse the Loose Dirt Away\n\nUsing a garden hose or a pressure washer, rinse away any dirt and grime that has built up on the running boards and the area around them including the undercarriage and chassis. It\u2019s a good idea to have your truck already washed at this stage.\n\n2. Scrub Stuck-on Dirt Off\n\nUsing warm water in your bucket with mild car wash soap, scrub the complete running board with a car wash mitt. Get any tough spots off with a soft-bristled brush. If there are asphalt spots, oils, or any other hard-to-remove substances, get them off with road grime and tar remover, then do a quick re-wash on that area. Rinse well with clean water afterward.\n\n3. Dry the Running Boards\n\nWipe the running boards dry with a chamois or microfiber cloth. Keep this cloth separate from the rest of your cleaning cloths since you don\u2019t want to rub abrasive materials it could attract onto your paint.\n\n4. Check and Tighten Fasteners\n\nWith the running boards clean, check all of the fasteners holding the running boards in place. There are a few bolts attaching brackets to the frame or undercarriage as well as bolts and screws attaching the brackets to the running boards.\n\n5. Replace Broken Parts\n\n6. Clean and Protect the Finish\n\nPolished aluminum or stainless steel tends to look dull and grimy after a while. Use an appropriate spray for the material your running boards are made of to restore their shine. If your running boards are painted, a coat of car wax can help give their gloss back and protect them until the next time you clean them.\n\nTips for How to Maintain Your Truck\u2019s Running Boards\n\nWhile it\u2019s an uncomplicated procedure to perform, you can make your life even easier \u2013 and safer \u2013 with these tips for maintaining your running boards.\n\nAvoid using detailing sprays to give a high shine on the tread or step. It can make it incredibly slick and unsafe to stand on.\nStay away from harsh chemicals. They can degrade the protective finish or discolor it.\nStay within the load-bearing limits. If more than one person stands on a running board and exceeds its capacity, it could bend or break it.\nConsider replacing older running boards that aren\u2019t in great shape anymore. Rust will reduce its strength.\n\nFor running boards, cleaning or maintenance supplies, or parts to fix your side steps, shop at your local AutoZone.",

        "title": "What Causes Death Wobble?",
        "content": "What Causes a Death Wobble?\n\nDeath wobble is a dangerous, unsettling steering wheel shimmy that feels like you\u2019re about to lose control. Normally, it happens when you\u2019re driving at 40 miles per hour and higher and is initiated by a pothole or bump on the road, although it can also happen seemingly out of the blue. And in some cases, it\u2019s possible to get into an accident because of it, which is why it\u2019s named like it is.\nIt\u2019s sometimes brought on by over-aggressive driving, but that\u2019s seldom the real cause. \u00a0A suspension system that\u2019s been heavily modified without accounting for changes in vehicle geometry is a leading cause, as are suspension components that are in need of replacement. It can be parts like:\n\nLoose ball joints\nWorn tie rod ends\nLoose or damaged track bar\nLoose wheel bearings or hubs\nA steering box with excessive play\nBent shocks\nA leaking or bent steering damper\nWorn control arm bushings\nAny other mounts or bushings that can allow play in the front end\n\nOther causes may be worn tires, over or underinflated tires, an incorrectly adjusted track bar, incorrect alignment angles, or the wrong type of lift kit installed. If you experience death wobble while driving, it is important to check your entire steering and suspension system to determine what is causing the problem and how to fix it.\n\nRecognizing the Symptoms of Death Wobble\n\nAltered trucks and SUVs are most affected by the rapid oscillation felt within the steering system, but it can happen to other vehicles too. Any time an individual feels shaking, oscillation, and vibration coming from the steering wheel for more than two seconds, it is probable that they are experiencing death wobble. Of course, that\u2019s aside from a tire imbalance that\u2019s normally less aggressive and only happens between 50 and 70 miles per hour. Although, it\u2019s good to keep in mind that imbalanced tires can trigger a death wobble when other conditions exist too.\nApart from this sensation, other noticeable symptoms include vibrations and movement through other parts of the vehicle such as the dashboard or seats. When these sensations are apparent during braking or travel over bumps in the road, it\u2019s even more likely that death wobble is present. To ensure safety on the road, it is best to get your vehicle checked as soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms.\n\nHow to Fix Death Wobble\n\nDealing with death wobble can be a difficult and potentially dangerous situation, and there can be many causes. The key to successfully fixing this issue is understanding its origin in your truck or SUV.\nTo get to the heart of this issue, you should start by checking the steering system for tightness and balance, as well as your shocks and springs for wear. Check for leaks or bends in the steering damper, which is where many death wobbles start out. Inspect every ball joint, wheel bearing, bushing, link, and bolt to ensure they\u2019re in good condition. And if anything is out of the ordinary, replace it right away.\nIn addition, it\u2019s important to maintain proper tire inflation and alignment to ensure the tires are wearing evenly. Misaligned wheels can force those front axles into an uneven movement thus causing death wobble.\nIf all else fails, take your vehicle to a pro to diagnose it. Then you can decide whether you\u2019ll fix what they find or have them complete the work.\n\nHow to Prevent Death Wobble\n\nThe key to preventing death wobble is keeping your vehicle\u2019s suspension and steering in good shape all the time. Regular inspections can help you identify if there\u2019s anything loose or worn that needs to be addressed in the near term. Also, tire pressures need to be even and maintained within normal \u2013 consult the label on the driver\u2019s door pillar for the right tire pressure for your vehicle.\nIf you lift your truck or SUV or upgrade the suspension components, get a wheel alignment performed. The alignment angles change when the ride height is modified, and it can contribute to a dangerous death wobble.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

Apply a tree sap remover that\u2019s safe for your material over the affected area and wait for about 15 minutes before scrubbing away any remaining residue with a soft brush or cloth. Finally, use warm soapy water to wash off the cleaner.\n\nWater Stains\n\nTo remove hard water stains or water spots from your tonneau cover, a detailing spray is often all you need. Spray it onto an applicator or cloth, or use detailing wipes.\u00a0\n\nStep-by-Step Cleaning Guide\n\nGeneral care for your tonneau cover is simple and fast, and it can help keep it looking like new and maintain its optimal condition. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to clean your tonneau cover.\n\n1. Clean away loose materials\n\nRemove any debris such as leaves or sticks from the surface of the tonneau using either a vacuum cleaner or soft brush (make sure not to use anything made of steel).\n\n2. Soak and wash\n\nFirst, rinse the cover, laying down clean water that acts as a lubricant. Then, clean off any dirt and grime with a mild car shampoo mixed with warm water and wipe over the tonneau with a sponge or soft cloth.\n\n3. Rinse thoroughly\n\nOnce finished, rinse off the tonneau with clean water using either a garden hose or pressure washer. If using the latter, make sure to adjust the power setting so as not to damage the material of your cover. Use a fan nozzle to avoid blowing away paint or stretching and tearing vinyl.\n\n4. Wipe dry\n\nDry off your tonneau cover thoroughly by wiping it down with either a microfiber towel or compressed air from a safe distance. Air drying will allow for water spots, and it attracts dust.\n\n5. Treat the finish\n\nFinally, apply an appropriate cleaning product specifically designed for automotive surfaces onto the cover and wipe it over with a clean, dry cloth. This will help protect against corrosion and other weather-related damage as well as keep UV rays at bay.\n\nUsing Homemade and Commercial Cleaning Solutions\n\nBug, Tar, Paint, and Decal Remover\n\nWhat\u2019s the best cleaner for tonneau cover stains and regular washes?

        "title": "How to Install a Tonneau Cover",
        "content": "Tools You\u2019ll Need for Installation\n\nOverwhelmingly, tonneau covers are sold and delivered already assembled. All you need to do is put the cover onto your truck bed and secure it in place. That limits the tools you\u2019ll need to do the job. You\u2019ll need common tools and protective gear like:\n\nA utility knife or scissors\nWrenches and/or a ratchet and socket set\nScrewdrivers\nA power drill and drill bits\nMeasuring tape\nGloves\nEye protection\n\nPreparing the Truck Bed\n\nThe truck bed needs some light preparation before installing the tonneau cover. Dust, dirt, and other abrasive or stuck-on materials can cause scratches or prevent the rails from lining up properly. Also, a bed liner, particularly an over-rail or spray-in bed liner, can interfere with the mounting locations for the rails.\nMake sure the bed rails have the clearance they need according to the installation manual for your new tonneau cover, and give your truck a good wash before installing it, particularly focusing on the bed rails.\nIf your kit includes weather seals, they need to be applied before the tonneau cover rails and hardware are set in place.\n\nSteps to Install a Tonneau Cover\n\nThe tonneau cover itself is straightforward to install if you closely follow the instructions. The steps might vary depending on the type you\u2019ve chosen, and we\u2019ll detail a couple of the differences in these steps.\u00a0\n\n1. Lay out the parts\n\nOrganize your parts according to each step of the installation guide. Confirm that all of the required parts are present, undamaged, and correct for your vehicle.\n\n2. Position the rails\n\nThe tonneau cover rests on and attaches to the rails.\n\nFor folding covers and retractable covers, loosely position the side rails on the box rails with the clamps provided.\nFor roll-up tonneau covers, position your rails on the sides AND the tailgate where the Velcro and plastic clips will attach.\n\nDon\u2019t tighten your clamps quite yet.\n\n3. Align and tighten the clamps\n\nAccording to the installation guide, positions your rails accurately, measuring where required. Tighten the clamps to the recommended spec, keeping them aligned. Once they\u2019re tight, inspect to make sure they\u2019re still properly positioned. Rolling covers should install any crossmembers at this stage also.\n\n4. Install the cover on the truck\n\nPlace the cover on your truck at the front, behind the cab. For retractable covers, have a second set of hands help you position the cover, since it\u2019s a bulky, heavy box to install. Attach the cover to your truck bed using the clamps and hardware provided.\nClose the tonneau cover and check alignment\nOnce it\u2019s in place, roll or fold out the tonneau cover from the front until it\u2019s fully extended.\n\nOn retractable covers, ensure it doesn\u2019t bind and it slide smoothly in the tracks.\nFor folding covers, confirm that the latches all engage and the cover sits properly on the bed rails.\nFor roll-up covers, ensure there\u2019s appropriate tension to prevent the top from buffeting in the wind, but not so tight that it could tear.\n\nAdjust the cover if necessary to ensure tight but unrestricted operation.\n\n5. Install drains\n\nFolding and retractable covers typically come with drain tubes to get rid of water that collects in the rails. Install the drain tubes and route them through factory holes in the box. If there aren\u2019t any holes, use your drill to make them where the instructions indicate.\n\nUsing and Securing Your Tonneau Cover\n\nUsing and Securing a Tonneau Cover\nAfter installing a tonneau cover, make sure it works like it should. The three different styles operate uniquely, so get familiar with yours right away.\n\nFor retractable covers, locate the latch. Release it, then slide the cover forward until the rolling section is fully retracted at the front of the truck bed. Pull the strap on the cover toward the tailgate to extend and latch it. Or, if you have a powered retractable cover, simply press the corresponding button on the remote.\nFor folding covers, release the rear-most section and flip it to lay flat on the second section. Repeat the same for the second and third sections as you need, and the fourth if so equipped. With all the sections folded, most covers can be propped open at the front of the bed.\u00a0 Stand it vertically, then locate the prop rods and attach them. To close, release the ball sockets and simply flip the covers closed, pressing down to latch.\nFor soft rolling covers, untie or unclip the cover from the front. Roll the cover out, applying it to the Velcro on either side and the tailgate. Use the hard plastic tabs to secure it by tucking them into the slot on the outer edge.",

        "title": "How to Install a Running Board",
        "content": "Tools You\u2019ll Need\n\nTo install running boards, you\u2019ll need a few common tools from around the garage. They include:\u00a0\n\nWax pencil\nA ratchet and socket set\nAn impact driver\nWrench set\nA drill and bits\nFlat screwdriver or punch\nWheel chocks\nSafety glasses\nFlashlight\nTouchup paint\n\nDepending on the kit you choose, it might use only pre-drilled holes in the frame or you might need to drill new holes for your fasteners. If you need to drill any holes, it\u2019s a good idea to touch up the exposed bare metal with paint to prevent premature corrosion from forming.\n\nSteps on Installing Running Boards\n\nClosely follow the installation guide to ensure you properly fasten your new running boards onto your vehicle. Failing to do so could lead to damage, frustration, poor installation, and they might not bear weight appropriately. However, these steps will provide general guidance on what to expect for installation.\n\n1. Check the Package Contents\n\nBefore installing the running boards, open the package and lay out all of the parts and fasteners. Ensure there are enough for each step required, and familiarize yourself with the steps. It\u2019s a good idea to separate the fasteners according to the installation steps so they\u2019re easily identifiable and accessible.\n\n2. Position and Mark\n\nLay out your brackets for each side of your vehicle. They typically are bent or formed to fit an exact location, so determine which is the front, middle, and rear bracket for both sides. Look under your vehicle and mark the mounting holes for each bracket with a wax pencil along with any holes that need to be drilled.\n\n3. Drill Holes\n\nFollow the adage, \u201cMeasure twice, cut once.\u201d From your mocked-up bracket or the measurements provided for the installation, accurately identify all holes that need to be drilled. Using the drill bit corresponding to your instruction manual, drill all of the necessary holes on one side.\nOnce the holes are drilled, use touch-up paint to coat the exposed metal and let it dry.\n\n4. Secure the Brackets\n\nSome running board kits require fasteners that are snaked into the frame or other hard-to-reach locations. Get these fasteners in place first, then align your brackets and install fasteners finger-tight. Double-check that you\u2019re using the correct fasteners, and always use washers and hardware that the manual says to.\nDon\u2019t tighten them completely at this stage.\n\n5. Fasten the Running Boards\n\nPlace your running boards onto the brackets, aligning the mounting holes on the board with the brackets underneath. Put the fasteners in finger-tight here also. Check clearances to make sure your brackets all line up and the running board is properly positioned.\n\n6. Tighten the Hardware\n\nFinally, tighten all of your fasteners using a ratchet and a wrench. You can also use an impact driver, taking care not to over-tighten fasteners as it can bend or warp parts. As you go, keep an eye on the alignment and make any adjustments to ensure good fitment.\n\n7. Repeat on the Second Side\n\nWith the first side complete, repeat all of the steps on the second side.\n\nRunning Board Suggestions\n\nThere are dozens of running boards that can fit most major makes and models, and it comes down to style, price, and quality to choose one that suits you best. Here are top sellers that you should consider for your truck or SUV.\n\nWestin Running Boards\n\nMade of extruded aluminum and styled with polymer end caps, these Westin running boards have a slip-resistant tread area. They\u2019re vehicle-specific, so they\u2019re designed to bolt up easily to your vehicle with relatively little effort, and they can be fitted with an optional light kit too. What\u2019s great about these boards is that Westin stands behind them with a five-year warranty.\n\nLUND Trail Runner Running Boards\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a custom-fit aluminum running board, LUND is a great option. These Trail Runner running boards come in either a black or bright finish with your choice of diamond-plate or extruded aluminum. Available in four lengths, they install fast with no-drill installation with bracket mounting kits that use factory holes, although the brackets are sold separately.\n\nAries RidgeStep Running Boards\n\nAll-steel construction means these running boards are built to last in the harshest conditions on the toughest jobsites.

        "title": "Running Board vs Nerf Bar: What's the Difference?",
        "content": "What is the difference between a nerf bar and a running board?\n\nBoth nerf bars and running boards are designed to make it easier to enter and exit your vehicle. They also add a bit of extra style to your vehicle as well as offering some protection from road debris. They mount to your frame with brackets under the rocker. Options for both styles include wheel-to-wheel length and cab-length, depending on your preferences. But there are differences between the two.\nThe primary difference between nerf bars and running boards is in their design. Nerf bars are typically made of metal and feature a plastic, rubber, or texturized step section along each side of the vehicle. Commonly, they\u2019re made of tubular steel with 3-inch, 4-inch, and 5-inch diameters. They\u2019re finished in a few different ways: stainless steel, chrome, and corrosion-resistant paint or powder coating.\nRunning boards, meanwhile, may be made of metal, fiberglass, or plastic, featuring a flat panel between four and seven inches wide with a step section integrated into it. They\u2019re often mounted tight against the side of the body rather than having a gap between. Like nerf bars, there are a variety of coatings like chrome, stainless, and black powder coating. Some might even be paintable to match the body color.\n\nBenefits of a running board\n\nOne of the major benefits of running boards vs nerf bars is the size of the tread. In most designs, a running board has a wider, deeper tread section that gives you a more sure-footed grip as you step up or down. Other benefits include:\n\nThey\u2019re more solid. Since they\u2019re mounted closer to your vehicle, they\u2019re often sturdier and can withstand higher weight limits.\n\nThey don\u2019t impede ground clearance. Since they\u2019re tucked closely against the rocker panel, the step doesn\u2019t drop down very far, so it won\u2019t get damaged as easily going over rough terrain or obstacles.\u00a0\nThey tend to be more appealing. Visually, the designs of running boards are geared more aesthetically.\n\nBenefits of a nerf bar\n\nNerf bars are typically more rugged in design, making them appealing for work trucks and offroad-focused looks and use. Also:\n\nThey\u2019re installed lower to the ground. Nerf bars tend to have a vertical drop that makes it easier to get in and out.\n\nThe tread is often replaceable. If the rubber tread breaks or goes missing, it can be replaced instead of needing a whole new set of nerf bars.\nThey let dirt and moisture escape. Since there\u2019s a gap between the step and the vehicle\u2019s body, debris tends to fall through easier rather than getting trapped and forming corrosion.\nThey offer rocker protection. Not only do they help with access, but they can help avoid damage to your truck by guarding the rockers.\n\nWhich style is right for you?\n\nBetween running boards and nerf bars, both offer their own unique sets of benefits. So how do you decide which one is right for you? Here are some tips that can help in making the choice.\n\nConsider practicality\n\nWhen choosing between nerf bars and running boards, consider the practical aspects first. Consider what kind of access you need to get into your vehicle. If you have physical impairments or are vertically challenged, then a lower nerf bar might be a better choice. On the other hand, if ground clearance is an issue then a running board may be more suitable with its lower profile.\n\nThink about looks\n\nRunning boards and nerf bars both come in a range of shapes, sizes, and materials, so it\u2019s important to choose one that complements your vehicle\u2019s look. Consider the finish too \u2013 matte black might look great on an urban SUV, for example, but may not suit an older truck as much.\n\nSafety first\n\nFinally, safety should always be at the forefront of your mind when installing aftermarket accessories on your vehicle. Both running boards and nerf bars offer improved safety due to their solid construction, but always make sure to check that they meet your needs for traction and accessibility, and that their weight capacity is sufficient.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Can You Increase Towing Capacity and Performance?",
        "content": "What Impacts Towing Capacity and Performance\n\nTowing capacity is an important factor to consider when you purchase a vehicle, as it can determine the trailer size and weight you can safely tow. Many vehicles have limited towing capacity due to their design and size, while others may be able to pull greater loads with the right upgrades. Here are some factors that can impact a vehicle\u2019s towing capacity.\n\nVehicle Weight\n\nVehicle weight plays a major role in determining maximum towing capacity as it affects the vehicle\u2019s ability to carry extra weight. The heavier the car, truck, or SUV, the less it will be able to tow. But also, it needs enough weight to handle the trailer\u2019s momentum. it\u2019s important to take into account the difference between the curb weight and the gross combined vehicle weight rating (GCVWR) of any vehicle you\u2019re considering for towing purposes.\n\nFrame and Hitch\n\nThe frame underpins all of the components that affect towing. It needs to be strong enough to bear the weight of the trailer it\u2019s pulling, and the trailer hitch needs to be rated for the trailer\u2019s weight limits. Particularly as it applies to trailer tongue weight and hitch mounting, the frame is one area that can\u2019t be reliably modified and is pivotal in how manufacturers set the max towing limits.\n\nSuspension\n\nThe suspension system is responsible for carrying both its load and any additional load from a trailer. A good suspension system should be able to absorb the additional stress from extra weight without impacting performance or stability, making it an important consideration when selecting a vehicle for towing purposes.\n\nEngine Size and Torque Output\n\nThe engine should also be taken into account when determining its maximum towing capacity, as it affects how much power is needed for pulling a heavy load effectively. In general, larger engines with higher torque outputs mean better overall performance and increased capacity for pulling heavy trailers.\n\nBraking\nOnce you have the trailer in motion, you\u2019ll need to bring it to a stop. Hauling more than your vehicle is rated for can create extreme heat that causes brake fade or warping, plus it can boil the fluid in the brake lines.\n\nModifications and Upgrades for Increasing Towing Capacity and Performance\n\nIf your vehicle doesn\u2019t have enough power to tow a trailer safely or you need to improve its handling with a trailer on the hitch, several modifications or upgrades can be done to increase its towing capacity.\u00a0\n\nUpgrade the Suspension System. Upgrading the suspension system is one of the most effective ways to increase the towing capacity of your vehicle. Installing heavier-duty shocks, struts, and springs will help support additional weight from a trailer while also providing additional stability.\nInstall High-Performance Brakes. Improvements to the brake system can help reduce stopping distances when hauling heavy trailers. This should include larger calipers, stainless steel lines and performance pads as they will provide more efficient braking when loaded up.\n\nModify the Powertrain. If you want increased power for pulling heavier loads, you might need power add-ons or performance upgrades. This could include installing a programmer or tuner, as well as upgrading the exhaust system for improved airflow. Doing so will result in improved performance and greater tow capacity for heavier loads.\nAdd a Transmission Cooler. The transmission fluid gets hot under heavy loads, and a manufacturer\u2019s \u201cmax towing capacity\u201d might require adding a transmission cooler to achieve it.\nInstall a Higher Capacity Hitch. If your hitch is a Class 1 or 2 with a limit of 3,500 pounds and your truck is capable of pulling up to 10,000 pounds, switching the hitch to a Class 3 hitch can instantly get you more capacity. A weight-distributing hitch also tends to increase your limit.\nInstall an Electric Trailer Brake Controller. This accessory lets you apply the electric brakes on heavier trailers (if they\u2019re equipped) so your truck\u2019s brakes aren\u2019t responsible for all the stopping power.\n\nOther modifications are possible to add more towing capacity and performance such as installing a turbo or supercharger, changing differential gear ratios, installing a larger radiator, or increasing your fuel injector size. However, these modifications will likely impact your vehicle\u2019s warranty, and they\u2019re complex mods to make.\n\nChoosing the Right Modifications for Your Vehicle\n\nIf you\u2019re choosing the right mods to make to increase towing capacity on your vehicle, here are some suggestions:\n\nChoose plug-and-play options. Any modifications you can do that don\u2019t need extensive installation such as a power programmer and trailer brake controller are an excellent choice.\nStick with direct replacement parts. If you\u2019re changing suspension or brake components, for example, pick parts that are designed for your vehicle but are intended to improve performance.\nInstall the highest capacity hitch, receiver, and ball. Having access to the highest trailer towing capacity requires that all of your hitch components are rated for at least the maximum trailering weight rating for your vehicle.\n\nRemember, a well-maintained vehicle is key to unlocking the best towing potential too, so make sure the air filter, fuel filter, spark plugs, and other tune-up components are in good shape.",

To measure the length of your truck bed, measure from the inside of the bed at the front of the truck to the inside of the bed at the back of the truck. To measure the width of your truck bed, measure the inside of the bed from one side to the other.\u00a0\nOnce you have these measurements, you can use them to find a tonneau cover that is the right size for your truck. Many tonneau cover manufacturers will have a size chart available on their website or in their product descriptions to help you find the right size cover for your truck.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to get a tonneau cover that fits your truck properly, as a cover that is too small may not fully protect your truck bed and cargo, while a cover that is too large may not fit correctly and may be difficult to use.\u00a0\n\nChoose a Tonneau Cover by Model\n\nThere may be variations between the box lengths and widths even within one model, so always use the measurements you\u2019ve taken to compare with the options you\u2019re considering.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTruck Bed Tonneau Cover Size Chart\n\nIf you\u2019re driving a recent model year truck, the following tonneau cover size chart can help you confirm your measurements to ensure the right fitment.\u00a0\u00a0\nModel/Advertised length\u00a0Actual bed length\u00a0Ford F150\u202f(2021)\u00a05.5 ft\u00a06.5 ft\u00a08 ft\u00a0\u00a067.1 in (5 ft 7.1 in)\u00a078.9 in (6 ft 7.9 in)\u00a097.6 in (8 ft1.6 in)\u00a0Dodge Ram\u202f(2022)\u00a05 ft 7 in\u00a06 ft 4 in\u00a0\u00a067.4 in (5 ft 7.4 in)\u00a076.3 in (6 ft 4.3 in)\u00a0GMC Sierra\u202f(2022)\u00a0Short\u00a0Standard\u00a0Long\u00a0\u00a069.92 in (5 ft 9.92 in)\u00a079.44 in (6 ft 7.44 in)\u00a098.2 in (8 ft 2.2 in)\u00a0Chevy Silverado 1500\u202f(2022)\u00a0Short\u00a0Standard\u00a0Long\u00a0\u00a069.92 in (5 ft 9.92 in)\u00a079.44 in (6 ft 7.44 in)\u00a098.18 in (8 ft 2.18 in)\u00a0Toyota Tundra\u202f(2022)\u00a05.5 ft\u00a06.5 ft\u00a08.1 ft\u00a0\u00a065.6 in (5 ft 5.6 in)\u00a077.6 in ( 6 ft 5.6 in)\u00a096.5 in (8 ft 0.5 in)\u00a0Chevy Colorado\u202f(2022)\u00a0Short\u00a0Long\u00a0\u00a061.7 in (5 ft 1.7 in)\u00a074 in ( 6 ft 2 in)\u00a0Ford Ranger\u202f(2021)\u00a05 ft\u00a06 ft\u00a0\u00a061.7 in (5 ft 1.7 in)\u00a072.8 in (6 ft 0.8 in)\u00a0Jeep Gladiator\u202f(2021)\u00a060.3 in ( 5 ft 0.3 in)\u00a0Toyota Tacoma\u202f(2022)\u00a05 ft\u00a06 ft\u00a0\u00a060.5 in (5 ft 0.5 in)\u00a073.7 in (6 ft 1.7 in)\u00a0Nissan Frontier\u202f(2022)\u00a073.3 in (6ft 1.3 in)\u00a0\n(sourced from https://tailoredtrucks.com/blog/size-of-a-pickup-truck-bed/)\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re searching for a tonneau cover, AutoZone has the selection to find the right fit and style for your needs.

        "title": "Trailer Hitch Buying Guide: Choosing the Right Hitch for Your Needs\u00a0",
        "content": "Can you put a trailer hitch on your vehicle?\u00a0\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s possible to install a trailer hitch on most vehicles. There are many different types of trailer hitches available, and the specific hitch that is suitable for your vehicle will depend on the make and model of the vehicle, as well as the weight and size of the largest trailer you\u2019ll want to tow.\u00a0\nTo install a trailer hitch, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and use the proper tools and equipment. Depending on the type of hitch you are installing, you may need to drill holes, cut through the bumper, snake bolts into blind holes in the frame, or make other modifications to the vehicle\u2019s chassis. If you aren\u2019t comfortable modifying your vehicle, it\u2019s recommended to have a professional install your trailer hitch, as improper installation can compromise the safety of the hitch and the vehicle.\u00a0\nBefore installing a trailer hitch, it\u2019s important to make sure that your vehicle is capable of safely towing the weight of the trailer or device you plan to use. You should also make sure that you have the proper towing equipment, such as a hitch ball, wiring harness, and brakes if required, and that you are familiar with the proper towing techniques and safety precautions.\u00a0\n\nThe three types of trailer hitches\u00a0\n\nFor non-commercial vehicles including pickup trucks and SUVs, there are three broad trailer hitch categories.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nReceiver hitches\u00a0\nFifth-wheel hitches\u00a0\nGooseneck hitches\u00a0\n\nOf these three types, only trucks that need to haul flatdeck trailers, livestock trailers, and large campers will use gooseneck and fifth-wheel hitches. They mount in the truck bed and have a coupler or hitch ball to connect to the trailer.\u00a0\nFor all the others, you\u2019ll need a receiver hitch. These mount under the rear bumper to the frame, and there are five classes to choose from.\u00a0\n\nClass 1 hitches\u00a0\n\nThe lightest duty trailer hitch is a Class 1, and it\u2019s typically reserved for compact cars and crossovers. The receiver is a 1 1/4-inch square tube that connects with a pin and clip. The maximum tongue weight is up to 200 pounds, and the limit for the trailer\u2019s weight with contents is up to 2,000 pounds. It\u2019s the type you\u2019d use to connect a bike carrier or pull a utility trailer with a garden tractor, for example.\u00a0\u00a0\nOur pick for a class 1 trailer hitch is from one of the best-known brands in the industry, Curt. The Curt Class 1 trailer hitch features a tubular drawbar and durable black paint with a square 1 1/4-inch receiver. They\u2019re manufactured for a direct fit according to model, and they seldom require vehicle modifications.\u00a0\n\nClass 2 hitches\u00a0\n\nLike their smaller sibling, class 2 hitches have a 1 1/4-inch receiver, but they\u2019re more capable. Generally, a class II hitch will be rated at up to 3,500 pounds of total trailer weight and 350 pounds of tongue weight. You might find yourself pulling a trailer with a cubic yard of aggregate or soil, or a small boat or pop-up travel trailer.\u00a0\nOur pick for class II is the Draw-Tite trailer hitch. Long-lasting black powder coat protects the all-welded steel construction. They\u2019re model-specific with bolt-on installation that typically takes no modification.\u00a0\n\nClass 3 hitches\u00a0\n\nClass 3 hitches cover a broad swath of the market. They\u2019re used on many SUVs, minivans, crossovers, and pickup trucks and have a 2-inch receiver. They\u2019re made even more durable and have a maximum tongue weight of 800 pounds, which is a significant bump. As well, the gross trailer weight tops out at 8,000 pounds, covering towables like travel trailers, most boats, and sometimes even car haulers.\u00a0\nOur choice for the class III segment is a Reese Towpower Class III hitch. Where most options are model-specific, this option fits a range of models, years, and across a handful of makes too. The sliding frame adjusts to your vehicle, requires no special tools, and carries a 3-year warranty.\u00a0\n\nClass 4 hitches\u00a0\n\nGenerally, the largest, sturdiest hitch you\u2019ll want for a passenger-carrying vehicle is a Class 4 hitch. They\u2019re meant for full-framed trucks and SUVs and can pull up to 10,000 pounds with a maximum tongue weight of 1,000 pounds. You\u2019ll want to pair this hitch with an electric trailer brake controller if your vehicle doesn\u2019t already have one.\u00a0\nCurt Class IV hitch options are our pick in this category. They have a dual finishing coat to keep them in good shape and are made to bolt straight onto your application. With a limited lifetime, warranty, they\u2019re a solid choice.\u00a0\n\nClass 5 hitches\u00a0\n\nStretching the limits of what vehicles will feasibly tow, class 5 hitches have tongue weights of up to 2,550 pounds and can pull a max gross trailer weight of 17,000 pounds. Only a few models on the market, namely 3/4-ton and 1-ton trucks, will employ these big guns, and for massive trailers just below commercial size.\u00a0\nThe Draw-Tite Class V Box Universal Trailer Hitch gets you these limits. The boxed draw bar offers incredible strength and it\u2019s fully powder coated for longevity.",

        "title": "How Much Does It Cost to Install Trailer Hitches?\u00a0",
        "content": "Installation cost for different types of trailer hitches\u00a0\n\nWhat type of trailer hitch do you require? That\u2019s one of the primary factors for determining how much you\u2019ll pay for the parts and installation. They split into three broad categories: receiver hitches, gooseneck hitches, and fifth-wheel hitches.\u00a0\n\nReceiver hitches\u00a0\n\nBy and large, receiver hitches are the type you\u2019ll find on almost all vehicles towing a trailer for non-commercial purposes. These hitches install underneath the rear bumper and bolt to the chassis or frame. Receiver hitches are manufactured from high-grade carbon steel in most cases, and they\u2019re painted or powder coated black to protect them from the harsh environment they\u2019re exposed to.\u00a0\u00a0\nA receiver hitch is available in five grades for non-commercial use:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nClass 1 hitches are for compact cars and sedans for up to 2,000 pounds of gross trailer weight.\u00a0\nClass 2 hitches are for passenger vehicles like crossovers and have a GTW of up to 3,500 pounds.\u00a0\nClass 3 trailer hitches are intended for mid-size and full-size SUVs and trucks with a GTW of up to 8,000 pounds.\u00a0\nClass 4 hitches are for full-size vehicles and are rated to haul a gross trailer weight up to 10,000 pounds.\u00a0\nClass 5 hitches are for 3/4 ton and 1-ton trucks with GTW of up to 17,000 pounds.\u00a0\n\nParts cost\u00a0\n\nGenerally, receiver-style hitches increase in price as the class gets higher, but minimally considering the capacity differences. Depending on the model you drive and the class you need, you can expect to pay between $150 and $400 for most receiver hitches.\u00a0\n\nService cost\u00a0\n\nInstalling a receiver hitch is usually a straightforward job. They\u2019re almost always fitted and pre-drilled for fasteners that use existing bolt holes in the frame, and they\u2019re commonly vehicle-specific. Some models might need a section of the rear bumper trimmed for the receiver to extend out of, but there aren\u2019t many models that require intensive modifications. Installation tends to be between $75 and $150, although some shops may charge less or significantly more.\u00a0\n\n5th-Wheel hitches\u00a0\n\n5th Wheel Hitches\n\nBuy Now \n\nSome trailers have a coupler that drops down from an elevated segment, and one type is a 5th-wheel coupler. These are for heavier-duty trucks, mostly 1-ton models and up, and the trailer coupler slides and locks into a yoke head with a U-shaped wear plate mounted in the truck box.\u00a0\u00a0\n5th-wheel hitches range up to about 30,000 pounds capacity, so they naturally need to be secured extremely well. The hitch is usually bolted through the truck bed to the chassis over the rear axle, which requires drilling and/or cutting.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nParts cost\u00a0\n\nThe parts for a fifth-wheel hitch are the biggest part of the job. Expect to pay between $700 and $1,500 for a standard 5th-wheel trailer hitch kit that includes the hardware and mounting rails, although there are some models that are quite a lot more.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nService cost\u00a0\n\nInstalling a 5th-wheel hitch can be a relatively fast job that can cost as little as $75 or it could be hours of work including cutting. If it\u2019s a complex installation, it could be a few hundred dollars to get it fitted, adding up to $400 or more.\u00a0\n\nGooseneck trailer\u00a0\n\nGooseneck Trailer\n\nBuy Now \n\nA gooseneck trailer hitch is used for very similar functions and trailers as a 5th-wheel, but the major difference is that the ball mount is in the truck bed and the coupler is on the trailer. The hitch is fastened to the truck chassis through the bed, and a ball extends upward for the trailer to connect to. Gooseneck hitches tend to be more for commercial or agriculture usage, and the parts and installation ranges from about $700 to $1,000 or so.\u00a0\n\nParts cost\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDepending on the kit you choose, the parts for a gooseneck trailer hitch range from around $300 to $800 or so.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nService cost\u00a0\n\nFor most types of gooseneck hitches, you\u2019ll need to cut and/or drill through the bed to fasten the hitch to the frame. Similar to the 5th-wheel installation, you can expect it to cost a few hundred dollars to fit this type of hitch.\u00a0\n\nCan I install my own trailer hitch?\u00a0\n\nFor a DIYer, the job of installing a trailer hitch is certainly possible at home. You\u2019ll need space to work under your vehicle\u2019s back end as well as tools that can securely torque the bolts in the frame. But since safe towing requires that the trailer hitch is installed properly, you shouldn\u2019t do it yourself if you have any doubts about your capabilities.",

        "title": "What Is a Tonneau Cover?",
        "content": "What Are Tonneau Covers?\n\nFolding tonneau Cover\nWhat is a bed cover anyway? A bed cover, popularly known as a tonneau cover, is a cover that fits over the bed of a pickup truck. It is designed to protect the contents of the bed from the elements and to improve the truck\u2019s aerodynamics, which can improve fuel efficiency. It also encloses the truck bed so passersby can\u2019t see what you\u2019re carrying, and hopefully, they\u2019re less tempted to pilfer your belongings.\nSome tonneau covers install over the edge of the bed rail, offering the full truck bed height for carrying your cargo. They\u2019re a little more protection against water intrusion in most cases, but they can be broken into with relative ease. Tonneau covers that mount flush with the bed rail offer more security especially with a locking tailgate as you can\u2019t get into it without first dropping the tailgate. But they typically aren\u2019t as adept at channeling water away from your gear inside, although some have drains built into the rails.\n\nTypes of Tonneau Covers\n\nThere are several different types of tonneau covers available, including hard covers, soft covers, and roll-up covers. Hard tonneau covers are made of rigid materials such as fiberglass or aluminum. Some are hinged at the front of the bed, as you\u2019ll find with most one-piece fiberglass covers, and others are made of three or four aluminum panels that fold together and secure behind the back window when they\u2019re not in use.\nSoft covers are made of flexible materials such as canvas or vinyl and are typically rolled or folded up when not in use. They\u2019re usually secured with either Velcro or a rigid plastic lip on the edge to keep it in place. Roll-up covers are made of a series of interconnected panels that roll up and down to cover the bed, and they can sometimes have a motorized rolling system.\n\nWhat Are Tonneau Covers Used For?\n\nThere are several main purposes for tonneau covers:\n\nProtection. Tonneau covers can protect the contents of the bed from rain, snow, and other elements. This is especially useful if you need to transport sensitive or valuable items.\nSecurity. A tonneau cover can also help to keep the contents of the bed secure by making it harder for people to access the bed without your permission.\nFuel efficiency. A tonneau cover can improve the aerodynamics of the truck, which can help to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. The difference is minimal, though, so it\u2019s not a primary motivator for most buyers.\nAppearance. Tonneau covers can also improve the appearance of the truck by giving it a more streamlined and polished look. Some tonneau covers can be painted to match your truck\u2019s body too.\nIncreased storage. Some tonneau covers can be folded or rolled up when not in use, which can increase the amount of usable storage space in the bed.\n\nWhat is the best tonneau cover? It\u2019s a matter of preference. Soft covers are usually less expensive while doing a decent job of protecting your stuff. Hard tonneau covers are more secure but they come with additional cost. And if price is no object, a roll-top cover is the most convenient option.\n\nDo I Need a Tonneau Cover For My Truck?\n\nA tonneau cover can be a useful accessory for a truck, as it can protect the bed of your truck and its contents from the elements and potential theft. However, whether or not you need a tonneau cover for your truck will depend on your specific needs and preferences. Here are a few factors to consider when deciding whether to get a tonneau cover:\n\nHow often do you use the bed of your truck? If you frequently use the bed of your truck to haul large items or tools, a tonneau cover can help protect them from the weather and keep them secure.\n\nHow much storage space do you need? A tonneau cover can reduce the amount of available storage space in the bed of your truck, as it covers part of the bed. If you need a lot of space for larger items, a tonneau cover may not be the best choice.\n\nWhat is the climate like where you live? If you live in an area with frequent rain or other inclement weather, a tonneau cover can help protect your cargo from getting wet.\n\nUltimately, the decision to get a tonneau cover for your truck will depend on your specific needs and preferences. And be sure to measure your truck box length and width to get the right fitment.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What are the Different Trailer Hitch Types and Classes?\u00a0",
        "content": "Types of trailer hitches\u00a0\n\nThere are five types of trailer hitches to consider, and each has its purpose. You might notice some features cross over between types, but they\u2019re still unique.\u00a0\n\nReceiver Hitch\u00a0\n\nA receiver hitch is a device that is mounted to the frame of a vehicle and provides a tow point for attaching a trailer or other towable object. It\u2019s by far the most common type of trailer hitch for passenger and commercial vehicles. A removable hitch ball adapter slides into the receiver and is fastened by a pin. Then, the trailer\u2019s tongue coupler locks over top of the ball.\u00a0\u00a0\nReceiver hitches are classified according to their weight-carrying capacity, with Class 1 being the lowest and Class 5 being the highest:\u00a0\n\nClass 1 hitches are designed for light-duty towing, with a weight-carrying capacity of up to 2,000 pounds. They are typically used for small trailers, such as utility trailers or small boat trailers.\u00a0\nClass 2 hitches are designed for medium-duty towing, with a weight-carrying capacity of up to 3,500 pounds. They are typically used for medium-sized trailers, such as small camper trailers or travel trailers.\u00a0\nClass 3 hitches are designed for heavy-duty towing, with a weight-carrying capacity of up to 8,000 pounds. They are typically used for large trailers, such as fifth-wheel trailers or horse trailers.\u00a0\nClass 4 hitches are designed for very heavy-duty towing, with a weight-carrying capacity of up to 10,000 pounds. They are typically used for the heaviest trailers, such as large recreational vehicles or commercial trailers.\u00a0\nClass 5 hitches are the most heavy-duty of all, with a weight-carrying capacity of up to 20,000 pounds. They are typically used for the heaviest trailers, such as large commercial trailers or military vehicles.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s important to choose the right receiver hitch class for your towing needs, as using a hitch that is not rated for the weight of your trailer can be dangerous and potentially cause damage to your vehicle.\u00a0\n\n5th Wheel Hitch\u00a0\n\nA fifth-wheel hitch is a specialized towing device that is designed for use with large trailers, such as recreational vehicles (RVs) or commercial trailers. It consists of a large, U-shaped frame that mounts to the bed of a pickup truck or other tow vehicle, and a kingpin that fits into the frame and provides the connection point for the trailer.\u00a0\nSome 5th-wheel hitches are permanently mounted in the truck bed while others are on rails and can be removed when they\u2019re not in use. Typically, there are weight ratings that range from 16,000 pounds up to 30,000 pounds.\u00a0\n\nGooseneck Hitch\u00a0\n\nGooseneck hitches have a lot in common with 5th-wheel hitches since they mount in the truck bed too. However, they use a hitch ball rather than a kingpin to connect the trailer to the truck. Gooseneck hitches are geared more toward agriculture and commercial applications like livestock and flatbed trailers. They\u2019re usually rated to pull trailers of up to 30,000 pounds, and sometimes even more.\u00a0\n\nWeight Distribution Hitch\u00a0\n\nA weight distribution hitch, also known as a load-leveling hitch or equalizing hitch, is a towing accessory that helps distribute the weight of a trailer more evenly across the tow vehicle and trailer axles. It consists of a hitch head that mounts to the frame of the tow vehicle, and a set of spring bars that are connected to the hitch head and the trailer frame.\u00a0\nWeight distribution hitches are typically used with trailers that are heavily loaded or have a high tongue weight, which is the weight that is applied to the hitch on the tow vehicle. When the trailer tongue weight is too high, it can cause the tow vehicle to become unstable and difficult to control, especially when driving on uneven roads or making sharp turns.\u00a0\nTo use a weight distribution hitch, the trailer is first loaded and the tongue weight is measured. The spring bars are then adjusted so that they apply a downward force on the trailer frame, helping to transfer some of the weight from the hitch to the trailer axles. This helps to distribute the weight more evenly, improving the stability and handling of the tow vehicle and trailer.\u00a0\n\nPintle Hitch\u00a0\n\nA pintle hitch is a towing device that consists of a hitch ball mounted on the tow vehicle and a pintle hook that fits over the ball and provides the connection point for the trailer. Pintle hitches are typically used for heavy-duty towing, and are often found on military vehicles, construction equipment, and other industrial vehicles.\u00a0\nPintle hitches are known for their strength and durability, as the ball and pintle hook are designed to handle high loads and withstand rough terrain. They are also simple to use, as the pintle hook can be easily attached and detached from the hitch ball by hand.\u00a0\nPintle hitches are typically used with trailers that have a lunette eye, which is a loop-shaped attachment point that fits over the pintle hook.\u00a0\n\nWhich Trailer Hitch Is Best?\u00a0\n\nUnless you drive a heavy-duty pickup truck larger than a half-ton, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to be best served with a receiver hitch. Most drivers of passenger vehicles seldom need more than a Class 2 hitch, but pickup trucks may need a Class 3 or Class 4 hitch to ensure they\u2019re best equipped to pull trailers to their vehicle\u2019s full capacity.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s most important in selecting the right trailer hitch is matching your trailer to the vehicle safely without exceeding your vehicle\u2019s GVWR.",

        "title": "How to Wire Your Trailer",
        "content": "What Connectors Are There and What Are Trailer Wiring Codes\n\nThe format shown to the left is the standard wiring format found on most vehicles and trailer wiring kits. If your trailer needs wiring, your best solution is to purchase a light kit that includes wires.\nHow to\u00a0Wire Your Towing Vehicle\n\nIf your vehicle came from the factory with a towing or camping package, you may already have a vehicle side 4-way flat or 7-way RV blade connector already installed. The 7-way connectors are always in the vicinity of the center of your rear bumper, mounted on a tab or mounted into the bumper itself. Sometimes, 4-way flat connectors are tucked up under the rear of the vehicle. Your vehicle owner\u2019s manual should tell you how to determine if a connector is already installed.\nIf your vehicle did not come with a factory installed wiring harness, your vehicle may have wiring plugs in place to help you install trailer wiring. Consult the diagram below to see common locations for wiring plugs.\nRead your owner\u2019s manual and check your vehicle thoroughly before cutting or tapping into any wires on your vehicle.\n\nHow to\u00a0Connect the Wiring Harness\n\nA wiring harness exists for most vehicles. They range from a T-connector harness (pictured left) that plugs into a factory connection, to a universal harness that must be spliced into the factory wiring.\nMany newer vehicles have a connection at the rear of the vehicle. The installation is as easy as unplugging the connection and inserting the T-connector in between the two plugs.\nAn older vehicle\u2019s existing wiring harness may need to be spliced to install a towing connector. Luckily, most of the wiring you need connects to your vehicle\u2019s tail lights. The exception is the wiring for a brake controller.\nIf you want 5, 6 or 7-way functions then you need to cut and splice into the wiring. For trailer brake operation please see the electric brakes.\nSome vehicles may also require a taillight converter. This converter adapts separate turn and stop lights to standard trailer taillight wiring on import and domestic vehicles.\n\n1. 4-WAY FLAT\n\nMost lighting kits use the common 4-way flat connector with three male ends and one female end. The connector is designed so that you cannot connect the plug backwards. This connector is mirrored on the vehicle side.\n\nTurn Signals \nBrake Lights \nTail Lights \nGround \n\n2. 5-WAY FLAT\n\nIf your trailer includes backup lights, you can still use a standard wiring kit, but most vehicles that are wired for towing do not include a 5-way flat connection. You may need an adapter or to install extra wiring in your vehicle to support the extra light.\n\nTurn Signals \nBrakes Lights \nTail Lights \nBackup Lights \nGround \n\n3. 6-WAY POLE\n\nIf your trailer includes back up lights and electric brakes, but is not wired for auxiliary power, then a 6-connect can be used.\n\nTurn Signals \nBrake Lights \nTail Lights \nBackup Light \nElectric Brakes \nGround \n\n4. 7-BLADE RV\n\nIf your trailer includes back up lights, electric brakes and auxiliary power, then a 7-way connection is needed. The most common style today is the 7-Blade RV style which uses flat \u201cblade\u201d style pins instead of the traditional round connectors.\n\nTurn Signals \nBrake Lights \nTail Lights \nBackup Light \nElectric Brakes \nAuxiliary Power \nGround \n\nWhat to Do\u00a0If Electrical Wires Don\u2019t Match\n\nIn some cases your tow vehicle\u2019s electrical connector may not match the trailer wiring connector. In that case you need an adapter. However, you can only adapt down (i.e. 7-Blade on the vehicle to 4-Flat on the trailer, but not 4-Flat on the vehicle to a 7-Blade on the trailer).\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "content": "Trailer Hitch Accessories You Need for Your Truck\u00a0\n\nEvery accessory you buy for your truck\u2019s trailer hitch is an addition to your vehicle, and that makes it either more cool, more fun, or more practical. Or sometimes all three! There are a lot of different directions you can go in with trailer hitch parts and accessories, but here are a few ones that we think you might need.\u00a0\n\nBall Hitch\u00a0\n\nBall hitches are very practical accessories for your truck. Simply put, ball hitches are what allow you to use a lot of other accessories, or tow a lot of items. Many things that you need to tow attach directly to a ball hitch, so having one increases the capability of your truck. They\u2019re an absolutely essential trailer towing accessory. If you have a truck, you need a ball hitch. Case closed.\u00a0\n\nHitch Covers\u00a0\n\nHitch covers are a super fun way to add a little bit of decoration and personal flair to your vehicle. Bumper stickers? Those are so 1995. With a hitch cover, you can personalize your truck a little bit more. Some people like to put their vehicle\u2019s brand logo on the hitch cover, to show off some pride in their truck. Other people like to adorn their hitch with the logo of their favorite sports team or college, to display their rooting interests. Whatever you opt for, hitch covers are a subtle but strong way to make your truck yours.\u00a0\nBut they\u2019re more than just for aesthetics. Hitch covers also keep debris from getting in your hitch, and help the hitch stay clean. They\u2019re practical and good looking, which is what everyone wants for their truck.\u00a0\n\nREESE Towpower 2in Hitch Box Cover\n\nBall Mount\u00a0\n\nHitch ball mounts are must-have towing accessories for anyone who decides to put a ball hitch on their truck. Ball mounts are very simple. They protrude from the truck hitch, and then you place the ball hitch on the end. In other words, they\u2019re essentially a ball hitch extender, which allows the ball hitch to be a few inches separated from the rear fender of your truck.\u00a0\u00a0\nBy extending the ball hitch, the ball mount makes the truck ball hitch more accessible, and easier to attach to. It also helps prevent damage to the ball hitch.\u00a0\n\nREESE Towpower 5 3/4in Drop Interlock Ball Mount\n\nCoupler Lock\u00a0\n\nCoupler locks are necessary hitch towing accessories for anyone who leaves the item that they\u2019re towing unattended. It\u2019s pretty easy to steal an unlocked item in tow. If you\u2019re towing something small, someone can detach it from your hitch, throw it in their car, and run off in a matter of minutes, if not seconds. Even if you\u2019re towing something large, someone else with a truck can detach the item from your tow hitch, attach it to their own, and drive away. And then the next time you head out to your truck, you\u2019ll be met with heartbreak.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s where coupler locks come in. Coupler locks are simple, and protect the items you\u2019re towing. When the coupler is locked, you won\u2019t be able to detach the item that\u2019s hooked to the hitch. Simple, but a necessary safety and security measure.\u00a0\n\nREESE Towpower Heavy Duty Trailer Coupler Lock\n\nHitch Step\u00a0\n\nHitch steps are a very practical addition to a truck. They simply attach to the hitch, and create a stepstool-like step. With a hitch step, it\u2019s a lot easier to access the items that are in your truck bed. They\u2019re a borderline necessity if you have a truck rack and need to access it.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt\u2019s easy to install and remove a hitch step, so you can quickly take one off if you need to tow something, and then put it back on. It might not seem like you need a step there \u2013 after all, you have a fender to step on \u2013 but you\u2019ll be amazed at how much more practical your truck feels when you have an additional step in the back. Plus, they look pretty cool.\n\nBully Black Bull Series LED Hitch Step\n\nOverland Hitch Accessories\u00a0\n\nThe world of trailer hitch accessories gets even wilder if you include overland builds. The accessories for overland vehicles feature pretty much everything you could ask for. Many enthusiasts have entire grill stations that attach to the hitch, making it easy to cook amazing meals wherever they are. There are also a lot of table hitch accessories, so you can turn your hitch into an on-the-go dining table. TV stands are popular hitch accessories for overland enthusiasts, with some people even going so far as to mount projectors on their truck hitches.\u00a0\u00a0\nNot all overland hitch accessories are about fun and games though. It\u2019s also common to use hitch-attached cargo racks to carry extra luggage and gear.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Best Trailer Hitches for Your Vehicle\u00a0",
        "content": "Finding the right trailer hitch for your vehicle\u00a0\n\nWhen buying a trailer hitch, it\u2019s important to find one that matches your specific needs and requirements but is also compatible with your vehicle make and model. Hitches are divided into five different classes.\u00a0\nClass 1 hitches can tow up to 2,000 pounds and are designed for small compact cars, full-size sedans, as well as small to medium-sized crossovers. They use a 1.25-inch receiver and can attach to the bumper or the frame itself.\u00a0Class 2 hitches are engineered to fit sedans, crossovers, minivans, and smaller SUVs. They can generally tow up to 3,500 pounds and require a 1.25-inch receiver. These hitches can also attach either to the bumper or to the frame.\u00a0Class 3 hitches are most common since they use a 2-inch receiver and fit most modern crossovers, minivans, SUVs, trucks, and even flatbeds. A Class 3 trailer hitch has a towing capacity between 3,500 to 12,000 pounds. They can only attach to the vehicle frame.\u00a0Class 4 and Class 5 trailer hitches are designed for larger SUVs, 1/2-ton to 1-ton trucks, and flatbeds.\u202fThe main difference is that Class 4 trailer hitches offer an 8,000 to 14,000 pounds towing capacity,\u202fwhile Class 5 trailer hitches can tow anywhere between 16,000 to 20,000 pounds. Class 4 hitches use a 2-inch receiver opening while Class 5 hitches have a 2.5-inch receiver.\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe trailer hitch consists of several different parts:\u00a0\n\nThe hitch itself which attaches to the frame or the bumper\u00a0The receiver tube that connects to the hitch\u00a0The ball mount which is sometimes replaced by a towing hook\u00a0The trailer hitch ball that the trailer coupler rests on\u00a0Safety chains that ensure the trailer doesn\u2019t detach from the vehicle in case of mechanical failure\u00a0The electrical connector, usually a trailer wiring harness that supplies power to the trailer\u2019s taillights\u00a0\nEven though there are a dozen tow hitch manufacturers on the market, only a handful stand out both in terms of quality and price.\u00a0\nEvery hitch should be able to adjust to the position of the trailer relative to the vehicle and allow free articulation. It should also be strong enough to cope with the trailer\u2019s weight placed on the hitch itself to prevent mechanical failure. Last but not least, the hitch needs to be rigid enough to deal with speed variations and prevent a possible trailer-to-car collision.\u00a0\n\nCURT trailer hitches\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes to trailer hitches, CURT is definitely the most popular choice among all classes of hitches. Regardless of your vehicle make and model, the chances that CURT manufacturers a trailer hitch for your vehicle are extremely high if not guaranteed.\u00a0\nDesigned and made in the USA, CURT offers extremely high quality trailer hitches for basically every vehicle on the road today.

        "title": "4-Wheel Drive (4WD): What You Need to Know",
        "content": "What is 4-Wheel Drive?\u00a0\n\n4-wheel drive (4WD) refers to a drivetrain that sends power to all four wheels. 4WD drivetrains are either part-time or full-time, which means that power doesn\u2019t always have to go to all four wheels. For example, many SUVs with 4WD drivetrains use 2WD for everyday driving but have an option to switch to 4WD for hazardous conditions or off-roading.\n4WD is almost exclusively found in two-axle vehicles and a transfer case is needed to distribute the torque to each axle. It\u2019s also important to note that some 4WD vehicles are classified as all-wheel drive (AWD) but this is less common. AWD vehicles always have power going to four wheels but the amount of torque reaching each wheel is regulated by the vehicle\u2019s computer.\u00a0\n\nWhat are the Advantages of 4WD?\u00a0\n\n4WD vehicles have several advantages. Many of the advantages are based on hazardous road conditions and off-roading. Whether or not you need a drivetrain that sends power to all four wheels depends on how often you maximize its advantages.\u00a0\nYou\u2019ll appreciate things like:\u00a0\n\nEasier to gain traction in snowy conditions and on icy roads\u00a0\nGreat for off-roading\u00a0\nSome 4WD vehicles will climb over large boulders with the right suspension\u00a0\u00a0\nIn full-time 4WD vehicles, it can be turned off or on to preserve the drivetrain\u00a0\n\nThe advantages of this drivetrain make it the perfect system for off-roading and wintery weather.\u00a0\n\nWhat are the Disadvantages of 4WD?\u00a0\n\nWhile 4WD has several advantages, it\u2019s not perfect. Some disadvantages are more serious than others, so it\u2019s important to weigh your options.\u00a0\nYou might not be too fond of things like:\u00a0\n\nHeavier than 2WD and AWD vehicles\u00a0\nLess fuel efficient than 2WD vehicles\u00a0\nThe drivetrain sustains damage when using 4WD incorrectly\u00a0\n\nAlways make sure you avoid switching to 4WD when you\u2019re driving in regular conditions to avoid premature wear.\u00a0\n\nHow 4WD Works\n\nWhen 4WD is engaged, power is sent to all four wheels of a vehicle. Torque is sent to the wheels, which forces them to rotate. Power is first sent to the vehicle\u2019s transmission and transfer case, which splits the torque between the front and rear axles.\u00a0\n\nWhat is Part-Time 4WD?\u00a0\n\nPart-time 4WD is when a transfer case can switch from just rear wheel drive to 4WD and back with either a lever in the cab or the press of a button. Once a vehicle is switched into 4WD, power goes to all four wheels to maximize traction. Instead of power going to only the rear wheels, the transfer case rotates gears connected to the front axle. Once the gears match the speed of the rear wheels, the system is fully engaged.\u00a0\n\nWhat is All-Wheel Drive?\u00a0\n\nVehicles that have primarily FWD systems and engage the rear wheels to assist when traction is lost have all-wheel drive, or AWD. Most automatically engage when the car\u2019s computer detects wheel slippage, although some have selectors to disable AWD or to choose the torque distribution for weather.\u00a0\n\nAlternatives to 4-Wheel Drive\u00a0\u00a0\n\n4x4s are popular drivetrains but there are many effective alternatives. Typically, the alternatives to 4WD are front-wheel drive (FWD) and rear-wheel drive (RWD). Both of these drivetrains are also known as 2WD systems.\u00a0\n\nFront-Wheel Drive (FWD)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFWD systems send power to the front two wheels of a vehicle. These vehicles have less weight than 4WD vehicles because there\u2019s fewer moving parts since power only needs to travel a few feet to reach the wheels, instead of traveling to the rear of the vehicle.\u00a0\nFWD vehicles are great for driving in almost any conditions, especially when it\u2019s dry, and they\u2019re more affordable than 4WD vehicles. Also, these vehicles are more fuel efficient because of the reduced weight and less friction from moving parts. The downside to these drivetrains is that they don\u2019t handle as well around sharp turns.\u00a0\n\nRear Wheel Drive (RWD)\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRWD vehicles have drivetrains that send power to the rear wheels. In these drivetrains, power from the engine travels to the rear wheels and turns them to propel the vehicle forwards. 4WD drivetrains are RWD drivetrains when 4WD isn\u2019t engaged.\u00a0\nThere are a few benefits to RWD. Handling around turns is improved because weight is distributed more evenly between the front and the back of the vehicle. These drivetrains are also more cost-effective to repair because fewer parts are crammed into a small space.\u00a0\nThe drawback to RWD is reduced traction in bad weather.\u00a0\n\n4 Wheel Drive FAQ",

        "title": "Guide To The Best Truck Bed Tents\u00a0",
        "content": "What Is A Truck Bed Tent?\u00a0\nA truck bed tent is a tent that can be pitched in the back of a pickup truck, as opposed to being pitched on the ground. A camping tent for truck can be an extremely comfortable and convenient way to spend a night on the trails in the great outdoors. Truck bed tents aren\u2019t the only mobile solutions, there are also rooftop truck tents. But here, let\u2019s look at some of the pros and cons of truck tents that can be pitched in the back, or bed.\u00a0\n\nPros:\u00a0\n\nSupremely convenient and quick, as they do not require finding a suitable site, erecting tent poles, pitching tent ropes and ensuring that the ground is stable.\u00a0\nBeing off the ground offers a greater benefit in terms of safety against all kinds of ground-borne insects, snakes, and even larger predators.\u00a0\nCan be semi-permanently set up in the back of your truck, and contain all necessary camping gear within which is great if you regularly go on multi-day off-road forays.\u00a0\nA pop-up truck tent can be folded down when travelling to improve visibility and gas mileage, and popped-up when parked at your campsite to offer greater space.\u00a0\n\nCons:\u00a0\n\nTruck bed tents are more expensive than regular tents.\u00a0\nThey take up all the space in your truck bed and you will need to store your cargo within the tent.\u00a0\nSome truck bed tents will fully or partially obscure rear vision via the rearview mirror.\u00a0\n\nAre Truck Bed Tents Comfortable?\u00a0\n\nComfort is a very subjective term, as its very definition will vary from person to person. Truck bed tents are known to be very comfortable, and there are models that offer sewn-in padded floors which offer the best comfort. Even if your chosen truck bed tent has a basic floor, or uses your truck bed as the floor, you can enhance comfort through the use of rubber mats, upon which soft furnishings and bedding materials can be placed. Truck bed tents are typically weatherproof, so as long as installed properly, there is little danger of water entering a properly closed tent. One avenue adopted by truck bed tent users is to place an air mattress on the floor, further enhancing comfort, and many manufacturers of tents for the back of trucks produce correctly-sized air mattresses as well.\u00a0\n\nTruck bed tent\n\nWhat To Consider with a Truck Bed Tent\u00a0\n\nOne final consideration that is a top tip from us at AutoZone is to remove your truck bed tent and store it in your closed garage or shed when not in use. Driving around with it installed on your truck bed exposes it to sun, UV rays, rain, grime, dirt, dust, and other detritus that can have a detrimental effect on it over time.\u00a0\n\nAre Truck Bed Tents Worth It?\u00a0\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind spending $190, which is the cost of the least expensive truck tent at AutoZone, truck bed tents are fully worth every dollar. Consider the fact that your sub-$200 investment nets you a supremely capable and convenient way to pitch a tent without needing to actually pitch it. Add an air mattress that starts at under $100, and you\u2019ve got a comprehensive and comfortable accommodation option for under $300 that fits right in the bed of your truck. Even if your frequency of off-roading and camping is a mere twice or thrice a year, it\u2019s a worthwhile investment.\u00a0\n\nBest Truck Bed Tents For Camping\u00a0\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled a small list of three of the best tents for truck beds. While this list is by no means exhaustive, it\u2019s a great place to start, and many of these manufacturers are known for decent truck tents, so you\u2019re bound to find something else from them if none of these three are the right fit for you.\u00a0\n\nRightline Gear Truck Tents\u00a0\n\nRightline produces a range of truck tents for short (5\u2019), full-size (6.5\u2019) and long (8\u2019) truck beds, and their floorless design means that installation and removal is easier. Your gear can remain on the bed without needing to be unloaded and reloaded. These tents offer storage pockets, a lantern hook, skylights to gaze at the stars, and glow-in-the-dark zipper pulls which some reviews have mentioned could be a bit sturdier. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a great way to dip your toe into truck bed tents.",

        "title": "How to Install a Trailer Hitch",
        "content": "What Type of Trailer Hitch Should You Get?\n\nEvery aftermarket tow hitch is rated for a certain towing capacity, and that rating must match the capacity of your vehicle. Your first step in researching your new hitch installation is to check your vehicle owner\u2019s manual for the towing capacity of your vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\nSome small cars and crossovers are not rated for any towing but can still be fitted with a low-capacity tow hitch that will accept bike racks or other active-living accessories.\u00a0\u00a0\nMany mid-sized minivans, crossovers, SUVs, and small trucks have tow ratings between 2000lb and 3500lb, and you\u2019ll find towing capacities of 5000lb and up on the largest SUVs and many full-size pickup trucks.\u00a0\n\nThere are Five Classes of Trailer Hitches:\n\nClass 1 Trailer Hitches\nClass 1 \u2013 Uses a receiver size of 1-1/4-inch, can tow up to 2,000lbs and has a maximum tongue weight of 200lbs. The tongue weight is the weight that rests on the hitch, as opposed to the total weight of the item you are towing.\u00a0\n\nClass 2 Trailer Hitches\nClass 2 \u2013 Uses a 1-1/4-inch receiver, can tow up to 3,500lbs, with a maximum tongue weight of 350lbs.\n\nClass 3 Trailer Hitches\nClass 3 \u2013 Uses a 2-inch receiver, with a towing capacity of up to 10,000lbs and a maximum tongue weight of 1,000lbs.\n\nClass 4 Trailer Hitches\nClass 4 \u2013 Uses a 2-inch receiver, can tow up to 15,000lbs, with a max tongue weight of 1,500lbs.\n\nClass 5 Trailer Hitches\nClass 5 \u2013 Uses a 2-inch receiver, with a towing capacity of up to 17,000lbs and a maximum tongue weight of 1,700lbs.\n\nWhen choosing a hitch for your vehicle, you may want to select a class that exceeds the maximum towing capacity of your vehicle, so that you don\u2019t accidentally tow something that is too heavy for your hitch.\nFor instance, many minivan owners will opt for a class 3 hitch with an 8,000lb capacity, even though their vehicle has a towing capacity of only 3,500lbs.\n\nHow to Install a Trailer Hitch\n\nChock your front wheels and jack up the rear of the vehicle so that you have access to the undercarriage. Be sure to use jack stands to support the weight of the vehicle.\nRefer to the installation instructions from the hitch manufacturer to find the area you\u2019ll be working on. You may need to remove a spare tire, heat shield, or even lower your muffler to gain access to the mounting points.\nClean the area around the mounting points with a wire brush to remove any rust or debris. If there are pre-threaded holes in the frame you can clean them with lubricant and a tap. You may need to drill holes to mount the hitch, or fish in the bolts through the frame.\nPosition the hitch under the vehicle and prop it up so that you can work on the bolts with two hands. Either enlist the help of a friend or use blocks.\nFasten all the bolts and nuts and torque them to the manufacturers specifications using a torque wrench.\n\nDepending on your make and model of vehicle, you may need to install a wiring harness to the hitch for towing a trailer. Be sure to wrap all the wires in protective tape or flexible tubing, to avoid premature wear on the wiring harness, and then zip tie the whole thing up in areas that are protected from road debris. This will save you headaches down the road!\nYou can expect the whole process to take between two hours and most of a day, depending on your specific vehicle and your level of mechanical expertise.\nOnce you have completed the trailer hitch installation, determine the size of hitch ball you will need as well as the appropriate ball mount for your vehicle height.\n\nThe Tools You Will Need\n\nA trailer hitch installation is a medium to expert-difficulty task, depending on the vehicle. There will be certain tools that are a must-have, and others that may be required for more difficult installations. Let\u2019s start with the must-haves:\n\nA set of wheel chocks, and either ramps or a jack and jack stands, to elevate the vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\nSafety glasses. You\u2019ll working upside down under the vehicle and all kinds of stuff will fall in your eyes.\nGood lighting.\nA screwdriver set, including flat-head and Phillips heads at the very least.\nA 1/2-inch socket and ratchet set. You can probably make do with a 3/8-inch set, if that\u2019s what you have.\nA set of combination wrenches, in case you need to turn bolts in harder to reach places.\u00a0\nTorque wrench, for final torque on the bolts.\nA pry bar, in case things need a little encouragement to fit properly.\nWire brush, to clean all the mating surfaces before installation.\n\nSome items will be needed if the installation is more challenging:\n\nA tape measure and marking pen, to mark drilling positions.\nA high-speed drill with appropriate drill bits, for drilling holes in your car frame.\nLubricants for cutting or releasing seized parts.\nSpecialty tools like Torx bits, if your car requires them.\n\nItems that are optional:\n\nNitrile gloves or mechanics gloves are great for reducing the amount of dirt and grease that become embedded in your hands when working on vehicles. They can also reduce injuries and fatigue.\nA creeper can reduce fatigue by allowing you to move easily under the vehicle.\n\nShould you get a professional installation?\n\nDepending on your level of mechanical experience and your vehicle type, you\u2019ll need to set aside between two and eight hours to complete this job. Start by doing some research on your vehicle to see how difficult it is.\nIf you decide that it\u2019s too big a job to tackle on your own, let AutoZone help you find qualified professional mechanics through our Shop Referral Program.",

        "title": "Choosing the right tow strap for your vehicle",
        "content": "What are tow straps?\n\nTow straps are typically composed of polyester or polypropylene and are used to tow a freely-moving car behind another vehicle. Tow straps have loops, and hooks are installed at the end of those loops to pull vehicles. It\u2019s important to note that because of the material they are made from, tow some straps do not stretch. Because there isn\u2019t any give on these straps, a vehicle that may need to be moved from an area with challenging conditions may instead require recovery straps.\n\nHow to use a tow strap\n\nAttaching a tow strap\n\nTow straps can be an effective tool for towing your car \u2014 if you have access to a heavy-duty truck \u2014 or helping out a friend or family member. However, it\u2019s important to be careful when using them, as incorrectly using a tow strap can damage your car. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to follow the steps carefully:\n\nAttach the tow strap to your vehicle\u2019s hitch \u2013 If you have a heavy-duty vehicle, you likely have a trailer hitch or possibly a hitch ball. Locate the hole in the hitch or hook below the ball that is specifically designed for towing and attach the tow strap\u2019s hook there.\u00a0\nLink the other end of the strap to the vehicle \u2013 For this one, it helps to have the towed vehicle\u2019s owner manual accessible. That can help you find the car\u2019s mounting hook, where you\u2019ll place the tow strap\u2019s hook. Most cars have one, and it should be located toward the front of the vehicle.\u00a0\n\nEnsure the strap is securely installed \u2013 Before you begin to tow the car, you want to ensure the tow strap has been correctly installed. Check your hitch and the underside of the towed vehicle. You may also want to lightly tug the strap to confirm that it\u2019s connected.\u00a0\nDrive slowly \u2013 Once you are sure the tow strap is installed correctly, get in your vehicle, slightly accelerate, and then drive slowly. You want to avoid any sudden accelerations and braking.\n\nAgain, the goal here is to securely fasten the strap hooks to each vehicle and that the strap is the right length to pull the car safely.\n\nChoosing the Right Tow Strap for Your Vehicle\n\nAll tow straps aren\u2019t equal. So, you need to select the best one for your potential towing needs. Here are some attributes you should consider as you choose a tow strap product:\u00a0The state of the vehicle that needs to be towed \u2013 Tow straps don\u2019t typically have elasticity. This could be a problem if you\u2019re towing an immobilized vehicle or a car stuck in a ditch or mud. If you encounter something like this, it\u2019s best to have a recovery strap made of nylon since it has more give.\u00a0The vehicle\u2019s weight \u2013 How much your car weighs will determine the length of tow strap you\u2019ll need. You need to ensure that you purchase a strap that is rated at three times your vehicle\u2019s weight. For example, the typical weight of a Toyota Camry ranges between 3,310 and 3,595 pounds. That would mean that you\u2019ll need a tow strap with a rating of no less than 9,930 pounds. You also want to ensure you don\u2019t get a strap that\u2019s too large, which can impact its towing ability.\n\nA List of the Recommended Tow Straps\n\nAgain, finding the right tow strap is essential to ensuring the safety of your vehicle if you need to tow it. We\u2019ve included a few recommendations to help you find the correct tow strap for your car.\n\nSmartStraps 30ft 22,500lb Recovery Strap\n\nIf you prefer to avoid tow chains, then this SmartStraps recovery strap is a great option.

        "title": "What Are the Different Types of Tonneau Covers?",
        "content": "Over-rail or Flush Mount: Which Tonneau Cover is Better?\n\nAmong all the different types of tonneau covers, there are two broad categories they\u2019ll fall under: over-rail or flush mount. Over-rail tonneau covers fasten on top of the bed rail while flush mount covers fit between the bed rails. Naturally, that means flush mount tonneau covers are narrower than over-rail covers, but there are a few benefits to each type to consider.\n\nOver-rail tonneau covers tend to:\n\nGive a little more cargo room in the truck bed, simply due to a few inches more height underneath.\u00a0\nSeal out moisture better since it wraps over the edge of the bed.\nInstall a little easier.\nCome off more easily if you need to remove it.\n\nFlush mount tonneau covers:\n\nAre more streamlined and appear less bulky.\nTend to be more secure since they can\u2019t be opened without dropping the tailgate.\nCan often open fully for bed access without completely removing the cover.\n\nIn the end, there are great options in both styles, so you\u2019ll need to make that decision based on your needs.\n\nWhich tonneau cover style offers better security?\nBlack Tonneau Cover \nWhether you\u2019re a contractor, camper, or someone just transporting valuable items from time to time, getting your gear ripped off is hugely inconvenient. Tonneau covers inherently help to avoid theft by helping eliminate the temptation for a five-finger discount. No cover is 100% perfect at stopping a thief, but certain styles are better than others.\nHard covers are obviously better than soft covers since they\u2019re not so easily slashed or broken to get access into the box. Over-rail tonneau covers can be pried away from the bed rail if someone were so inclined, although a keyed lock at the tailgate helps to deter thieves. Hard-cover flush mount or roll-top tonneau covers are a great solution for security since they combine latches, locks, and solid panels to protect your stuff. Again, it\u2019s a choice you\u2019ll have to make.\n\nTypes of Tonneau Covers\n\nLet\u2019s review the types of tonneau covers and the benefits they provide. From there, you can make an informed decision on which is best for you.\n\nSoft Roll-Up Tonneau Cover\nUsually, the least expensive option to keep your tools or what-have-you out of the elements is a soft roll-up tonneau cover. Rails are mounted on top of the bed rails to secure a fabric panel, whether it\u2019s vinyl or canvas-like material. When they\u2019re rolled, straps behind the cab hold it in place. Some options like Leer Soft Roll-Up Tonneau Cover simply use tension to keep them taut, held in place by premium hook-and-loop closures. Others have crossbars to prevent something like a snow load from making it collapse.\n\nLEER Soft Roll-Up Tonneau Cover\n\nRetractable Roll-Up Tonneau Cover\nOne of the more expensive options is a retractable roll-up cover. This is a flush mount-style tonneau cover that usually incorporates a lock at the tailgate. When it\u2019s released, tension springs pull it to the front of the box into a box where it\u2019s coiled. The panel is quite solid when in use, formed by metal slats across the bed. One of the most popular options is a LEER Roll-Up Retractable Tonneau Cover with sizes to fit most makes and models.\n\nLEER Roll-Up Retractable Tonneau Cover\n\nHard Folding Tonneau Covers\nArguably the most popular tonneau covers on the market today are hard folding covers. Some styles are over-rail but most are flush-mounted. Depending on the manufacturer, they could be foam-core aluminum panels or hard plastic. Since they\u2019re mounted flush, they tend to be more secure if your tailgate locks. If it doesn\u2019t lock, side locks on the cover can help prevent unwanted opening. When you need access to the box, the panels flip and fold forward. Some even flip up and secure at the back of the cab, giving unintended back window protection. You\u2019ll find tri-fold and quad-fold styles from a variety of manufacturers like the extremely popular BAKFlip MX4 Hard Tri-Fold Tonneau Cover.\n\nBAK BAKFlip MX4 Hard Tri-Fold Tonneau Cover\n\nSoft Folding Covers\nWant a folding cover without the high cost? The style is also available with soft panels. It\u2019s essentially a hybrid of the soft roll-up cover and a hard folding cover. It\u2019s typically an over-rail design and vinyl or canvas material, but it can be opened more easily by folding it like the hard cover style. A tri-fold option like the Extang Trifecta 2.0 Soft Tri-Fold Tonneau Cover comes highly rated, and quad-fold options are available too.\n\nExtang Trifecta 2.0 Soft Tri-Fold Tonneau Cover\n\nSolid Fiberglass Tonneau Cover\nWhen style trumps function, a solid fiberglass cover could be right for you. These covers are over-rail designs but are more dust-resistant and watertight than others since they can be sealed with weatherstripping. They\u2019re a solid panel that hinges up from behind the back window and they\u2019re quite cumbersome to remove. Where they\u2019re an attractive option is when a color-matched cover is your desire since they are painted to match. Expect a solid folding fiberglass cover to cost three to four times as much since it\u2019s a one-piece molded part and requires paint, plus likely you\u2019ll want professional installation.",

        "title": "Cool Truck Accessories and Mods",
        "content": "Customize Almost Anything\n\nWith aftermarket truck mods, you can make significant changes that improve performance, handling, comfort, and more. Some of the most popular aftermarket accessories that you can use to modify your truck include:\n\nInterior accessories\nExterior mods\nMotor accessories\nExhaust parts\nDrivetrain and suspension mods\n\nWhether you drive a pickup truck or SUV, a wide range of bolt-on custom parts and cool truck accessories can transform your vehicle into whatever you want it to become. Common interior modifications include aftermarket seats, upgraded entertainment systems, and mirrors. As for exterior modifications, there are wheel flares, side steps and rocker guards, truck grill guards, bed covers and inserts, and front and rear bumper replacements. Updated parts for motors, suspensions, drive axles, wheels, and brakes can greatly improve your truck too.\n\nSimple Performance Mods\n\nFor relatively little money, you can make great improvements to your truck\u2019s throttle response and power by installing a high-flow air filter. Many of the best aftermarket brands, like K&N, Fram, and others, provide high-flow air filters that increase the amount of clean air and oxygen that gets to the combustion chamber. These cool truck accessories boost the potential power produced and might even give you better gas mileage. \nYou also can replace the stock air filter housing with an aftermarket upgrade. These affordable products place a high-flow air filter in the ideal location to draw in more air and produce more power. \nThe high-flow filters are easy to clean and maintain to ensure the best airflow and filtration. Many will last a lifetime, which can save you money over replacing the more restrictive stock air filters once a year. \nOther commonly used performance mods that you can bolt onto your truck include new spark plugs, wires, a distributor, and an ignition. If you want to add more pickup, you can mount new throttle bodies and reprogram the ECM to retune the engine and deliver even better horsepower and torque to your drive wheels.\n\nTruck Mufflers and Exhaust Mods\n\nAftermarket exhaust and truck mufflers give your truck the best bolt-on power modifications. You can buy an entire performance exhaust system that does a better job of expelling exhaust gases while enabling greater airflow towards the engine. The faster the combustion chamber expels exhaust and spent gases, the faster a high-flow air filter can deliver more clean air. That adds up to a cleaner-burning engine and more horsepower and torque produced by the motor while using essentially the same amount of gas that a stock system would use.\n\nExhaust Options Abound\n\nOne of the most popular modifications is to swap out a restrictive stock muffler and exhaust. It\u2019s easy to get aftermarket truck mufflers and an exhaust that enhances airflow as well as the sound coming from the exhaust tips. Your truck can make more power with the addition of a high-flow exhaust and muffler. \nOnce you mount an aftermarket dual exhaust, you\u2019ll really hear your motor rev and run while on the streets or at your favorite off-roading location. You can do a simple muffler replacement or modify the entire exhaust for ideal results.\n\nImprove Stopping Power\n\nAfter completing a few performance truck mods, your brakes might need some help slowing things down. A wide range of aftermarket brake pads, calipers, rotors, and master cylinder improvements can greatly improve your truck\u2019s braking performance. Just switching from stock brake pads to performance brake pads with aftermarket rotors that channel away heat to fight warpage can give you a lot more stopping power. This is also true for aftermarket calipers that have more brake pistons to distribute stopping power to the pads and rotors more efficiently.\n\nLifting and Lowering Kits\n\nIf you want to do a lot of off-roading, you\u2019ll likely find a suspension lift kit to be highly beneficial. You can raise the truck by a couple of inches or more with a simple installation of a lift kit. These truck mods will give you more ground clearance to get over rocks and out of ruts. A taller truck will likely benefit from additional grab rails and steps to improve access. \nAlternatively, if you intend to mostly drive on the street and never see dirt, then a lowering kit might be in order. You can lower your truck\u2019s street profile while enabling easier access to the cabin. This can be helpful when you\u2019re loading large items in the bed. The suspension will still support the stock truckload and towing capacity, but you\u2019ll enjoy better access and a different general profile.",

        "title": "What Size Hitch Ball Do I Need?",
        "content": "What is a\u00a0Ball Mount?\n\nA Ball Mount is a removable hitch ball platform that slides into the receiver of a hitch and fastens with a pin and clip. Different ball mounts can be used to raise or lower the height of the ball to allow for level trailer towing.\nDifferent classes of ball mounts fit different receiver tubes:\n\nClass I & II:\u00a01-1/4\u2033 receiver tube\nClass III & IV:\u00a02\u2033 receiver tube\nClass V:\u00a02\u2033 or 2-1/2\u2033 receiver tube\n\nIt is important to identify mounting location, hitch ball, shank diameter, and thickness if you are not purchasing a combo. Then you can measure the diameter of the hole and thickness of the mounting location to choose a matching ball mount.\n\nWhat is a\u00a0Hitch Ball?\n\nA hitch ball (or trailer ball or just ball) is the ball-shaped attachment that connects the trailer to a hitch. While the diameter of the hitch ball is fairly standard, shank diameters, and hitch ball weight ratings may differ. The rating of the hitch ball is just as important as the receiver hitch ratings.\n\nBall Diameter (A):\u00a0Check the top of the trailer coupler for the size of the ball diameter required. The size is usually stamped there. Recreational and light commercial hitch balls come in a variety of sizes including 1-7/8\u2033, 2\u2033, 2-5/16\u2033 and occasionaly 3\u2033. In general lighter trailers use smaller hitch balls. It is VERY important to match the trailer to the correct hitch ball.\nShank Diameter (B):\u00a0This is the diameter of the threaded shaft that is inserted through the ball mount. Shanks come in a variety of sizes (5/8\u2033, 3/4\u2033, 1\u2033, and 1-1/4\u2033) and capacities. (7,000lbs-17,000lbs)\nShank Length (C):\u00a0This is length of shaft that extends beyond the mounting base of the hitch ball. It is important to use a shank that is long enough to extend beyond the thickness of the draw bar mounting tab to ensure that enough threads are available to securely fasten the ball to the mount.\nShank Rise (D):\u00a0The height of the shank can be used to raise a trailer back to level in the event the \u201crise\u201d or \u201cdrop\u201d of a ball mount is inadequate.\n\nHow to Level Your Trailer\n\n1. Arrange Your Vehicle and Trailer\n\nPark your vehicle and trailer on level ground.\n\n2. Level Out the Trailer Tongue\n\nPlace a level on top of the trailer tongue, and adjust the trailer up or down until the bubble inside the level shows that the trailer tongue is level with the ground below.\n\n3. Measure the Draw Bar Shank\u2019s Height\n\nUsing a tape measure or something similar, measure from the top of the part of the draw bar that connects with the receiver tube to the ground. Record this measurement and label it A.\n\n4. Measure the Trailer Tongue\u2019s Height\n\nGet your tape measure again and measure from the bottom of the trailer tongue to the ground. Record this measurement and label it B.\n\n5. Subtract for Drop\n\nSubtract B from A for the amount of \u201cdrop\u201d you will need to keep your trailer level (A \u2013 B = \u201cdrop\u201d).\nIf the \u201cdrop\u201d value is negative, it is referred to as \u201crise.\u201d",

        "title": "Everything You Should Know About Light Bars",
        "content": "What is a Light Bar\n\nEssentially, a light bar mounts onto the roof (sometimes elsewhere, but normally the roof) of a truck or SUV in order to help provide additional lighting. Given that many people who own modified trucks like to go off-roading or otherwise drive in dark, unlit spaces, having a light bar can make these endeavors much more fun and far less dangerous.\nWay back in the day, people who wanted to drive their trucks in unlit spaces would just stack headlights on top of headlights until they got the output they wanted, but then the aftermarket caught up to desire and started offering other options.\nThe original solution was KC HiLites, which you may recognize from the famous vehicle in Back to the Future. However, while these were cool looking and definitely provided a lot of light output, they required replacing bulbs far too often and the amount of power they needed to operate could result in a difficult installation.\nThus, attention turned to LED light bars. LED light bars can provide an outstanding amount of light with a comparatively small amount of required power. They also operate at far lower temperatures than halogen and are extremely reliable. The issue originally with LED was the expense, but this has definitely dropped in recent years. If you don\u2019t believe us, go ahead and check out the lightbulb selection at your local big-box store. You\u2019ll definitely see a lot of affordable options.\nEssentially, light bars have solved one of the major problems facing off-road enthusiasts for years: how to get a lot of light for a little money, little hassle, little power, and not needing to install a heavy-duty headache rack in order to attach halogen lights. This is why you see light bars basically anywhere you go. They are practical, affordable, and make off-roading fun.\n\nWhat to Consider When Buying a Light Bar\n\nNow that we have convinced you that light bars are the best thing since sliced bread, you\u2019re probably tempted to go out and purchase one right away. However, it\u2019s important to keep some things in mind to ensure that you end up with the right light bar for you.\nIf you are looking to outfit a vehicle for recreational activities like camping, off-roading, hunting, or anything like that, you want to turn an eye to the amount of lumens that different light bars produce. The more lumens that are available, the more light that a light bar produces. Therefore, you should focus on getting the light bar with the highest lumen output that you can afford.\nIf you are the sort who needs a light bar on a work vehicle, your concerns are slightly different. You definitely want to make sure that you have a waterproof housing on your light bar for when you have to work in inclement weather.\nFor those of you (we know who you are) who simply just want to trick out your truck and make it look great, your main concern is likely style. Take a look at the different finishes available in the market and see what your preferred aesthetic is. You also want to consider where you want to mount the light bar. You could choose a mount on the top of the cab, the front bumper, the grill, or the brush guard. You also want to check out how exactly the light bar mounts, so that you have the best chance of hiding the wiring.\nTo these ends, there are many different options in the light bar market. Pay attention to the size of the light bar. Those that are around four feet long can generally be mounted in a variety of different positions, but if it\u2019s five foot and up you\u2019re usually stuck just putting it on top of the cab. Make sure that you get a bar that fits your truck well.\nPay attention to what the light bar comes with, as well. Some of them are entire install kits, and some of them are simply the light bar itself. If you want to install a lone light bar, you need to invest in mounting brackets, relay, switch, wiring, and nuts.\nLight bars can also come in a smorgasbord of colors. The color output can certainly be used to up the cool factor if you are building a show truck, but they can also be used in work applications as well. For instance, different colors can indicate whether a truck is empty or full.\nTechnology is also something to turn an eye toward. Most light bars operate with a manual switch, but some of them also offer Bluetooth technology as well. This allows you to turn the light bar on and off when you are outside of your vehicle by means of an app.\nThe good news is that installing a light bar is not very difficult at all (this is part of the reason they are so popular). You only require basic tools, such as an allen wrench set, a socket and ratchet set, and an extension.\nThen, simply follow these steps:\nHow to Install Light Bars\n\n1. Safety First\n\nMake sure to disconnect your battery before working on your vehicle\u2019s electrical systems.\n\n2. Install the Wiring Harness\n\nPut the wiring harness in the engine bay and approximate where you want the wiring to point.\n\n3. Decide Where You Want the Light Bar\n\nUse double-sided tape to mount the light bar to ensure you like the way that it looks. You also want to check to make sure that it is centered before drilling anything.\n\n4. Drill Your Holes\n\nAfter drilling, all you need to do is put the bolts in and make sure that everything is properly connected. Take the negative and positive wires and connect them to the light bar, then pass it through the firewall and connect to the on/off switch.\n\n5. Wire Up the Light Bar\n\nTake the positive wire and connect to the battery. Meanwhile, find a ground for the negative wire.\n\n6. Check Your Work\n\nReconnect your battery, then go ahead and test out the light bar.\nAfter this, you\u2019re ready to flip a switch and shine on.",

        "title": "How to Remove Car Stickers",
        "content": "Understanding the Surface\n\nDifferent techniques for how to get stickers off car parts are necessary with different surfaces.\n\nGlass, for instance, isn\u2019t porous but it is very smooth and adhesives can stick tightly, but it\u2019s also rather delicate to work with.\nPainted surfaces are even more delicate as the paint can separate from the metal underneath, and with the paint being porous, the adhesive can make it tough to separate.\nPlain or textured unpainted plastic is perhaps the easiest to remove stickers and decals, however, if they\u2019ve been on for some time, the plastic around it could\u2019ve faded badly.\n\n\u00a0What\u2019s more, if you aren\u2019t the person who installed the sticker, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s hiding underneath. It may have been strategically placed to cover a scratch or paint chip, and there may be a can of worms to deal with once the decal is gone.\n\nEssential Tools and Supplies\n\nYou\u2019ll need a few things to remove stickers properly. Depending on the surface, you may need some or all of the following:\n\nHeat gun\nAll-purpose cleaner or detailing spray\nGlass cleaner\nAdhesive remover or tar and road oil remover\nRazor scraper\nMicrofiber cloths\n\nMost of the products are straightforward, but choosing the right adhesive remover will make a significant difference in how well the job turns out. Select one that specifically says it\u2019s effective on the surface you\u2019re working on, and always follow the instructions on the product label. Also, test it on the same type of surface in an inconspicuous area before starting the job.\n\nStep-by-Step Sticker Removal Process\n\nStep 1: Heat the decal for removal\n\nMany decals are plastic-based with an adhesive on the backside. Use a heat gun to gently heat the decal to aid in removing it, passing the heat gun back and forth over the area you\u2019re treating, preventing any one area from getting too hot to touch. The heat helps to soften the adhesive so the decal will come off easier.\n\nStep 2: Remove the decal\n\nBegin peeling the decal off of the surface, being careful not to ensure that paint doesn\u2019t come off with it. Lubricate it with a detailing spray or cleaner and use a plastic razor scraper to help separate the sticker from the surface without damaging it. This step can be time-consuming if the decal is old and brittle or if it\u2019s a paper-based sticker, but keep at it until it\u2019s off.\n\nDealing with Residue\n\nWith the decal removed, spray or wipe your adhesive remover onto the remaining residue. Even if it looks like the decal came off completely, use adhesive remover to get off any last bits that might not be immediately visible. Let it sit as long as the product label recommends.\nOnce the adhesive residue has softened, you can use the plastic scraper to gently remove it, especially on glass. Use a microfiber cloth to gently wipe off and collect any bits of adhesive, then use glass cleaner to finish the task on your windshield or side windows and a detailing spray if it\u2019s on paint or plastic.\nIf there\u2019s any residue remaining after the first treatment, it may require subsequent treatments. It\u2019s not unusual to need two or more treatments, especially on old decals that have been on the vehicle for a long time.\n\nPreventing Damage to Paint\n\nTo ensure you don\u2019t damage paint when you\u2019re removing stickers, it\u2019s crucial to use heat, albeit very gently. Keep your heat gun on the lowest setting and only warm the decal until it starts to release from the paint when you pick at the edge. Overheating the paint will cause it to discolor or even burn or blister, making it a much larger project.\nPicking at the decal and pulling it with your fingers can work well on newer decals, but on some adhesives and aging decals, a scraper is necessary. When you use a scraper, ensure it\u2019s a plastic razor blade it\u2019s fitted with to avoid scratches in the paint. As well, keep the surface lubricated. When you use a detailing spray or glass cleaner on the decal as you scrape it, there\u2019s a buffer zone that helps to prevent scratches.\nAvoid being too aggressive with sticker removal. Slow and gentle is best for how to remove bumper stickers and other decals as pulling quickly often brings paint with it or tears the sticker, making it harder to get off.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Best Car Vacuum: Buying Guide 2023",
        "content": "Types of Car Vacuums\n\nWhen you explore the listings for car vacuums, you\u2019ll find three broad categories that they can be sorted under:\n\nUtility, or wet-dry canister vacuums, plug into household power. They feature a motor assembly that attaches to a compartment where dirt, dust, and other debris are collected for disposal. They can often be used with bags for dry applications, or they can be used bagless if you\u2019re cleaning up wet carpets or spills. These are among the most powerful options.\nHandheld vacuums, sometimes referred to as a \u2018dustbuster\u2019, are lightweight and have a built-in nozzle that funnels dirt up into a compartment where it\u2019s collected. They\u2019re extremely compact and nimble, meant for small clean-ups. They might be either a 12-volt plug-in or a battery-operated variety.\nBattery-powered vacuums are another common variety. Although there are options that have integrated batteries, many use separate rechargeable battery packs from power tools. They\u2019re not only useful for automotive cleaning but for worksite cleanup too.\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing a Car Vacuum\n\nWhen choosing a car vacuum, several factors should be considered to ensure you make the best choice for your needs.\u00a0\n\nPower \u2013 The most important aspect is how powerful it is. A more powerful vacuum will be able to pick up heavier debris and clean more thoroughly.\nCorded or cordless \u2013 Corded vacuums tend to be more powerful, but cordless vacuums offer greater maneuverability. If you choose a cordless vacuum, also consider the battery life.\nSize and weight \u2013 It\u2019s crucial to find a vacuum that\u2019s compact and light enough to maneuver around your car easily.\nAttachments \u2013 Look for a vacuum that comes with a variety of attachments like crevice tools or brush heads that make it easier to clean hard-to-reach areas and different surfaces.\nCapacity \u2013 Check the dirt cup capacity. A larger capacity means you won\u2019t have to empty it as often.\u00a0\nNoise \u2013 If noise is a concern for you, search for models that emphasize lower decibels.\nPrice \u2013 Of course, you\u2019ll need to consider your budget. More expensive models may have features like stronger suction or extra attachments.\nWet/dry capability \u2013 Some vacuums are capable of picking up both dry debris and liquids, which can be useful for cleaning up spills.\n\nUltimately, the more of these considerations you want, the more expensive the vacuum tends to be.\n\nBest Car Vacuums\n\nArmor All 2.5 Gallon Utility Vacuum\n\nIt\u2019s a fantastic little wet-dry vac from a company that\u2019s known for products to care for your car. The Armor All 2.5 Gallon Utility Vacuum comes with an eight-piece detailing kit and the accessories and nozzles can be stored onboard. It includes reusable filters, and the 6-foot hose is long enough to reach harder areas without much of an issue. It\u2019s inexpensive, and it comes extremely highly rated from previous purchasers.\u00a0\n\nProElite 14.8-Volt Rechargeable Car Vacuum\n\nWhen it\u2019s only a small spill you need to deal with, why bring out the big guns? The ProElite 14.8-Volt Rechargeable Car Vacuum is a compact device that barely weighs two pounds. It\u2019s ultra maneuverable and comes with a few different extensions and tips.

The Wagan 12-Volt Auto Vacuum has a 120-watt motor that draws dust, dirt, and even wet spills into the bagless reservoir. It plugs into the 12-volt power outlet, so there\u2019s no worry about a battery dying either. And while it comes with a brush tool and crevice tool, it can also double as an inflator for, say, when you\u2019re camping and need to blowup an air mattress.\n\nWagan 12-Volt Auto Vacuum\n\nBuy Now \n\nMaintenance and Care Tips for Car Vacuums\n\nAfter using your car vacuum, it\u2019s best to clean it out right away. Wet spills especially can get pretty smelly in a hurry, and you don\u2019t want to turn on the vacuum next time to discover it. If you have a unit that uses bags, make sure to change it when you begin to notice a lack of suction \u2013 that\u2019s often the cause.\nAnd if a battery-powered device is what you\u2019ve purchased, it\u2019s inconvenient to find out it\u2019s dead when you need it. Keep the battery charged up when it\u2019s not in use.\nAt an AutoZone near you, shop for all of your detailing supplies and equipment, including car vacuums. Not sure what will work for you?

        "title": "How to Get Tar Off Your Car",
        "content": "Understanding the Challenge of Tar Removal\n\nSeldom do you get the heads-up or the option to bypass roadwork, so getting tar on your car is inevitable. Why is it such a challenge to get if off? First, the tar is actually asphalt, and it\u2019s used as a binder for the aggregates used to build roads, so it\u2019s naturally extremely sticky. That only gets worse as it cools and dries. Next, it\u2019s time consuming. There are often hundreds of tiny speckles above wheel wells, on doors and quarter panels, and on rockers.\nAnd because it sticks so much, there\u2019s always a chance you could damage your paint trying to remove it. Careful work and chemicals that won\u2019t damage the surface are necessary.\n\nPreparing for Tar Removal\n\nGetting the job done properly will require a little bit of preparation.\n\nCollect the supplies. You\u2019ll need your preferred tar removal method, detailing or microfiber cloths, and your car wash soap, sponge, and wash bucket filled with warm water.\nWork in a cool, shaded area. Although heat will help soften the tar, a cool spot in the shade will be better for using cleaners and washing your car.\nMake note of the affected areas. Inspect your car for all of the areas where tar is present. You\u2019ll want to work panel by panel to methodically get it done.\nPay attention to the instructions. If you\u2019ve chosen a road oil and tar remover, know the steps to properly use it.\n\nMethods for Removing Tar from Your Car\n\nRegardless of which method you choose, always start with a freshly washed car. If there\u2019s any dirt, it\u2019ll act as an abrasive when you wipe the paint, causing scratches in the finish.\nThere are a handful of methods you can use to remove tar. They include:\n\nDedicated tar removers. There are plenty of products on the market from the top detailing suppliers that remove tar effectively. They contain products that counteract the bond between the asphalt and the paint, helping to dissolve small spots and soften others to be wiped away. Use them according the their unique instructions.\nWD\u201340. One of the many advertised uses for WD-40 is as a tar remover. It contains a solvent that fights against the petroleum-based asphalt so it can be wiped away. Spray or wipe it onto the affected area, wait 10 to 30 minutes, then wipe it off with a clean cloth.\nGoo Gone. This is a surprisingly effective product that doesn\u2019t use solvents, but rather, it uses citrus oils. Again, apply it liberally, then wipe it off after a short time with a soft, clean cloth.\nDecon soap. This professional detailing product is used to decontaminate paint. However, you\u2019ll need to take it to a professional detailer to get access to it.\nPeanut butter. Would you believe this delicious spread can get rid of road tar? It\u2019s true. Wipe some onto the tar spots, leave it for a bit, then wipe it off.\n\nNo matter what method you choose, make sure you clean the area afterward with soap and water to get rid of residue.\n\nTips for Safe and Efficient Tar Removal\n\nBe prepared for a process that\u2019s going to take some time, and it\u2019s a delicate process to complete without damaging your paint. Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nStick with car-safe products. Don\u2019t use household cleaners that could potentially damage your car\u2019s finish \u2013 they might be too harsh.\nTest your solution first. Always pick an inconspicuous area on your car to try out your tar removal solution. You don\u2019t want discoloration or damage.\nBe patient. Even for the most efficient methods, it takes time to complete. Rushing the job can mean more physical effort, or you may have to do a second treatment.\nWax your car afterward. Most tar removal products will also strip off wax that\u2019s under the tar. Protect your finish with a fresh coat of wax.\n\nPreventing Future Tar Build-Up\n\nThat layer of wax you\u2019ve just applied after tar removal? It\u2019s a barrier that will help prevent tar from sticking to your car quite as badly next time. Other helpful preventions can be ceramic coatings that include hydrophobic properties.\nIf you\u2019re getting tar on your car often, make sure you clean it regularly. And installing a set of mudflaps can keep tar away from the paint as much as possible while also improving your car\u2019s looks.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "The Best Ceramic Coatings for Your Car in 2023",
        "content": "Factors to Consider When Choosing a Ceramic Coating\n\nWith so many options available on the market, it can be challenging to choose the right ceramic coating for your needs. These are the key factors you should consider when selecting a ceramic coating.\n\nDurability\n\nOne of the primary reasons for applying a ceramic coating is to protect your car\u2019s paint from elements like UV rays, bird droppings, and acid rain. Durability should be a top consideration when selecting a ceramic coating.\nDifferent ceramic coatings offer varying degrees of durability, ranging from about three months up to 5+ years. The longevity of the coating will depend on factors such as the quality of the product, how well you follow instructions for the application, and your car\u2019s exposure to environmental conditions.\n\nEase of Application\n\nSome ceramic coatings can be applied by DIYers, while others may require professional installation. DIY-friendly coatings generally come in the form of sprays or wipes, making them easy to apply without any specialized equipment, but DIYers can also use liquids \u2013 it\u2019s just more complex.\n\nCuring Time\n\nCuring time refers to the amount of time it takes for the ceramic coating to bond with your car\u2019s paint and reach its full potential in terms of protection and shine. This can range from a few hours to several days, depending on the product. If you need your car to be ready for use as soon as possible, look for a ceramic coating with a shorter curing time. However, keep in mind that coatings with longer curing times may offer better durability and protection in the long run.\n\nCost\n\nPrices can vary significantly depending on factors such as the brand, durability, and the type of application \u2013 spray, wipe, or liquid. While it might be tempting to go for the cheapest option, weigh the cost against the benefits you\u2019ll receive from the coating. A more expensive ceramic coating may provide better protection, longevity, and shine, ultimately saving you money on paint correction and maintenance down the line.\n\nTop 5 Best Ceramic Coatings for Your Car\n\nMeguiar\u2019s Hybrid Ceramic Wax Spray\n\nMeguiar\u2019s Hybrid Ceramic Wax Spray offers a simple spray-on, rinse-off application for an effortless ceramic wax experience. Its unique blend of SiO2 and polymers provides impressive water beading and long-lasting protection.

        "title": "How Does a Waterless Car Wash Work?",
        "content": "What is a Waterless Car Wash?\n\nA waterless car wash is an eco-friendly and efficient car washing method that uses little to no water. Instead of using gallons of water to clean your vehicle, waterless car wash products use high-lubricity sprays to polish and wash the car\u2019s surface. These sprays encapsulate dirt particles, making it easier to remove them without scratching the paint.\nKeep in mind that waterless car wash isn\u2019t meant to remove mud, tar, or any other substance that\u2019s stuck to the paint. It\u2019s for light dust, water spots, and spot touch-ups when your car is close to clean.\n\nTypes of Waterless Car Wash Products\n\nWaterless car wash products have become increasingly popular for their ease of use and eco-friendliness. These types of products are designed to clean your car\u2019s surface without using a lot of water, or none at all. There are several different types of waterless car wash products available on the market, with each type having its advantages and disadvantages:\n\nSprays. Waterless car wash sprays are the most popular type of cleaning solution used for waterless washing. They apply a fine mist of soapy cleaning agents to the car\u2019s surface, which helps to trap dirt and grime, making it easier to wipe away. Most of these sprays apply cleaning agents, waxes, and oils simultaneously, which enhances their cleaning and protection.\nFoams. Foams are also an effective waterless car wash solution. They work in the same way as sprays, lifting and encapsulating dirt and grime, allowing for quick and easy removal. Foams are particularly useful for cleaning wheels and tires, as they stick to dirt and grime in a way that sprays may struggle.\nWipes. Waterless car wash wipes are a great on-the-go solution for car cleaning. They are pre-moistened wipes that come in small travel-sized packages, perfect for people who trailer long distances and want to keep their car clean all through the journey, or if you need a quick touch-up.\nKits. Waterless car wash kits are complete packages that come with everything you need to get started, including a spray or wipe solution, microfiber towels, and sometimes even carrying cases.\n\nWhat\u2019s best for your situation depends on how you plan to use it, as well as if you have a brand loyalty.\n\nHow Does a Waterless Car Wash Work?\n\nWaterless car washes typically contain a blend of chemicals and compounds like surfactants, lubricants, emulsifiers, and polymers. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid, helping to lift dirt and grime from the car\u2019s surface. Lubricants reduce friction between the car\u2019s surface and the cloth you\u2019re using to wipe it down, which helps to prevent scratches. Emulsifiers help to dissolve stubborn dirt, oil, and grease, making it easier to wipe away. Polymers create a protective layer over the car\u2019s surface, which helps to repel substances from sticking in the future.\nWhen sprayed onto the car\u2019s surface, the waterless car wash product encapsulates the dirt and dust and lifts it away from the paint.\n\nBenefits of Using a Waterless Car Wash\n\nWhy use a waterless spray wash for cars? There are several advantages, including:\n\nSaving water. Traditional car washes can use up to 100 gallons of water per wash. With a waterless car wash, you\u2019ll reduce your water consumption a lot.\nSaving time and money. Waterless car washes are quick and easy to use, allowing you to clean your car faster than a wand wash. Plus, you\u2019ll save money on water bills and car wash fees.\nVersatility. Waterless car wash products can be used on all kinds of surfaces including paint, glass, chrome, and plastic.\nPaint protection. With compounds to help prevent scratches, your car will look better for longer.\nNo need for a water source. Since you don\u2019t need a hose or bucket of water, you can clean your car anywhere \u2013 perfect for apartment owners or those without access to a water source.\n\nWaterless car washes are an innovative and eco-friendly alternative to traditional car washing methods. By using these products, you can save time, money, and the environment while still keeping your car looking its best.",

        "title": "The Benefits of Ceramic Coating for Your Car",
        "content": "What is Ceramic Coating?\n\nCeramic coatings are liquid polymers that bond chemically with your vehicle\u2019s factory paint once applied and cured. These coatings consist primarily of silica (silicon dioxide) and other nano-ceramic particles, which create a semi-permanent, transparent, and hydrophobic layer on the vehicle\u2019s surface.\nThis protective layer is typically much harder and more resistant to environmental contaminants than traditional waxes or sealants. It still applies similarly to a traditional car wax, but the results literally outshine the more time-consuming processes of polishing and waxing a vehicle.\n\nBenefits of Ceramic Coating\n\nThere are several advantages to applying a ceramic coating to your vehicle, including:\n\nProtection from UV rays. Prolonged exposure to the sun\u2019s UV rays can cause oxidation and fading of your vehicle\u2019s paint. Ceramic coatings provide a shield against these harmful rays, preserving your car\u2019s original color and preventing premature aging.\n\nChemical resistance. The protective layer created by a ceramic coating is resistant to harsh chemicals such as bird droppings, tree sap, and acid rain which can etch your vehicle\u2019s clear coat and damage the paint.\n\nHydrophobic properties. Ceramic coatings exhibit hydrophobic properties, meaning they repel water. When a coated surface comes into contact with water, it beads up and rolls off, taking dirt and grime with it. This self-cleaning effect makes washing your car easier and less frequent.\n\nEnhanced gloss and shine. A ceramic coating enhances your vehicle\u2019s appearance by making the color look sharper and shinier. The high-gloss finish can make your car look as if it just rolled out of the showroom.\n\nScratch resistance. While ceramic coatings are not entirely scratch-proof, they do provide a level of resistance to minor scratches and swirl marks that can occur from improper washing techniques or daily wear and tear.\n\nChoosing a Ceramic Coating\n\nWith the increasing popularity of ceramic coatings, there are numerous products available on the market, each claiming to offer the best protection for your vehicle. So, how do you choose the right one? These tips can help.\n\nDurability and Longevity\n\nOne of the primary reasons for applying a ceramic coating is to provide long-lasting protection for your vehicle\u2019s paint. Coatings vary in terms of durability, with some lasting only a few months, while others can last several years. When selecting a ceramic coating, consider how often you\u2019re willing to reapply the product and whether you prefer a semi-permanent solution or a shorter-term option.\n\nEase of Application\n\nSome ceramic coatings are more user-friendly than others, especially for those who are new to the process. If you plan to apply the coating yourself, look for products that are easy to apply and provide clear instructions.\n\nCost\n\nCeramic coatings can vary significantly in price, from budget-friendly options to premium, high-end products. It\u2019s essential to determine your budget before selecting a ceramic coating. Keep in mind that while more expensive coatings may offer better performance and durability, they may not be the best fit for you.\n\nBrand Reputation\n\nWhen choosing a ceramic coating, research and select a reputable brand. Look for companies with positive reviews and testimonials, as well as a proven track record in the industry.\n\nEnvironmental Considerations\n\nDepending on where you live and the environmental conditions your vehicle is exposed to, you may want to choose a ceramic coating that offers specific protection against certain elements. For instance, if your car is frequently exposed to harsh sunlight, look for a product that provides excellent UV resistance. Similarly, if you live in an area with heavy snow or rain, a coating with strong hydrophobic properties is a good plan.\n\nCompatibility with Your Paint\n\nLastly, ensure that the ceramic coating you choose is compatible with your vehicle\u2019s paint type and finish. Some coatings may not adhere well to certain surfaces like matte paint or may react negatively with specific paint types.",

        "title": "Best Car Wax: Buying Guide for 2023",
        "content": "Why Car Wax is Important\u00a0\n\nWhile many people associate waxing a car with just enhancing its appearance, car wax actually plays a critical role in car maintenance. The primary function of car wax is to protect the paint on your car from damage. Your car\u2019s paint is constantly exposed to UV rays from the sun, environmental pollutants, and other debris on the road. Over time, this can cause the paint to fade, peel, or wear.\nCar wax provides a protective layer that can repel water, dust, and other debris that can cause damage to the paint like corrosion. It also helps water to bead off and prevents substances from sticking to your painted finish.\n\nThe Different Types of Car Wax\n\nGenerally, you can break down any car wax into one of three categories:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCarnauba wax is a natural wax that comes from the leaves of the Brazilian carnauba palm tree. It produces a deep, rich shine that can make your car look like new. It also has excellent water-repellent properties that can protect your car\u2019s paint from rain and other moisture. One drawback of carnauba wax is that it doesn\u2019t last as long as synthetic or hybrid waxes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSynthetic wax is made from man-made materials like polymers. One of the most significant advantages of synthetic wax is that it lasts longer than carnauba wax because it bonds better with your car\u2019s paint, providing excellent protection against UV rays, dirt, and other road debris. This type of wax usually provides a high-gloss shine, but it may not produce the same deep, wet look as carnauba wax.\u00a0\nHybrid wax is a combination of both synthetic and carnauba waxes. It\u2019s designed to provide the longevity and protection of synthetic wax with the glossy shine of Carnauba wax. Hybrid wax is usually easier to apply than carnauba wax and lasts longer too. It also provides excellent UV protection, water-repellent properties, and a deep, wet-look shine. However, hybrid wax can be more expensive than synthetic or Carnauba wax, and it may not provide the same level of protection against scratches and scuffs as a synthetic wax.\u00a0\n\nBenefits of Using Car Wax\n\nCar wax is a powerful tool for protecting your vehicle\u2019s paint and keeping it looking new. While it\u2019s true that car wax can enhance the appearance of your car, its benefits go much deeper.\n\nProtection\n\nWax acts as a barrier between your car\u2019s paint and the elements including acid rain, bug guts, and other contaminants. Wax also helps prevent water spots, bird droppings, and tree sap from damaging the paint. Applying car wax regularly can keep your car\u2019s paint looking new.\n\nShine\n\nCar wax gives your vehicle a beautiful, glossy finish. When your car is freshly waxed, it has a mirror-like quality that reflects light and makes it shine. Wax fills in microscopic scratches and imperfections, creating a smooth surface, making the paint appear brighter and deeper.\u00a0\n\nLongevity\nAnother significant benefit of car wax is its ability to extend the life of your vehicle\u2019s paint. As your car ages, the paint can become dull and faded. Wax helps protect the paint from the sun\u2019s harmful UV rays, which can cause the color to fade. By forming a barrier, wax helps prevent oxidation that can cause the paint to peel or crack.\n\nCost-effectiveness\n\nApplying car wax regularly may seem like a small expense, but it can save you money in the long run. Regular waxing can save you from having to perform bodywork or a paint job. It also helps retain your car\u2019s value by keeping it looking new and well-maintained.\n\nFactors to Consider When Choosing Car Wax\n\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for car wax, not all products are going to be suited for your application. Some will work better than others, so you need to know what to consider. Think about:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe type of paint you have. If your car has a clear coat, it can withstand a slightly abrasive wax better than a car with only paint layers.\u00a0\n\nThe climate you\u2019re in. Most car waxes need to be applied in comfortable t-shirt conditions. If it\u2019s either too hot or too cold, it could make the application inconsistent or more difficult.\u00a0\nHow and where you use your car. Some waxes are quick and easy to apply but don\u2019t last as long, and vice versa.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTop Car Wax Products\n\nTurtle Wax Hybrid Solutions Ceramic Acrylic Black Wax\n\nIf you drive a black car and want a deep, glossy shine, then Turtle Wax Hybrid Solutions Ceramic Acrylic Black Wax is a great choice. It fills in light scratches with the acrylic component it has and prevents water from beading thanks to its ceramic content. The carnauba wax it contains \u2013 it\u2019s a hybrid, like the name says \u2013 is pigmented black so it makes the black finish really pop.\n\nMeguiar\u2019s M7 Mirror Glaze Show Car Glaze\n\nGetting five-star reviews from buyers, this Show Car Glaze car wax from Meguiar\u2019s Mirror Glaze line DIYers a professional-grade look.

        "title": "Benefits of Waxing Your Car",
        "content": "Top Benefits of Waxing your Car\n\nApplied properly to the whole vehicle, following the instructions on the container, most types of wax can last for three to six months before a reapplication is necessary. And while the coating is in good shape, these are the top benefits you\u2019ll see.\n\nProtects from scratches\n\nWax might be an invisible, microscopically-thin layer on your car\u2019s painted surface, but it\u2019s a powerful protectant against light abrasions and scratches. It acts as a slippery surface and, when a material comes into light contact with the paint, it can allow it to glide over top rather than dig into the clear coat or paint. A mark can often be left behind that rubs out since it\u2019s only affected the wax.\nKeep in mind that any moderate or firm pressure is likely to cut right through the soft wax layer and into the paint, so it might not be feasible to expect it to repel car keys in the hand of an enemy.\n\nA barrier from dirt\n\nWhile you can\u2019t see it, a car\u2019s paint job has microscopic pores and is rougher than you\u2019d expect. Dust and dirt can attach to the rough surface relatively easily. But when you wax your car, the surface is smoother, more consistent, and slick. Dirt and grime have a more difficult time attaching to the surface.\nAs a result, your car looks cleaner for longer. This effect is best immediately after waxing your car, and as time passes, the soft wax coating wears away and allows dirt to get a grip. When that happens, it\u2019s one of the signs it\u2019s nearly time to wax your car again.\n\nRepels water\n\nAfter waxing your car, you\u2019ll notice that water droplets bead and run off the surface. Wax is considered hydrophobic, meaning it repels water. Atomically, wax has a polar charge opposite to water, so it\u2019s like two magnets opposing each other.\nThat\u2019s especially helpful since most dirt, mud and other grime are waterborne, so they are repelled also.\u00a0\n\nProtects against corrosion\n\nThe small pores in your car\u2019s paint can allow moisture to penetrate under the surface and corrode the metal underneath. And if you have a scratch, exposure to air and moisture will make it oxidize and rust. When you apply wax over top, it seals both the moisture and air out, keeping the metal surfaces underneath safe from corrosion. Those properties dissipate as the wax layer wears away with exposure and car washes, which is why routine waxing is necessary.\n\nKeeps your car\u2019s finish shiny\n\nAnd of course, the gleaming shine of a fresh wax application is a huge benefit for most car owners. Especially right after it\u2019s applied, the smooth waxed surface has a mirror-like reflection that can make a paint job look good as new, hiding the swirl marks and imperfections from view for a time.\n\nHow to maintain your wax\n\nWashing your car often is absolutely essential to maintaining your car waxing. Use a pH-neutral soap solution with warm water and a soft microfiber cloth. When you dry it, use a different, clean microfiber or chamois. You should also avoid using harsh chemicals when washing your vehicle since these may strip off protective layers from the surface, and the abrasiveness of an automatic car wash with brushes can wear it off quickly.\nEven though waxing itself isn\u2019t necessary every time you wash the car, it\u2019s still important to make sure that you rinse off any remaining soap residue after cleaning. Otherwise, leftover traces of soap could act like sandpaper and cause more damage than good. For optimal results, try using a quick detailing spray during this step as these products contain unique ingredients like polymers that helps add some extra gloss to surfaces in just minutes.\nWhenever possible, keep your vehicle in shaded areas whenever possible as too much exposure to direct sunlight can cause premature fading due to UV light exposure. Remember that sun reflects off surfaces so even nearby trees or buildings may not provide enough shade.",

        "title": "How to Remove Odor from Inside of Your Car",
        "content": "Understanding the Causes of Car Odors\n\nThe odors inside your car can come from a variety of sources, including smoke, food, sweat, pets, and other organic materials. Over time, these odors can build up to become overwhelming and unpleasant to smell. Understanding the source of these smells is key to getting rid of them effectively.\n\nCigarette Smoke\n\nCigarette smoke is one of the most common sources of unpleasant smells inside cars. The chemical particles in cigarette smoke can bond to various surfaces such as carpets and upholstery, making it difficult to remove even after the source has been removed.\n\nFood and Sweat\n\nFood residues left in your car over time can cause lingering odors that can be hard to remove with just air fresheners or sprays. Sweat also acts as an attractor for dust, dirt, and other particles that can make odors stick around and worsen over time.\n\nPets\n\nPets are another common source of unpleasant smells inside cars. Pet hair and dander trap dirt and moisture which can lead to bacteria growth that causes musty odors. Additionally, pet urine may penetrate through the carpeting or upholstery leading to even stronger-smelling odors that are difficult to remove.\n\nSpills\n\nSome substances like coffee won\u2019t smell if they\u2019re spilled, but if a carton of milk leaks, it\u2019s bound to make your interior a terrible place to be, especially if it\u2019s gone unnoticed in warm weather. The fatty component in dairy, as well as meats and certain other foods, becomes almost intolerable and notoriously difficult to eradicate.\n\nMildew\n\nMoisture can cause bacteria and mildew to form, and that\u2019s especially true in the HVAC system. The cabin air filter and ductwork can house mildew that is hard to access, and it gets bad whenever the temperature and humidity increase.\n\nMethods for Removing Car Odors\nA majority of bad smells inside your car come from organic sources within soft surfaces, particularly the carpeting and the upholstery. They can also come from hidden substances that turn putrid, like spoiled food under a seat, spilled milk that seeps into the spare tire well, or mildew in the air vents.\nHaving an unpleasant smell in your car can be a major annoyance, but there are several steps you can take to get rid of the odor. Here are some tips on how to effectively remove odors from your car.\n\n1. Air Out the Interior\n\nGetting fresh air into your car can help replace stale air and remove odors. This can be accomplished by simply opening the windows or using a fan or portable air freshener. Using an ozone generator is also an effective way to deodorize as it helps eliminate bacteria and other pollutants in the air.\n\n2. Clean Surfaces\n\nCleaning all interior surfaces on a regular basis is essential for removing odors from your car. Vacuuming will help remove dirt and debris from carpets, while wiping down hard surfaces with cleaning wipes or a damp cloth will help remove dirt and sweat residue that may have built up over time.\nSteam cleaning may help remove especially stubborn pet odors from carpets and fabrics, and an odor neutralizer intended for smoke is often needed to treat cigarette smells. Sprinkle baking soda or spray an upholstery cleaner onto the smelly area for a few hours before steam cleaning to make it even more effective.\n\n3. Disinfect Air Vents\n\nAir vents are often overlooked when it comes to removing odors from cars but they should not be ignored. Smells attach to the interior of the ducts, and a duct odor eliminator is how to get mildew smell out of car, treating these substances to neutralize them.\nIf you have a cabin air filter, change it too. It can house mildew and other bacteria that contribute to odors.\n\n4. Strip the Carpets and Seats Out\n\nSometimes, all your best efforts aren\u2019t enough without getting serious about cleaning. It\u2019s not unheard of to remove the seats and carpets from the car to clean them thoroughly. That can entail pressure washing the carpets and shampooing every visible and hidden side of the seats, letting them dry completely, then re-installing them in the car.\n\nTips for Preventing Car Odors\n\nSome odors can\u2019t be avoided, but others definitely can. Tips to prevent bad smells include:\u00a0\n\nKeep your interior tidy. Take food containers, dirty clothes, and other junk out of your car regularly.\nClean routinely. Frequently vacuuming and wiping down the interior can prevent buildup of organic material that can cause odors.\nPut your groceries on a cargo mat. Rotten food smells can be particularly troublesome, so catch any spills on a cargo mat for easy cleanup.\n\nBest Practices for Maintaining a Fresh-Smelling Car\n\nIf you want your car to smell fantastic all the time \u2013 and not just to treat or cover up a bad smell \u2013 there are some excellent methods you can put into practice.\nDon\u2019t eat or drink in your vehicle if you can avoid it. You\u2019re inviting a spill simply by having food in there. The same goes for smoking \u2013 even with a window open, cigarette smells can get embedded in fabrics.\nPlace dryer sheets under your seats to add a fresh, crisp scent. And if you want to avoid odors from a wide range of sources, place a container of coffee beans, charcoal, or an odor-eating sponge in your car.\u00a0 Some people also appreciate the natural scents of essential oils diffused in their vehicle.",

        "title": "What\u2019s the Difference Between Interior Detailing vs Cleaning?",
        "content": "Understanding Interior Detailing\n\nInterior detailing is the process of thoroughly cleaning and restoring the interior of your car. It goes beyond a basic vacuuming to clean hard-to-reach areas, dirt and grime buildup, and dust particles within the car.\nInterior detailing is often recommended for vehicles that are older or have been neglected from regular maintenance. This type of detail can involve cleaning in spots like between seats and down air vents. It can also include:\n\nShampooing and steam cleaning carpets, upholstery, and panels\nConditioning leather surfaces\nCleaning all of the glass inside\nTreating the interior for odors\nDeep cleaning soft and hard plastics and vinyl such as dashboards and center consoles\nPolishing scratches\nApplying a coat of wax\nAnd even restoring headlight lenses\n\nIt\u2019s the type of deep clean that takes several hours to complete and requires equipment like an upholstery cleaner, polishing equipment, and a range of wipes, cloths, and sprays.\n\nUnderstanding Interior Cleaning\n\nBasic interior car cleaning is the process of restoring a vehicle\u2019s interior to a clean state. It involves vacuuming, wiping down and dusting surfaces, getting rid of clutter and garbage, and spot-cleaning any areas that might have extra dirt or grime.\nThis type of detail is ideal if you need to maintain the cleanliness of your car or don\u2019t have time for a full interior detail. You can also use basic interior car cleaning as a maintenance step in between deeper detailing sessions.\nBasic car cleaning is also great for those who are on a budget and want to keep their cars looking nice without spending too much money or time. This kind of detail helps remove surface-level dirt and debris, refresh upholstery, eliminate odors, and gives your vehicle an overall clean look. Additionally, doing regular basic cleaning can prevent major messes from accumulating \u2013 which means less work when it\u2019s time to really deep clean your car!\nWhether you\u2019re trying to maintain the cleanliness of your car before selling it or just want it to look its best \u2013 interior car cleaning is an important part of keeping your ride looking sharp.\n\nBenefits of Interior Detailing and Cleaning\n\nFirst, the obvious benefit of detailing or cleaning your car is the difference in appearance. It\u2019s like starting with a clean slate again, and the impact on your mood is remarkable. Then, there are other benefits that are just as important:\u00a0\n\nRemoving dirt, dust, and other allergens can help you breathe easier when you\u2019re in your car.\nCleaning your windows helps you see better in traffic \u2013 and it helps prevent condensation from forming.\nIt removes aggregate from the carpets, touch points, and upholstery that can cause premature abrasion wear.\u00a0\nIt helps eliminate odors from unseen sources.\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd it helps you keep your car looking good as long as possible.\n\nGoing more in-depth with interior detailing gives you greater benefits than a basic cleaning, but it\u2019s beneficial regardless.\n\nWhen to Choose Interior Detailing vs Cleaning\n\nThis kind of detail is especially important if you\u2019re planning on selling your vehicle or trading it in for a newer model. A thorough interior clean will not only give a good impression to prospective buyers but also keep your car\u2019s resale value high.\u00a0\u00a0\nAdditionally, if you\u2019re an avid car enthusiast who loves restoring their ride back to its original glory, this type of detailing can be incredibly satisfying! Interior detailing can help you achieve that \u201cnew car look\u201d without needing to buy new parts or pieces entirely.\u00a0\nBut if you simply need to restore some sort of semblance of order in your car, giving it a once-over cleaning is still a good idea. Again, an interior cleaning should be done often in between major interior detailing services, and you\u2019ll even need to do a deep clean less often because of it.",

        "title": "When is the Best Time to Wax Your Car?",
        "content": "When is the best time to wax your car?\n\nWhen it comes to waxing your car, timing is everything. Different types of cars require different procedures at different times throughout the year. There are two main reasons why it\u2019s important to understand when the best time is to wax your car:\n\nThe temperature and humidity levels affect how quickly the product dries,\nAnd the proper prep work for a good seal will ensure that dirt won\u2019t stick in the long run.\n\nFor most cars, it\u2019s best to do a full-body wax job twice per year: once at the start of spring and again at the end of summer. This will help protect against both cold weather damage as well as heat damage from direct sunlight exposure.\nYou can use a clay bar before applying a paste or liquid wax in order to remove any debris that might have settled onto your vehicle\u2019s surface during periods of non-use. Additionally, there are some areas of the vehicle that may require frequent maintenance such as door jambs since regular use scuffs the wax off. These areas should be attended to more frequently \u2013 at least every few months.\n\nIs it better to wax your car in the summer or winter?\nDuring colder months it\u2019s not typically recommended that you apply wax as low temperatures can cause streaks or smears on the paint. The wax doesn\u2019t become bond to the paint well enough, and it\u2019s hard to spread evenly. Unless you have a place where your car can sit and warm up, stay clean, and is bright enough to apply the wax, the conditions simply aren\u2019t ideal for applying wax.\nAdding a layer of protection by waxing during hotter months can prevent fading caused by UV light exposure, and the same protection is true for winter driving. It\u2019s also excellent for repelling ice and snow from sticking to your car. So, while it\u2019s not a fantastic plan to wax a car in the winter, getting a layer applied just before the cold weather blows in is a great idea.\n\nShould you wax your car when it\u2019s wet?\n\nCan you still wax your car when it\u2019s wet? The answer is yes \u2013 but make sure you\u2019re using high quality products designed specifically for this purpose as regular liquid or paste wax won\u2019t adhere properly, leading to smearing and streaking on painted surfaces.\u00a0\nA specialized hydrophobic product will instead bond with water molecules allowing it to dry without leaving behind streaks while also creating a protective layer over each one of them that helps keep dirt away.\n\nIdeal conditions for waxing your car\n\nApplying car wax is best done in dry, mild temperatures between 59\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F (15\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C). Waxing a car in higher temperatures can be difficult, as the wax may dry too quickly and cause streaking. Likewise, when applied in cooler temperatures, the wax can be difficult to remove when you try to wipe it off with your microfiber cloth, leaving behind a cloudy residue on the surface of your car. It\u2019s also important to make sure that you avoid applying car wax in direct sunlight or under strong artificial light sources. Doing so will both reduce how long the wax lasts and make it more difficult for you to properly spread out and wipe off the wax afterwards since it dries too quickly. You\u2019ll also use much more wax than normal.\nTo prep for waxing, it\u2019s also helpful if you give your car a good wash beforehand since dirt and debris can interfere with how well the product bonds with your vehicle\u2019s paintwork. And anything that can act as an abrasive can cause scratches that become visible when the wax later comes off, making your car look even worse than originally.\nFor optimal results, timing matters. So, plan accordingly depending on what type of weather lies ahead. And if you choose to take advantage of wet conditions, don\u2019t forget to use specialized hydrophobic products otherwise regular liquid or paste wax could lead to unsatisfactory results.",

        "content": "Check your windshield wiper blades\u00a0\n\nCheck your windsheild wipers\nWiper blades can freeze to the windshield in a snowstorm, and ice and snow on the glass can act as an abrasive on the rubber edge. Check along the flexible rubber edge of each wiper blade for nicks and cuts. If you see damage, or if your wipers leave streaks behind after a pass, replace them both.\n\nInspect and top up the fluids\u00a0\n\nInspect and top fluids\nFluids can have moisture intrude or form from cycles between hot and cold temperatures. Contamination can occur, and oils can break down and lose viscosity. Check the color and level of each fluid including:\n\nEngine oil\nTransmission fluid\nEngine coolant\nBrake fluid\nPower steering fluid\nOn 4WD and AWD vehicles, differential and transfer case fluids\n\nIf they\u2019re in poor condition, flush and fill them with the appropriate fluids. Also, top up the windshield washer fluid.\n\nCheck the air filters\n\nCheck the air filters\nAlthough dust storms and bugs aren\u2019t the norm in the winter, the air still carries particles that will get caught in the air filters. Inspect the engine air filter as well as the cabin air filter to ensure they aren\u2019t coated in debris. Check that light passes through the pleats, indicating that air can still make its way through efficiently too. If the filters are dirty, smelly, or you can\u2019t see light through them, replace them. It\u2019s usually necessary every year as part of your vehicle maintenance schedule.\n\nTest the battery\n\nTest the Battery\n\nCheck the brakes\n\nCheck the brakes\nAs summer approaches, your brakes will need to be in good condition to bring your vehicle to a halt, and higher temperatures can cause brake pads and rotors to wear a little faster too. Make sure you\u2019re starting the season out right and that your brake pads have at least 3/16ths of an inch remaining at each wheel for both the inboard and outboard pad. Brake rotors shouldn\u2019t be gouged, and they shouldn\u2019t have ridges or pockmarks of rust on either side. If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process. Spark plugs, ignition cables, and fluid flushes may be due. It\u2019s best to follow the maintenance schedule provided by the manufacturer for major services.\nIf you complete the items on this spring car checklist, you\u2019ll help minimize the overall cost of repairs and prevent untimely issues from occurring.

        "title": "How to Remove Water Spots on a Car",
        "content": "Why do Water Spots Form on a Car?\n\nWater spots on a car can form in a few different ways. The first is when water containing minerals such as calcium and magnesium dries on the surface of the car. The minerals are left behind and can create a visible spot. Hard water is a common culprit and is water that has a high naturally occurring mineral content. When it dries, it can leave mineral deposits on the car\u2019s surface. What\u2019s worse, the hardened minerals can be more difficult to remove than a thick layer of dirt in many cases.\nAdditionally, even if the water is pure, the water can pick up dirt and grime if the car\u2019s surface is dirty, leaving behind a spot when it dries. The same situation happens in reverse too where dust carried by the wind can settle onto your clean, wet car.\nAlso, water spots could be etched into the paint. Corrosive substances like acid rain can erode microscopic layers of the paint, leaving behind hazy droplet-sized spots.\n\nHow to Identify Water Stains\n\nWater spots on your car appear as small, circular marks that are lighter in color than the surrounding paint. They can be raised or slightly indented and may have a rough texture. They are often found on the hood, roof, and trunk of a car as well as on windows and mirrors. In some cases, they can also form on your car\u2019s wheels and tires and tend to develop near the edges of a window or on the bottom of a door too.\nThey can also be identified by the fact that they are not easily removed with regular washing and they will appear again after washing the car.\n\nHow to Remove Water Spots\n\nThere are several methods for how to get rid of water spots on car paint, depending on the type and severity of the spot. Always start with a freshly washed car, and dry it with microfiber towels or a chamois. Here are a few methods that can be used.\n\n1. Clay bar\n\nA clay bar can be used to gently remove surface contaminants, including water spots, from the paint of a car. Mist the section you\u2019re working on with detailing spray or water and work the clay bar over the area. You\u2019ll feel a difference in drag as the spots come off. Finish up with a rinse and wipe dry.\nThis method will also remove any other contaminants stuck to your paint, but it\u2019s not a good idea if there\u2019s rust or any loose paint or clear coat.\n\n2. Soap and water\n\nA mixture of mild car soap and warm water can be used to gently scrub away water spots from hard water or dust and dirt. A microfiber towel or a soft-bristled brush can be used to apply the soap and water to the spots, then rinse it and wipe dry. You\u2019ll need to use elbow grease and it might take a few tries to completely remove the water spots.\n\n3. Vinegar\n\nA solution of equal parts white vinegar and water can be applied to water spots with a microfiber towel or a soft-bristled brush. The solution should be allowed to sit on the spots for a few minutes before being rinsed off with water.\nThis method is ideal for hard water spots as the acidic vinegar will help dissolve the minerals.\n\n4. Baking soda\n\nA paste made from baking soda and water can be applied to water spots and allowed to sit for a few minutes before being rinsed off with water. If your water spots might\u2019ve come from bird droppings, tree sap, or acid rain, the baking soda can help neutralize them.\nUnfortunately, if it\u2019s etched into the paint already, you\u2019ll likely need to cut and polish the paint to remove the spots completely.\n\nDetailing Products\n\nYou can find specialized water spot remover for cars available on the market that can be used to remove water spots. These products should be used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nTypically, it\u2019s the same as a waterless car wash. Spray the water spot remover or detailing spray onto a microfiber cloth or applicator and wipe the car\u2019s surface. You can also spray directly onto the paint and wipe it dry with a clean towel.\nAlso, car polish is often successful at removing water spots since there\u2019s a mild abrasive in the compound.",

        "content": "Why should you use a clay bar\n\nA clay bar is a detailing tool used to remove contaminants from the surface of your vehicle\u2019s paint, glass, fiberglass, and metal. These contaminants can include:\u00a0\n\nDirt\u00a0\nGrime\u00a0\nIndustrial fallout\u00a0\nBrake dust\u00a0\nBug guts\u00a0\nRoad tar\u00a0\nAnd tree sap\u00a0\n\nUsing a clay bar can help to restore the smoothness and shine to your vehicle\u2019s paint by removing these contaminants, which can make the surface feel rough or dull. It is a quick and effective way to prepare a vehicle for waxing or polishing, and can also help to improve the overall appearance of the vehicle.\u00a0\nHow does clay bar work? As the elastic clay passes over particles on the paint, it catches on them and pulls them free. It traps the contaminants in the clay so they don\u2019t get deposited back onto the car or anywhere else the clay is used.\u00a0\nIt is important to note that a clay bar should not be used on a heavily damaged or severely oxidized paint finish, as it may not be effective in removing these types of imperfections. In these cases, it may be necessary to use more aggressive methods, such as wet sanding or compound polishing, to restore the surface.\u00a0\n\nHow often should you use a clay bar\n\nThe frequency with which you should use a clay bar will depend on the condition of your vehicle\u2019s paint and the level of contaminants present. In general, it is a good idea to use a clay bar at least once a year to help maintain the smoothness and shine of your vehicle\u2019s paint.\u00a0\nIf you live in an area with a lot of road grime or near railway tracks, or if you frequently drive on gravel roads or in heavy traffic, you may want to use a clay bar more frequently. In these cases, you may want to use a clay bar every six to twelve months to help keep your vehicle\u2019s paint in good condition.\u00a0\nOn the other hand, if you live in a relatively clean environment and don\u2019t drive your vehicle very often, you may be able to go longer periods of time between clay bar treatments. In these cases, you may only need to use a clay bar every one to two years.\u00a0\nUltimately, the best way to determine how often to use a clay bar is to visually inspect your vehicle\u2019s paint and feel for any roughness or contaminants. If the paint feels smooth and clean, there is probably no need to use a clay bar at that time. However, if the paint feels rough or there is a noticeable build-up of contaminants, it may be time to give your vehicle a clay bar treatment.\u00a0\n\nHow to use a clay bar\n\nUsing a clay bar is a simple but effective way to remove the stuff that gets stuck to your car\u2019s paint, glass, bumpers, grille, and even the rims. Here\u2019s how to use a clay bar:\u00a0\n\n1. Wash and dry your car\n\nBefore you begin, make sure your car is clean and dry. A clay bar will not effectively remove contaminants from a dirty surface.\n\n2. Divide the car into sections\n\nDivide your car into sections, such as the hood, roof, trunk, and each door. This will help you keep track of which areas you have already clayed.\n\n3. Knead the clay bar\n\nBefore you start using the clay bar, knead it in your hands to soften it and make it more pliable.\n\n4. Mist the surface with lubricant\n\nSpray a light mist of clay lubricant onto the surface of the car. This will help the clay bar glide over the paint and prevent it from sticking or scratching the surface.\n\n5. Glide the clay bar over the surface\n\nHold the clay bar in one hand and gently glide it over the surface of the car in a back and forth motion. Be sure to apply moderate pressure, but not so much that you risk scratching the paint.\n\n6. Wipe off the residue\n\nAfter you have finished claying a section, wipe off any residue with a clean, dry microfiber towel.\n\n7. Repeat the process\n\nRepeat the process on the other sections of the car until the entire surface has been clayed.\n\n8. Wash and wax the car\n\nOnce you have finished using the clay bar, wash and wax the car to protect the paint and give it a shiny finish.\n\nUsing a clay bar can help to restore the smoothness and shine to your car\u2019s paint, and is an important step in maintaining the overall appearance of your vehicle.\u00a0\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "What Is a Clay Bar and What Can It Do For Your Car?",
        "content": "What Are Clay Bars?\n\nClay bars are a type of detailing tool that is used to remove contaminants from the surface of a vehicle\u2019s paint, such as tree sap, rail dust, industrial fallout, brake dust, and overspray. They are made of a soft, pliable material that is typically molded into a rectangular or oval shape and can be easily molded by hand. Clay bars are used in conjunction with a lubricant, such as a detail spray or quick detailer, which helps to reduce friction and prevent scratching as the clay bar is worked over the surface of the paint.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat is claybar for cars made of? Clay bars are typically made of a synthetic polymer material, such as polyethylene, polyurethane, or a combination of both. The specific type of polymer used can vary depending on the manufacturer, but the general properties and function of the clay bar remain the same. Like modeling clay and Play-Doh, detailer\u2019s clay bars don\u2019t contain any natural clay.\u00a0\n\nHow Do Clay Bars Work?\n\nOne of the key features of a clay bar is its ability to pick up and remove contaminants from the surface of a vehicle\u2019s paint without scratching or damaging the finish. The polymer material in the clay bar is soft and gentle on the paint and is able to lift and remove impurities without causing any damage to the surface. It has a slightly sticky quality that allows it to grab onto the contaminants and lift them off the surface.\u00a0\nWhen used properly, clay bars can help to restore a smooth, shiny finish to a vehicle\u2019s paint and improve the overall appearance of the car.\u00a0\n\nShould You Use a Clay Bar for Your Vehicle?\n\nUsing a clay bar can help to remove contaminants from the surface of the paint that regular washing may not be able to remove. These contaminants can dull the appearance of the paint and make it feel rough to the touch.\u00a0\nIf your vehicle\u2019s paint feels rough or has visible contaminants on the surface, using a clay bar can help to improve the overall appearance and feel of the paint. The clay bar will pick up and remove these contaminants, leaving the surface feeling smooth and looking clean.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that using a clay bar should only be done after the vehicle has been thoroughly washed and dried. The clay bar will not be effective at removing contaminants if the surface is still covered in dirt and grime, and attempting to use it in this condition could potentially cause scratches or damage to the paint.\u00a0\nAlso, if you have any damage to the surface you\u2019re cleaning such as flaking paint, peeling clearcoat, or rust, the clay bar could further damage it. And since particles stick to the clay bar, it might be unusable anymore and need to be thrown away.\u00a0\nIn general, using a clay bar can be a useful tool for maintaining the appearance and value of a vehicle, and is an important step in the detailing process for any DIYer or professional detailer. However, it\u2019s always a good idea to test a small, inconspicuous area of the paint first to ensure that the clay bar does not cause any damage.",

When used properly, a clay bar can help to restore the smooth, glossy finish of a vehicle\u2019s paint and improve its overall appearance.\u00a0\n\nWhat to Consider When Buying a Clay Bar\n\nNot all clay bar kits are exactly the same, and doing a bit of research will help you choose the right one for your project.

You\u2019ll find fine, medium, and heavy clay bars, and they perform the way they sound. Fine clay bars are ideal for minor touchups while medium is a good all-purpose choice. Heavy is best for a particularly bad finish with lots of contaminant on it.\u00a0\nSize of the clay bar. Clay bars come in various sizes, from small bars that are suitable for spot cleaning to large bars that can be used to clay an entire vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\nBrand. There are many different brands of clay bars available, each with its own unique features and benefits. We\u2019ll show you five choices from three of the top brands.\u00a0\nPrice. Clay bars range in price from a few dollars and up, but a DIYer won\u2019t need a massive chunk of clay. Consider your budget and the level of performance you are looking for when choosing a clay bar.\u00a0\nLubricant: Clay bars typically require a lubricant to be used in conjunction with them to help remove contaminants from the surface of the paint. Some clay bars come with a lubricant included, while others do not. Consider whether you will need to purchase a lubricant separately or if it is included with the clay bar.\u00a0\n\nBest Clay Bar Kits\n\nWhile not an exhaustive list, these are five of the best clay bar kit options that you can find. They\u2019re all competitively priced and are effective in the hands of a DIYer and a professional detailer alike.\u00a0\n\nMothers California Gold Clay Bar Detail Kit\n\nTo pull your car\u2019s luster out from under the bug guts, sap, and road tar without breaking the bank, the Mothers California Gold Clay Bar Detail Kit is a great choice. It comes with two pieces of synthetic clay that you can use for small touchups or go over the full vehicle in one go. The kit includes 16 ounces of detailing spray as well as a microfiber cloth to wipe up after you\u2019ve tackled the job.\n\nChemical Guys Complete Clay System Kit\n\nFrom one of the most trusted names in detail supplies, you can get a kit to clay bar cars from start to finish.

        "content": "What you\u2019ll need\n\nBefore you clean up your floor mats, there are some supplies you\u2019ll have to get together. You\u2019ll likely have some of these items, but you may have to acquire some of the cleaners before you start.\u00a0\n\nA powerful vacuum \u2013 the stronger the better for a deep clean\nBristle brush\nSpray carpet cleaner (carpet mat)\nGarden hose (rubber mat)\nDegreasing all-purpose cleaner (rubber mat)\nMicrofiber cloth (rubber mat)\n\nHow to Clean a Cloth Car Mat\nWhen you know the proper steps, and you have the right tools, cleaning carpet floor mats is quick and easy. Follow along through each of these simple steps and you\u2019ll have like-new-looking mats before you know it.\u00a0\n\n1. Remove and Shake\n\nCarefully pull out each of the carpet floor mats and shake them off to remove any loose dirt or debris. By shaking the mats outside your vehicle you can remove most of the grime quickly.\u00a0\nBe careful to unclip your mats if they are secured in place.\u00a0\n\n2. Spray and Wait\n\nApply a fast-drying carpet cleaner directly to the mat from a distance of approximately 12 inches. The best carpet spray to act as a car mat cleaner foams up and dries fast. \n\n3. Scrub\n\nWhen the cleaner is fully dry you can begin scrubbing the mat using a stiff-bristled brush. Work the cleaner into the mat and loosen all the embedded dirt up using the bristles and a circular motion. \n\n4. Vacuum Clean\n\nFinish cleaning your floor mats by removing any dirt, the carpet cleaner, and loose debris using a powerful vacuum cleaner. Thoroughly vacuum all surfaces until you have clean floor mats.\u00a0\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how to clean car floor mats the above steps make achieving clean carpet mats simple and fast. You\u2019ll have to use a slightly different procedure for rubber mats though. Learn the process below.\u00a0\n\nHow to Clean a Rubber Car Mat\n\nRubber car mats are more durable than carpet mats and often easier to clean. There are more steps involved in cleaning a rubber mat, but you\u2019ll likely get a rubber mat clean sooner.\u00a0\n\n1. Remove and shake\n\nBegin by carefully lifting each rubber mat up and out of your vehicle. Try to avoid spilling the dirt and loose debris off the mat while inside your vehicle. When the mats are removed shake them off to get rid of any loose grime before you begin the real cleaning. \n\n2. Rinse Mat\n\nNext, quickly wash your mat down using a spray nozzle on a garden hose. A quick rinse will get rid of mud and dirt. You don\u2019t have to spend too much time on this step because you\u2019ll scrub off any grime that\u2019s trapped on the mat. \n\n3. Spray with Cleaner\n\nDilute a degreasing spray to approximately 3 parts water to one part cleaner to keep it from being too soapy. Thoroughly spray the first mat you wish to clean until it\u2019s coated with your diluted cleaner. The degreaser will help cut away any grease and buildup that\u2019s on your rubber car mat. \n\n4. Scrub Thoroughly\n\nBegin rubbing the mat using your stiff bristled brush to work the cleaner into the mat on every surface. Take your time and really scrub the mat to loosen any contaminants off your floor mat. This is the most time-consuming part of cleaning your mat so be thorough here.\u00a0\n\n5. Rinse and Dry\n\nFinish up cleaning your floor mat by rinsing off the soap and grime until it looks completely clean. Touch up any locations that are still dirty using your bristle brush and rinse it clean. Dry your mat using microfiber cloths and it should look as good as new.\nWhile these cleaning steps were designed for a rubber floor mat the same steps will work well on plastic mats and liners too.\n\nNow that you know how to clean car mats you can maintain the interior of your vehicle more effectively. Take the time to clean off the seats and the flooring in your car while cleaning the mats and you\u2019ll extend the lifespan of your car interior.\u00a0\n\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.\n\nFAQ",

        "title": "How to Clean Your Car with Foam Cleaner\u00a0",
        "content": "How to Clean Your Car with Foam Cleaner\n\n1. Getting Started\u202f \n\nBefore using the foam car wash soap, you should do a couple of things. Being the enthusiast you probably are, you won\u2019t just wash the exterior of the car, but you\u2019ll probably work on the interior as well.\u202f\u00a0\n\nThe first thing you should do is create a proper environment for washing your car thoroughly. You can do it on your driveway, however, to get the best possible results, and help yourself along the way, you\u2019ll need shade. It would be best if you have natural shade, but if you don\u2019t, it would be a good idea to create some for this purpose.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to have enough space to walk around the car and clean it thoroughly. Keep in mind that you\u2019ll be using a lot of water and chemicals, so if you have sensitive plants around the driveway, it won\u2019t be one of the best ideas to do a detailed car wash there.\u202f\u00a0\n\n2. What Products You\u2019ll Need\u00a0\n\nBefore starting anything, you should have all the tools, equipment, and products ready for use. Aside from buckets, sponges, drying towels, and other foam cleaner equipment such as a foam cannon, there are a couple of products you\u2019ll also need.\n\n3. Spray Foam\u00a0\n\nThe first, and most important product for making car cleaning foam is the foam car wash soap. Under no circumstances should you use regular dish soap because it will easily remove the wax from your car\u2019s paint.\u00a0\n\nThe spray foam is added to the foam cannon and is applied evenly to the car. For best results, the foam should do its work for a couple of minutes before using the mitt on the car.\u00a0\n\n4. Scrub\u00a0\n\nThe foam cleaner will agitate the dirt and debris from your car, but before you rinse it, you should use a soft sponge, and a variety of brushes to detach the dirt from the car. Regular sponges will leave scratch marks on your car, so when it comes to the bodywork, it\u2019s best to use a soft microfiber wash mitt.\u202f\u00a0\n\nWhen it comes to wheels and tires, you\u2019ll need a series of harder brushes, due to their frequent exposure to heat, dirt, brake dust, water, and other pollutants. Depending on how often you wash your car, giving a little special attention to the wheels and tires might do the trick, but to get the best results possible, it\u2019s recommended to use chemicals made for cleaning alloy rims and tires. These are much more aggressive than regular foam car wash soap and could harm the paint if not used properly.\u00a0\n\n5. Rinse\n\nMany consider rinsing one of the last steps to washing a car, but rinsing the car with water before applying car cleaning foam can be very beneficial. This is because water from a pressure washer will remove a large portion of dirt and debris from the car, allowing the foam cleaner to focus on problematic areas.\u202f\u00a0\n\nAny pressure washer can be used for rinsing. Once you\u2019ve let the car cleaning foam sit for a few minutes, and after you\u2019ve used the soft microfiber mitt to remove any remaining dirt and debris from the car, start rinsing it from top to bottom. This means removing the foam from the roof, windows, hood, trunk, and lastly, the sides and wheels. This way, you won\u2019t use as much water, and you won\u2019t be spraying contaminants from one part of the car to another.\u202f\u00a0\n\n6. Wax\n\nWax is applied as the last step of washing a car. This product comes in various shapes and sizes, and they pretty much do the same thing, no matter which forms you choose. There are several manufacturers of high-quality wax, which are all available at AutoZone. Most of these products come with a manual, so before applying the wax to your car, make sure you read and understand the proper way of applying it.\u00a0\n\nBuy Foam Spray and Hose attachment at AutoZone, where you\u2019ll find everything you need to repair, maintain, and even detail your car.

        "title": "How to Power Wax Your Car",
        "content": "Why Should You Wax Your Car?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat are the benefits of handling a wax yourself? There are a lot of perks to taking on this task: \u00a0\nSave a few bucks \u2013 Getting your car professionally power-waxed can be pricey. The cost can add up even more, depending on the amount of labor. You can bring down that bill and only pay for the supplies you need by handling this yourself.\u00a0\u00a0\nProtect and reduce exposure \u2013 The right car wax can add a thin layer of protection over your car\u2019s paint, preventing minor scratches and dents. Additionally, wax can slow down oxidation, which can cause your paint to chip over time.\u00a0\u00a0\nIncrease your car\u2019s resale value \u2013 A car with faded coloring and chipped paint can significantly drag down a car\u2019s value. Resellers pay attention to the aesthetic of a vehicle, and it may factor into how they price the car. Ultimately, power waxing can help you hold onto a higher car value.\u00a0\u00a0\nMaintain your vehicle\u2019s look \u2013 Overall, a power waxer can help you keep the original look of your car and seal the paint. The wax makes your car looks shiny, which adds to its attractiveness.\u00a0\u00a0\nIf DIYing maintenance on your car is something you enjoy, power-waxing your car can bring many benefits to your vehicle\u2019s look and your wallet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat is a Power Waxer?\u00a0\n\nWagan Euro Waxer\n\nPower waxers are handheld machines that typically have a long handle with a circular surface at one end where you can install a foam pad.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou would apply wax to the pad, which then rotates to apply the wax solution adequately.\u00a0\nPower waxers can come in two types: dual-action, which rotates and oscillates the pad, and rotary, which only rotates. Dual-action power waxers typically provide a smoother finish, while rotary may offer a faster waxing experience.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow to Wax Your Car Using a Power Waxer\u00a0\n\nPower waxing is a great car maintenance practice to DIY, but it\u2019s still a task you must be cautious about to avoid damaging your vehicle. Here are a few mistakes you need to watch out for.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Don\u2019ts of Power Waxing\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot going easy on the wax \u2013 You want to avoid applying too much wax. Overusing the wax brings about diminishing returns, as more wax won\u2019t make your car shinier. Instead, it will create more work for you as you\u2019ll have to buff off more of the extra wax with the power waxer.\u00a0\u00a0Not waxing in the right location \u2013 When power waxing, you want to pick a shady place. If you power wax under direct sunlight, the sun can quickly dry it, making it even hard to buff off the wax.\u00a0\u00a0Having dirty equipment \u2013\u00a0 From the microfiber cloth to the wax sponge applicator, you want to ensure everything is clean. The materials could have old and dry wax on them, damaging your car if they\u2019re used.\u00a0\u00a0Not having the right equipment \u2013 You may be tempted to use a regular cloth for polishing, but it\u2019s best always to use a microfiber cloth. Not only does it not leave residue behind, but it\u2019s one of the most effective tools for applying a solution to your car because of the material.\u00a0\u00a0Bypassing the wax\u2019s directions \u2013 First, you want to make sure you get the right wax product for your specific car. Then, you always want to look at the directions before applying the wax to avoid any issues.\u00a0\u00a0Applying wax to a wet car \u2013 One of the most critical principles of washing and waxing is that if you\u2019ve just finished washing your car, wait for it to dry in its entirety. Moisture will prevent the wax from sticking to your car. \u00a0\u00a0\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the don\u2019ts, let\u2019s look at the steps to correctly power wax your car. \u00a0\n\nHow to Power Wax Your Car \n\n1. Get the right products\n\nBefore you get started, make sure you have the right materials:\u00a0\n\nFoam car wax buffer applicator\u00a0\u00a0\nLiquid car wax or sealant (consider ceramic wax if you want a longer-lasting wax).\u00a0\u00a0\nPower waxer\u00a0\nMicrofiber towel \u00a0\u00a0\n\n2. Wash off dirt and debris\n\nMake sure you always wash your car to get rid of dirt and debris before getting started on the waxing process. Dirt, dust, and debris left on your car during the waxing process can scratch it. Find a sealant and wax-safe car shampoo, and use it to sufficiently wash off the surface to prepare your car for waxing. \n\n3. Prepare the power waxer \n\nAttach the foam wax buffer applicator \u2014 which is a foam pad that\u2019s made for buffing \u2014 to the power waxer. It should be new and soft but still durable enough to handle the task of waxing. \n\n4. Apply the wax to the buffer\n\nSqueeze a few lines of liquid wax onto the applicator. Make sure not to apply too much, as doing so will increase the work you must do to buff the remaining wax. \n\n5. Spread the wax before turning the waxer on\n\nPower waxers are robust tools and can make the waxing experience messy if you don\u2019t use the proper precautions. A great way to avoid spilling wax is using the foam pad to gently spread the solution over the car before turning it on.\n\n6. Turn on the power waxer\n\nOnce you spread the wax all over, turn on the power waxer to mid-speed. This will help you spread the wax evenly and avoid losing control of the buffer as you work. Also, always turn off your power waxer before lifting it off the vehicle to prevent spillage.\n\n7. Finish the job with a microfiber cloth\n\nYou can switch out the foam applicator for a microfiber cloth to finish buffing the wax and set up that smooth and shiny finish. Use broad strokes instead of circular motions as the latter can leave marks. \n\nDepending on how much of a finish you want for your car, it may be good to also consider polishing in addition to waxing.

        "title": "Car Detailing Cost: Better to DIY?",
        "content": "What\u2019s considered a car detailing?\n\nFor a basis to work from, let\u2019s establish what auto detailing we\u2019re talking about. For our purposes, it\u2019s the process of keeping or restoring your vehicle to its best cosmetic condition from start to finish. Car detailing includes:\n\nWashing and drying the exterior\nCleaning the wheels and tires\nWaxing or polishing the paint\nDe-cluttering and vacuuming the interior\nCleaning the interior vinyl and plastic trim\nShampooing the seats and carpets\n\nFor some detailing shops, the process also includes scratch removal but that\u2019s not always included.\n\nProfessional Detailing\n\nThe Average Cost of Going to a Car Detailing Shop\n\nWhere you live determines how much you\u2019ll have to pay for a professional detailing job, just like the same mechanical repair can cost different amounts in different states. For example, the average car detailing in the US is approximately $160. But what does it cost to detail a car in Hawaii? It could range from under $100 to $270 or more. The same job in Oregon could run between $186 and $296.\nThe price also varies depending on the type of vehicle you drive. A compact car has less area to clean, so it stands to reason it costs the lower end of the scale. Large SUVs and trucks, especially very dirty ones, could be more expensive than the high end of the price range since it takes more time to clean them.\n\nThe Pros of a Professional Detailing\n\nWhy choose to go to a professional to detail your car? Honestly, the biggest reason is the convenience of not doing it yourself. It can take a pro between three and eight hours to detail one vehicle from start to finish, and specialty vehicles or extra-large models could be even longer. If you don\u2019t have much free time in your schedule, it makes sense to hand the job off to a pro. Other reasons to get professional detailing include:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to invest in detailing equipment.\nThey have higher-grade equipment than you do at home.\nYou don\u2019t need to have a place to clean your car.\nThe weather outside doesn\u2019t matter.\nThey often do a better job, plain and simple.\n\nThe Cons of a Professional Detailing\n\nLike anything, bringing your car to a detailing shop doesn\u2019t always work out the way you hoped. There can be downsides to professional detailing such as:\n\nIt obviously costs quite a lot.\nThe job might not be done to your higher standard.\nThere may be additional costs if you need a very dirty vehicle cleaned.\n\nDIY Detailing\n\nWhat You Will Need With DIY Car Detailing\n\nWhat you need for DIY Car Detailing\nYou\u2019ll need to purchase car wash soap, a wash mitt and brush, tire cleaner, tire shine, a professional-grade vacuum cleaner, a power polisher with compounds, a chamois or microfiber cloths, and interior detailing sprays. If you want to shampoo your upholstery, you\u2019ll also need to buy an extractor. Initial costs might seem pricy, but the trade-off is you\u2019ll have the supplies to detail vehicles for a while.\nHow much does a car detail cost if you do it yourself? Long-term, the price is probably about $30 to $50 per detailing, assuming you take care of your equipment.\n\nThe Pros of DIY Car Detailing\n\nIf you take pride in being a capable DIYer or you just can\u2019t justify the cost for professional vehicle cleaning, then you can tackle the job yourself. There are perks to detailing your own vehicle such as:\n\nYou can do it whenever you want without making an appointment.\nYou don\u2019t need to find alternate transportation while it\u2019s at the shop.\nFeel free to clean it to your own standard\u2014no more, no less.\nYou aren\u2019t paying for someone else\u2019s labor or materials.\nIf it doesn\u2019t turn out perfectly, you can redo it with no additional costs or complaints to the manager.\nYou can reuse your detailing supplies time and time again.\n\nAnd when you finish, the sense of a job well done is elating.\n\nThe Cons of DIY Car Detailing\n\nAnd once you have all the supplies, consider the time it takes to do the job. A professional will most likely be able to complete the job much quicker than if you handled it yourself. You will want to dedicate a good amount of your day to be able to fully detail your car inside and out.\nWhat\u2019s more, car detailing is almost an art form. It takes try after try to do a good job, so there could be many instances where you aren\u2019t exactly thrilled with how it turns out.\n\nKnow What is Right for You\n\nHow much does a car detailing cost when you do it yourself versus a professional? it\u2019s likely around one-third of the price to do it on your own. If you\u2019re not sure that detailing is a process you enjoy or have time to stick with, maybe it\u2019s best to choose the services of a professional a few times a year. In the long run, DIY detailing can save you boatloads of money, but you have to be committed to it.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Car Polish vs. Car Wax: When to Use Each",
        "content": "What does a Polish Do?\n\nWhen your car comes from the factory, its paint is in pristine condition, and it will be very smooth. The clear coat won\u2019t have any sun damage, and the paint will never have been abused by sand, gravel, and the debris that punishes it daily in the real world.\nAll the abuses that your paint, and especially the clearcoat, face every day change its surface from ultra-smooth to pitted and irregular. Light that shines on the old, weathered clearcoat paint reflects differently, and this is why paint gets that faded look.\nWhen you polish your car, you are actually sanding down the irregularities at a very fine level, smoothing out the pits and scratches, and removing adhered contaminants, leaving you a smooth finish.\nIf your car has a flat or matte paint finish, you want to be careful because polishing this type of finish could damage the look of it.\n\nWhy Should You Wax Your Car Paint?\n\nAny time you polish or sand a surface, you remove some material from the original surface. In the case of your car, the polishing removes some clearcoat, and over time you could be left with only the basecoat, which will wear faster.\nWaxing the vehicle adds back material, which helps to protect the paint on your car from the sun and other debris. There are a few different types of car wax, which we\u2019ll look into later on.\n\nWhat Do I Do First?\n\nIf you need to deal with heavily damaged clearcoat areas, you\u2019ll want to start with a rubbing compound, which is basically a very aggressive polish. Use the compound to address any problem areas before polishing the entire car with a standard polish.\nOnce you\u2019ve polished and wiped the entire vehicle, the final step in the process is to wax the car to protect the paint. Keep in mind, if the clearcoat has been damaged to the point of flaking or peeling, not much is going to be accomplished and the car will need to be completely re-painted.\n\nHow to Polish Your Car\n\nThe first step in working with paint on your car is always a thorough wash and dry. Any small debris or even dust that is left on the vehicle will be polished into the clearcoat during the procedure.\nWhen washing, you want to start at the top of the vehicle and work your way to the bottom because most dirt and grime sticks to the lower parts of the car. Use lots of soapy water on your soft washing brush or cloth and rinse the washcloth often to remove any dirt that has come off your car. Microfiber products are very effective at removing dirt but they need to be clean to avoid scratching your paint. Rinse the car thoroughly and then dry it with a clean microfiber cloth or chamois. If you want to get the car perfectly clean, use a clay bar for the final touch up.\nNow that your car is clean, take your microfiber polish applicator and apply a couple dime-sized spots of polish to the center of the applicator. Dab the applicator on a section of paint and use a circular motion to work the polish into the clearcoat, in an area of about 16\u201d by 16\u201d. Repeat the process over the body of the vehicle, pausing to use a clean microfiber cloth to wipe off the polish residue every so often. You don\u2019t need to let the polish \u201cset\u201d, so as soon as you\u2019ve done an area, like the hood of the car, for instance, you can wipe it off. Don\u2019t polish your car in direct sunlight because the sun will bake the polish and it will be very difficult to wipe off.\n\nHow to Wax your Car\n\nThere are a few different common types of car wax, so we\u2019ll give a short explanation for each. Paste wax comes in small round tubs so that you can put your applicator right into the tub to add some wax, before applying it to the vehicle.\n\nLiquid wax comes in squirt bottles and is about the consistency of mustard, so you can apply small amounts on to your applicator or buffing pad.\nBoth paste and liquid waxes are applied in a similar fashion to your car polish, using an applicator, working in small sections. The main difference is that you will want to leave the wax on the vehicle to set for a period of time before buffing it out with a microfiber cloth. You\u2019ll know when it is ready to be buffed because if you swipe your finger along the paint, it will leave a clear line, without hazing or greasy streaking.\nSpray waxes come in spray bottles and are the quickest method of waxing your car. If you are getting ready for the Sunday night cruise, a bottle of spray wax is a quick way to bring out the natural shine of the vehicle without spending a ton of time in the garage. Just spray the wax on a clean car and wipe it off with a microfiber cloth, being careful not to reuse dirty areas of the cloth. There will be a light film left after wiping, so give a quick buff with another microfiber cloth and you\u2019ll be good to go. The only downside to spray waxes is that they will tend to wash off much faster than the other two types, so you have to reapply them more often. The upside is that you are protecting the paint of your car, and it looks great.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs automotive enthusiasts, there\u2019s nothing better than seeing cars lined up and gleaming in the sunlight. Take the time to wash, polish and wax your car, and stop into your local AutoZone for all the buffing and waxing supplies you\u2019ll need to get the job done.",

        "title": "How To Properly Wax Your Car by hand",
        "content": "What\u2019s the Difference Between Wax?\n\nThe primary ingredient in quality car wax products is carnauba, synthetic polymer, or ceramic wax, but carnauba wax is likely the most\u00a0well known\u00a0as\u00a0it\u00a0as\u00a0been used for decades. This product comes from Brazilian palm leaves and is a durable, natural product. Most waxes also include synthetic polymers and other waxes to vary the glossy finish, ease of application, and longevity of the product. \nCompare brands and styles of wax to be sure you have the best option for your driving habits and vehicle.\u00a0Wax and finish products vary and can be slightly confusing, so here\u2019s some of the most popular and what they\u00a0perform:\nRubbing Compound: The most aggressive compound and used for heavily scratched,\u00a0swirled\u00a0or hazy vehicles. When wet sanding a freshly painted vehicle or\u00a0doing\u00a0major corrections in the finish, rubbing compound is the first step after fine wet sanding. Recommended to be applied by a machine, and then followed up with polishing compound.Polishing Compound: A finer cut than rubbing compound, polishing compounds can be used after clay bar if the vehicle has corrections in the finish like swirl marks and very light scratches or haze to polish out. Again, best recommended to be used with a machine.Cleaner Wax: Cleaner wax is a bit of a tweener between polishing compound and a wax. While it doesn\u2019t cut into the finish as much, if can be used to remove very fine swirls\u00a0and also\u00a0provides a wax protectant layer too.Traditional Wax: Used either as a paste, spray, or liquid, traditional wax is applied, left to dry, and wiped off.\u00a0Wax paste is the hardest type of automotive wax. This provides a long-lasting finish preferred by many auto\u00a0enthusiasts, but\u00a0is also more difficult and time-consuming to apply. Spray wax is the easiest to\u00a0apply, but\u00a0may not offer the same long-lasting results of paste. Finally, liquid wax is a middle-ground option that doesn\u2019t require as much effort as paste but still offers more longevity than spray.Ceramic Coatings: Ceramic spray coatings are all the rage right now as multiple offerings have hit the market by storm. These coatings are a synthetic-based sealer. A spray-on, wipe off sealer than can go directly over a nice glossy shine, and help to protect the finish even more. With ceramic coatings, dirt and mud can be hosed off without barely applying soap, and water is shed from the vehicle quickly, eliminating spots. To use, spray on and wipe off with a dry microfiber or buffing towel.\u00a0The coating must then cure, which takes 8-12 hours, so do not wash or re-wet after application.\n\nHow to Wax a Car by hand\n\n1. Gather Supplies and Find the Ideal Workspace\n\nAs described in our 6-steps for washing your car article, you should always pick a shaded area to properly wash your car. For waxing and finishing, you\u2019ll want to move your car into the garage or covered space that is completely clear of the sun. It\u2019s best not to wax your car in direct sun. Here are the basic materials you need to wax your vehicle:\n\nCar wash\nBug and tar remover\nDrying towels\nClay bar kit\nApplicator pads\nPolishing compound or scratch repair products (optional)\nYour preferred spray, paste, or liquid wax\nOrbital buffer (optional but preferred)\nBuffing pads\nBuffing and wax removal towels\n\n2. Wash the Vehicle\n\nBecause wax is used to seal the surface of your vehicle, it\u2019s important to thoroughly clean its surface before you start the process. Use an car wash and microfiber cloth or other preferred cleaning steps to remove dirt, oils, and insect parts from the surface of your car body. Look at your car\u2019s paint closely to ensure that deeply clean to remove any sticky substances like tar and pitch. Bug and tar remover will clean these surfaces and get them ready for wax.\n\n3. Check for Imperfections \u2013 Clay Bar\n\nHaving a paint surface completely clear of contaminants is vitally important. Once your car is clean a dry, gently slide your fingers across one of the body panels. You will feel small, tiny bumps in the paint that feel almost like sand grains. If you feel these, a clay bar treatment is the next course of action. The clay bar works by spraying on the clay \u201clubricant\u201d and using a wiping motion with the clay to scrub the paint. This removes any contaminants, as you then wipe the remaining lubricant off with a microfiber towel. The result is a perfectly smooth finish, ready to apply wax or polish.\n\n4. Wax or Polish by Hand\n\nOnce your car is washed and clay-bar\u2019d (if you choose to do so) you can proceed to polishing or waxing. Many folks are confused about the difference between polishing and waxing, as many products appear to do the same thing. A polish has actual cutting compound in it and is made to remove swirl marks, fine scratches and haze by cutting into and creating a new sheen surface. Most polishes do not have wax in them, and are strictly a compound for shining. While you can use a polishing compound by hand, it is extremely difficult and is recommended to always use a machine, such as the Griot\u2019s buffer/polisher to do so.\nAs far as wax goes, applying by hand has been done for decades and is still a popular method.  Apply wax with a clean applicator pad one area at a time and don\u2019t attempt to apply wax to your entire vehicle at one time. Once you\u2019ve sprayed or applied wax to a single area and waited for the wax to dry to a haze, rub it with a damp microfiber or cotton buffing cloth to remove and shine.\nTurn the cloth or pad over and buff out the remaining product with the other side. Be sure to use circular motions and to work slowly to ensure every area is covered and excess wax is removed as you work. Once you\u2019re finished, you can expect car wax to last between three and six months, depending on the weather and your driving habits.\n\n5. Or Wax with a Buffer\n\nWhile waxing by hand is a process that\u2019s been around for decades, using a dual-action polisher like the Griot\u2019s unit is beginning to become commonplace because of it\u2019s ability to speed the job up, and ultimately put the wax and compounds to better use. While polishing or applying wax by hand, even at a quick pace may possibly achieve 240RPM (approx. 4 revolutions per second of the applicator pad), using a machine is achieving 2000-6400RPM. This is especially important when applying polishing compound or cleaner waxes, which need these revolutions to cut into the finish and properly polish.\nBe sure to read the owner\u2019s manual on your particular buffer before use. Depending on the size of your vehicle and the contours of its body, you may need to be extra precise to cover every area of its surface. Once you\u2019ve chosen a buffer, understand that there are different types of buffing pads, designed to \u201ccut\u201d into the finish (for polishing) or application pads, for waxing. There are also buffing pads specifically for removing wax.\nApply the wax to the orbital pad before you turn the buffer on, as these tools can be used on both the buffing stage and applying stage. Once wax is thoroughly spread over a single area of your vehicle, turn on the machine and allow it to gently glide and buff the wax. This will save you time and energy on the waxing process.\n\nYou also might want to consider getting a power waxer for your car to get that professional wax feel and look.

        "title": "How to Clean Your Car's Interior",
        "content": "How to Clean Your Car\u2019s Interior\n\n1. Remove All Items\n\nThe first thing that you are going to want to do when you begin to\u202fclean out the interior of your car\u202fis to ensure that you clear out all of your belongings. Some folks practically live in their vehicles, which means that trash can accumulate. If you are driving around with children in tow, the situation can get messy fast.\nMake sure that you remove everything from the interior of the car that is not attached. This includes trash, gym bags, children\u2019s toys, magazines, or anything else that is in there. You may find it advantageous to have a trash receptacle and a recycling bin near the car while you are doing this. Also, remove the front and rear floor mats. Now is a great time to hose them down. Even if they are carpeted floor mats, then can be soaped, scrubbed, and hosed off. Hang them over an outdoor chair or somewhere in the sun for several hours to dry out.\n\n2. Vacuum\n\nOnce you are done removing everything, you can begin the vacuum process. Regardless of whether you start in the back floors or front, move the front seats all the way forward, or backward to gain the most space to vacuum. Don\u2019t forget the trunk or cargo area. Many cars present challenging nooks and crevices, especially along the edge of the door that are tough to fit a vacuum or Shop Vac extension into. \nOne tip is to make your own custom hose tool by attaching a length of smaller heater hose (like 5/8 size) or vinyl hose and taping it around a vacuum extension piece. Then, whenever you need to tackle these tough crevices, install your custom hose, and have the ability to clean tight spots.  \n\n3. Interior Detailing\n\nNow it\u2019s time to start your car\u2019s interior cleaning. Using some basic\u202fcleaning wipes or glass cleaner, you can start wiping down the dash, instrument cluster, and center console. \nMost center console units that have cup holders will have a way to remove either the holders, or the entire section, which can then be cleaned in the sink with soap and water. This is best to remove spilled drink residue and grime. \nFor small cracks, vents, and tough to reach spots, you can use detailing brushes, an old toothbrush, or cotton swabs to clean. \nOnce your plastic dash and interior pieces are clean, these can be treated with interior shine, such as Meguiar\u2019s Supreme Shine interior detailer. Use a microfiber towel or applicator pad to apply the detailer.\nAfter you are done with cleaning the plastic pieces of the interior, you can move onto the interior windows. A\u202fmicrofiber towel\u202for good old paper towel will work well here. Some folks even swear on old newspaper (yes, it\u2019s a thing!) You can go ahead and spray the interior windows with window cleaner and use the towel to get a streak-free shine. If you have tinted windows, make sure that you follow any cleaning instructions that came with them, so you do not accidentally ruin the finish. Don\u2019t forget the inside of the back window, which is often neglected.\nLast, you can address your upholstery. If your seats are cloth, they can be cleaned with either a foam cleaner or a small portable carpet cleaner. If you happen to have leather seats rather than upholstered ones, you can clean them with treatments used specifically for cleaning and conditioning leather, like Lexol products. Make sure to test your preferred cleanser out on a small area to ensure that it does not affect the coloring or feel of the leather. \n\nOnce you are done with all of this, make sure that you leave time for your car to air out. It is likely that you will have used multiple cleaners inside of the car, and while you probably commonly use these cleaners in your house, the small interior of your car will make the smells more overwhelming. Leaving your car doors open for a bit so that the smells can dissipate will make your car a more pleasant place to be.\u00a0\nFinally, you may wish to finish with an\u202fair freshener\u202fif you like to use these in your vehicle.\u00a0\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere is no one best way to clean a car\u2019s interior, but the overall process can be very simple. A few hours of your time on a lazy weekday can help make your car a much more pleasant place to be for the rest of the work week.\nDon\u2019t forget: the more often you clean your car, the less time it takes! Consider how much time you spend inside your vehicle, and it\u2019s easy to see how that time can go a long way to more pleasant times down the road.",

You can purchase a headlight restoration kit, which should have everything you need to perform the job, or you can buy the elements of those kits separately. Buying the kit removes most of the guesswork when purchasing supplies. However, purchasing a kit might also be wasteful if you already have some of the elements. Therefore, if you decide to buy everything separately, you will need at least the following six things on your shopping list.\n\nDifferent grits of wet/dry sandpaper (1000, 2000 and 3000)\nBlue painters tape\nPolishing compound\nPaste wax\nUV sealant\nMicrofiber towels\n\nHow to Clean Headlights with Toothpaste\n\nLet\u2019s say you need your headlights clean, but you don\u2019t want to buy a cleaning kit, or you are unable to. If so, you can do a pretty good job with a toothbrush, some toothpase, a spray bottle full of water, and a cloth. Ideally, the toothpaste should feature baking soda for maximum efficiency. Here\u2019s how to restore headlights with toothpaste:\n\nRub toothpaste into the headlight lens with the toothbrush (You can use a rotary buffer for a deeper clean)\nKeep rubbing to scrub the lens housing clean\nSpray warm water onto the headlight and wipe away the toothpaste using the cloth\n\nIt might seem simple, but if you follow those steps, you should have cleaner headlights.

        "title": "How to Get Tar, Sap, Bugs, and Other Caked-on Dirt Off Your Car's Paint",
        "content": "Clean it Up\u00a0When You See It\n\nProbably the most salient advice for big messes is to keep on top of your car\u2019s washing. If you notice any sort of an issue, it\u2019s better to take care of it right away as opposed to letting it harden on your vehicle. Additionally, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so regularly washing your car should become part of your weekly routine. With a little bit of maintenance, you may find that major clean-up jobs can be avoided.\nThe best way to tackle spot cleans between\u00a0regular car washings\u00a0is to obtain a microfiber towel, some mild car wash, and water. With all of this in hand, you can simply go after problem spots as soon as you notice them. Again, the longer you wait, the more elbow grease it requires to remove in the long run.\n\nGiving Asphalt, Tar, and Pitch\u00a0the Boot\n\nSome of the most frustrating substances to try and remove from your car are sticky ones. Asphalt, tar, bugs, and tree pitch can give you a real headache. Often, the soap and water treatment is not enough to really remove these annoyances from your vehicle.\nThankfully, there are specific products that can help you restore your vehicle to its original luster. In order to remove stubborn sticky debris, you first want to drive your vehicle into the shade or somewhere cool, and let your vehicle cool down. If your vehicle is hot when you apply the product, it either hardens or evaporates too quickly.\nWhile traditional Bar and Tar remover are often the best items for this job, using the \u201cthousands of uses\u201d traditional WD-40 or other penetrating oil, or even Goo-Gone will also remove plenty of super-stubborn contaminants from the paint. For paint that\u2019s been contaminated with microscopic things you can feel on a freshly washed car, using a Clay Bar is by far the industry standard for getting a nice, smooth, contaminant free finish that is ready for waxing. It\u2019s highly recommended that you Clay Bar your car any time before you are applying wax.\n\nHow to Remove Sticky Substances from Your Car\n\n1. Inspect Your Vehicle\n\nAfter your car has cooled off and is completely dry, you can then inspect the vehicle for any sticky messes. In terms of asphalt, you\u2019ll find it most often on your mud flaps, rocker panels, doors, and hub caps. Bugs and tree pitch can be plastered across your headlights, hood, and grille. Of course, any of these annoyances can be found anywhere, but these are the most common locations.\n\n2. Spray the Mess\n\nWhen you find a sticky mess, reach for a bug-and-tar remover first. You can spray the remover on the areas that have the mess, and let it sit for at least five minutes. A good practice when using an automated car-wash is to spray the front of the vehicle and mirrors with bug and tar remover about 5 minutes before entering. This will help the car wash break up the bugs and mess that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have come off.\n\n3. Use a Towel to Remove Debris\n\nOnce the product has set for an appropriate amount of time, you can then use a microfiber towel to remove the mess by rubbing it in a circular motion. This should remove the debris. In the event that you were trying to remove mess from a difficult location, like your car\u2019s grille, you can spray the product into the towel and work it along the surface that way.\nIf you are dealing with a stubborn sticky mess, you can also try using a dabbing maneuver to loosen it. You want to avoid abrasive materials like scrubbing pads or steel wool, as these can damage the finish of your vehicle.\n\n4. Wash Your Car\n\nOnce the mess is removed, you can then go ahead and wash your car like normal to return it to its original state.\n\nHow to Remove Highway Paint / Other Paint\n\nOne of the more frustrating risks of driving through construction zones is discovering highway paint splattered all across the bottom of your vehicle. To this end, if you have to drive through a construction zone, make sure that you keep a sharp eye on your rocker panels, doors, wheel wells, and tires. It\u2019s easy to miss splatters of highway paint, and the quicker you are able to remove this menace from your car, the better.\nHowever, if you do discover splatters of any kind of paint that are dried on your vehicle, there are many steps you can take to remove it. First, you should always try going through a traditional car wash or putting some elbow grease in on your own driveway with mild car soap and water.\nIf this fails to remove the paint, go ahead and reach for your bug-and-tar remover and use the same steps outlined previously to remove the paint. You may also want to add more of the remover to your microfiber towel, and try and buff out the paint in a circular motion. It is very likely that this is going to take a good amount of time to get all the paint off, so be patient.\nIf this fails to work, usually the best option for removing paint, but requires extreme caution, is Lacquer Thinner. Most modern paint jobs are a basecoat/clearcoat finish, and once hardened, is resistant to solvent like Lacquer Thinner in small doses. The best method is to test your finish in an inconspicuous area to be sure the Lacquer Thinner won\u2019t damage it. In most cases, it will not, and to apply, simply splash a little Lacquer Thinner onto a microfiber or polishing towel and gently rub the area that has the paint you wish to remove. You will notice the Lacquer Thinner will dissolve the paint quickly. It will also strip any wax off of the finish, so after removal, you will need to re-wax / polish the area that once had paint on it, but usually this is the quickest and easiest way to remove paint that otherwise will not come off.\nIf this still fails to work, you may wish to reach for a polishing compound. Polishing compounds are slightly abrasive and can help you remove paint without damaging the surface of your car.\nTo use a polishing compound, apply to either an application pad by hand, or use a mechanical buffer / compound over the area. Follow up with wax.\nWith these car wash tips and tricks in mind, you can ensure that your summer drives remain carefree and, ultimately, clean.",

        "title": "Using Ceramic Spray Wax to Protect Your Vehicle",
        "content": "Why use Ceramic Wax?\n\n1. What is Ceramic Wax?\n\nCeramic wax is applied by hand or sprayed onto the outside of your vehicle. The wax is actually a chemical polymer that bonds with the clear coat to create a protective layer that sits between your vehicle\u2019s paint and the elements. \n\nCeramic coatings are costly, labor-intensive installations that provide excellent, long-lasting protection. Professional ceramic coatings can cost as much as $2000 due to the amount of prep work and skill involved, but are among the most effective ways of protecting your vehicle\u2019s paint.\nDo-it-yourself ceramic products provide better and longer lasting protection than traditional carnauba waxes, but are installed in a similar way, and can be purchased at similar price points. The applications function similarly to traditional carnauba waxes, but provide superior and longer-lasting protection at an affordable price.\nAutoZone carries ceramic wax in a few spray wax options, linked at the top of this article. \n\n2. How It Is Used\n\nCeramic spray wax makes getting long-lasting protection fairly simple, but you\u2019ll still want to read the directions. Some Ceramic Spray Waxes can be applied Wet, some can only be applied Dry, and some work under both conditions. \nMost importantly, make sure the paint surface is clean and smooth to the touch prior to application. The wax is a protectant, so any contaminants or dirt left on the paint before waxing will stay, stuck to the paint, under the wax. \nMother\u2019s CMX Ceramic Spray Wax is intended to be applied dry. Just spray on the surface and buff with a clean, dry microfiber cloth. The Meguiar\u2019s Hybrid Ceramic can be applied similarly, but also is designed to be applied with water.\nFollow the manufactures recommendations. Most recommend doing  a panel at a time to ensure consistency. Be sure you have clean dry microfiber cloths to apply the Ceramic Wax evenly and also a clean dry microfiber to remove and buff off any residual.\n\n3. How is it Different from Conventional Wax?\n\nCeramic spray wax is a coating that does not wash away or wear off as quickly as traditional Carnauba wax, meaning it does not need to be reapplied as often. You can, however, reapply and \u201dSTACK\u201d the coating creating an even stronger barrier against the elements. It creates a layer of protection over your vehicle and is more chemical resistant than standard wax.\nCeramic coatings will initially be more expensive. However, a ceramic spray wax will offer more UV protection, be chemical resistant, and will last longer. Conventional waxes and sealants will typically protect your vehicle for about a week or two, but ceramic spray waxes will protect for months at a time.\nConventional waxes are made of a substance referred to as carnauba wax, which helps protect vehicles from weather elements such as harsh sun exposure. This wax is applied to the vehicle in a circular formation, allowed to dry, and then buffed out until the surface is clean and shiny. \nCeramic spray waxes offer better protection and does not use carnuaba wax. However, it is much easier to use compared to conventional waxes.",

        "content": "How to Maintain Your Car\u2019s Paint and Finish\n\n1. Wash\n\nFrequent washing is critical to remove surface dirt, salt, and contaminants that can damage the paint and leave scratches. This is even more important in the winter months, especially in the snow-belt. Be sure to use an automotive wash and never household cleaners or dish soap \u2013 they can strip away wax and leave your paint exposed to UV. Work from the top down to ensure that you don\u2019t re-contaminate the area you just washed. \nRemember, the process of washing is to lift dirt and contaminants off and away from the paint surface, not rub and grind those contaminants in farther. This is one of the reasons why many automated car washes tend to leave scratches. \nWash your car in a low-light area where the sun cannot quickly dry your water and soap on the car. Completely flood the vehicle first with water and rinse off any major dirt or salt with water pressure. Avoid re-dipping your brush or sponge into dirty, contaminated water. \n\n2. Clean\n\nCleaning removes particles that have adhered to the paint, such as tree sap, tar, and even brake dust. Start by determining the level of contaminants. Anything sap, grease, bug or tar based should be removed with Bug and Tar remover and re-washed in that area. You will feel contaminants on the paint by gently running your hand across a perfectly clean panel. It should be completely smooth, and usually it is not. \nYou want your vehicle to have a smooth finish, free of any contaminants before you proceed on. One of the most popular and easy-to-use, low-risk products to accomplish this is a Clay Bar. Clay Bars work to lift these contaminants off of the paint, and prepare the surface for Polish. \n\n3. Polish\n\nHave a wet cloth ready to remove polish from rubber or glass surfaces, or splatter before it hardens and dries, where it becomes more difficult to remove. Be sure to do your polishing and waxing work completely in the shade, or in the garage.\n\n4. Protect\n\nWaxing protects the finish and adds gloss. Wax also works as a UV protectant in the summer. Frequent exposure to the elements means more frequent waxing to maintain that protection. Use a high-quality car wax and apply in overlapping circles before removing. You can also use your same Griot\u2019s or equivalent buffer to apply wax, just be sure you are using a clean application pad, not re-using your polishing pad without cleaning it. \n\n5. Maintain\n\nAfter applying wax, you can maintain your finish with any number of ceramic coatings that are hitting the market, and these work excellent to add additional protection and water repelling. \n\nMore Car Wash Supplies \n\nOrbital Polisher\n\nBuy Now \n\nFoaming Sprayer\n\nBuy Now \n\nClay Bars\n\nBuy Now \n\nTurtle Wax Ceramic Coating\n\nBuy Now \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to wash your car, you can count on AutoZone as the one stop shop for everything you need to keep your car looking great.

        "title": "Choosing the Best Car Wash for Your Car",
        "content": "Things to look for in a car wash\n\n1. Plenty of suds\n\nUnderstanding how soap works is important. The suds of soap not only work to clean the surface through friction of the brush/sponge, but they also work to suspend those particles in the brush and sponge so they don\u2019t continue to get ground into the paint\u2019s surface. The more suds, the more suspension of contaminants you get.\nLook for a car wash soap that has rich, foaming agents and one that stays foamed. Whether you are applying the wash via sponge/brush or through a foam cannon/gun, you want something that maintains the suds all the way through rinse. Most vehicle finishes will work well with a car wash that has blended conditioners and detergents to help suspend and lift the dirt off your vehicles paint without being harsh to the finish. Detergents break down the grease and grime coating your car, safely encapsulating them in suds to not scratch your car paint.\nNote: Make sure to pre-rinse your car to remove the heavier dirt before getting your car covered in suds. Loose dirt will trap itself in the sponge and can scratch the paint if not rinsed off first.\n\n2. Balanced pH\n\nAn important selling point to finding the right car wash is finding a wash with a balanced pH to cleanse your car without being harsh to the finish. Higher pH concentrated soaps work fine for removing bird droppings or tree sap but are often too harsh in pH for the paint\u2019s wax and finishes, leaving it looking dull. \n\n3. Waterless Wash\n\nWaterless car wash soap is great for quick clean up in-between washes or to use on cars with minimal dirt and grime. The wipes are meant to be used to spot clean, or lightly dirtied cars. If you live in dry areas or states with laws that limit the use of water used for car washes or you want to conserve water, consider using a waterless spray car wash or wipes. Keep in mind that if your car has seen fairly muddy days, this is not the kind of wash you should be using.\n\n4. Consider a Foam Cannon",

        "content": "How to Wash Your Car Tutorial Video\n\nHow to wash your car the right way.\n\n6 ways to get a better wash\n\n1. Wash on a regular schedule\n\nSome detailers recommend every week, but every other week is probably fine as long as you immediately address obvious issues like dead bugs, bird droppings, or major dirt buildup.\n\n2. Set up in a good area\n\nSet up to wash the car in a shady area, direct sunlight can cause spotting. We recommend using a dedicated car-wash soap and a microfiber wash sponge. A car wash soap is detergent free. Detergents will cause your wax to have a spider-web finish and create a haze. Wash sponge are great because they hold a lot of soapy water, grab lots of dirt and grime, and won\u2019t leave micro-scratches on your paint. It\u2019s also a good idea to use two buckets. One for clean soapy water, and one with rinsing water to remove dirt from the sponge. If this is not an option, just spray the sponge off between rinsing. It\u2019s never good to wash the whole car and then rinse. The sun and heat can cause soap to dry, making you re-wash.\n\n3. Work from the wheels up\n\nIt might sound counter-intuitive, but you want to start low. Start with the wheels and lower body to clean the dirtiest parts of the car first. Lots of people like to start rubbing down the hood, but the wheels are always the dirtiest part of your car, and you want to get that dirt off before moving on to the paint. Washing the wheels first will also save you time from drying paint twice. Always wait until the wheels have cooled before cleaning them. \n\n4. Take the time to dry the vehicle\n\nYou don\u2019t want soap and dirt residue to hold on the paint after you\u2019ve put in all this hard work. And you\u2019ll need a clean, dry surface if you\u2019re also waxing. It\u2019s a good idea to use a terrycloth or microfiber towel, clean and lint free, for the best drying.\n\n5. Wax in sections, in the shade\n\nYou don\u2019t want the wax to dry before you\u2019ve had a chance to buff, so pick a dedicated section, apply the wax, and buff before moving on. Spray waxes offer an easy way to wax your vehicle in sections. Simply spray while the vehicle is wet, and then use a microfiber cloth to rub the wax onto the surface. If you notice spider-webbing and haze you\u2019ll need to use a cleaner wax. You could also use a nonabrasive cleaning compound to remove the old wax before using a polish. Removing old wax and applying new wax should be done at least once a year.\n\n6. Finish with the glass\n\nIt\u2019s a good practice to clean your interior with appropriate materials as well, shampoo for cloth seats and dedicated leather cleaner for leather seats, but save your glass and windows for last to make sure you catch and residual cleaner from the other applications.\n\nShop All Car Wash and Detailing Products",

        "content": "Tips for Cleaning Your Windshield and Glass\n\n1. Be Aware of When You Clean the Windshield\n\nThere are certain conditions you want to avoid when cleaning your windshield. Obviously you\u2019re not going to have much success if you attempt to clean the outside of the windshield while it\u2019s raining or snowing outside. However, cleaning a hot windshield is also going to create additional problems. \nDirect sunlight or a hot windshield will cause the windshield washer fluid or cleaner to evaporate when it\u2019s applied. This not only creates streaking issues and reduces the impact of the cleaner, but it can also create harmful vapors that can be damaging if inhaled. Always clean a windshield in a garage or in shade to avoid these problems.\n\n2. Choose the Right Supplies\n\nThe first item to choose is the windshield auto glass cleaner. A general rule of thumb is to avoid using products that contains ammonia, alcohol or any ingredients that produce toxic fumes. Glass cleaners come in aerosol cans and spray bottles, and several great auto glass cleaners come in a wipe.\nYou will also need is the right towels or rags to clean the windshield. Back in the \u201cold days\u201d using a newspaper was the best item for effectively cleaning a windshield, but times and technology have changed quite a bit. The best products to use now are microfiber towels.\nWhen you buy microfiber towels, make sure you have (4) to use. Two for the inside glass and two for the outside glass. The first towel will be used to remove liquid residue from the auto glass cleaner, the second is used to remove excessive \u2018fog\u2019 or residual. This step will be addressed below.\n\n3. Start on the Outside\n\nStart by cleaning the outside of the windshield. Spray or apply auto glass cleaner on a small section. If you\u2019re using a spray, follow the directions to determine how long to leave the product on the windshield. Once the product has soaked in (this doesn\u2019t take long, just a second or two), use the first microfiber towel to remove the liquid. \nWhen all liquid has been removed, used the second, clean microfiber towel to \u201cbuff\u201d the windshield. This is best done in a circular motion, to remove the haze that builds-up. Continue these steps until the entire windshield is clean.\n\n4. Continue with the Inside\n\nFor the inside of the windshield, the steps are identical. It might be more difficult to reach certain areas, so clean the inside in three-sections if needed. The Invisible Glass triangle brush is great for helping to clean hard-to-reach corners of the inside of the windshield.\n\nOrder online or visit one of our AutoZone locations to find the best auto glass cleaning supplies that will keep your windshield clean, and improve your visibility as you drive.",

        "title": "How to Remove Rust from a Car",
        "content": "What Damages are Caused by Rust?\n\nWhile rusting may seem like little more than a surface issue that affects your vehicle\u2019s appearance, it can actually be a serious problem that you should not ignore. Vehicle panels can rust from the outside in, or from the inside out, and once the metal is perforated, the only proper repair is a complete panel replacement or section replacement with new metal. If left unremedied, rust damage may eventually make its way to the frame of your car, creating serious structural damage that you may not be able to repair. If you want to keep using your car for as long as possible, then rust is something you can\u2019t ignore.\nLearn how to prevent rust from building up on your car\u2019s exterior.\n\nCan Rust be Removed?\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good to know that rust is not an issue you want to leave unaddressed, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how to get rid of rust on your vehicle. While almost any vehicle will eventually begin to rust as it ages, there are still ways to mitigate rusting in order to keep it from permanently damaging your car.\nRust restoration involves using abrasives and/or chemical rust removers to get rid of existing rust formation and stop it from spreading. In most cases, you will need to cover the surrounding, undamaged area with tape that won\u2019t damage your vehicle. Once you have used a rust removing product to get rid of the existing rust you will need to paint back over the restored area with primer. To keep rust from returning you should plan on putting on at least a few coats of primer. If the rusted area is too damaged, it may not be worth trying to restore and simply opt for panel replacement.\n\nHow to Remove Rust from Your Car\n\n1. Safety first\n\nThis project is going to require you to use safety googles. Always make sure your car is parked on a flat, level service. Do not wear loose fitting clothing or loose jewelry. Make sure you are working in a well-ventilated area. \n\n2. Tape it off\n\nIsolate the section you\u2019ll be working on, the same as if you were painting the vehicle. You\u2019ll want to make sure the non-rusted sections are protected. The rust job will put a lot of rust and paint particles in the air, so keep those off the healthy paint. Make sure to use real masking paper rather than newspaper.\n\n3. Remove paint and primer\n\nStart low and work your way up. We advise using a dual action sander, or a held-held grinder with a flap-disc for better control, starting with 60-80 grit. You\u2019ll want to sand through both the paint and the primer, and you may be able to take some rust off this way if it\u2019s loose on the metal. Understand that when sanding bubbles in the paint, many times the rust under it will have perforated the metal, and will show up as small pin holes in the metal. During this first step, most of the surface rust will also be removed.  \nShop our large selection of sanders and accessories for this step.\n\n4. Remove rust pits\n\nWhen repairing rusted sections of metal, it\u2019s important to understand that primer and paint cannot stick to rust, or at least, not for very long. It\u2019s important that all the metal you are working with is completely clean and free from rust. For this you\u2019ll need to use a\u202fgrinder or drill with a wire wheel, or a chemical compound such as \u201cmetal rescue,\u201d and make sure to wear eye protection and a dust mask. Use the wire wheel carefully to remove the rust that lives in the pits or below the surface area of the metal. Keep in mind that everything needs to be clean! If you use a chemical type rust remover, apply with a paint brush to concentrate your approach. Read the directions on the chemical bottle to determine the amount of time the chemical needs to work before re-cleaning the area. Chemical-based rust removers are good for removing rust and any microscopic remains.\n\n5. Prime the surface\n\nWhether you plan on simply priming the area for the time being, or actually refinishing a panel or section with the proper paint finish, the success of your job starts with a properly primed surface. Use an etching primer or primer that is suited for direct-metal contact. From here, you can choose to finish the panel with either body filler or surfacing primer, and then paint. Keep in mind that using body filler directly on bare metal that has not been sealed properly is not a good practice, and the repair will crack and fail over time.\n\nHow Difficult is the Rust Removal Process?\n\nSince the extent of rusting will be different in every case, it can be hard to gauge the exact amount of time you will need to spend to get rid of it. Sometimes it can be a simple task that only takes an hour or so, while in other cases serious repairs may need to take place over the course of a couple of days. \nMany times, the true extent of the damage will not be immediately revealed. For instance, an area that has 2 or 3 small rust bubbles, once stripped and cleaned may reveal several large rust holes in the panel, that needs to be replaced. You should try and pick a time to work on maintenance when the weather is good and allows you to work in an open area outside where you will get plenty of ventilation. You don\u2019t want to get caught in the rain in the middle of repairs, so it\u2019s worth tuning in to your local weather before getting started. Always assume worst case on the area you are working on, and have a plan for complete panel cut out / replacement if the repair turns out worse than expected.\nWhile not the easiest DIY car repair, rust removal is something that you can do on your own. If you\u2019ve never done similar maintenance before then you may want to find additional information and tutorials to help give you the know-how to get the job done right the first time.\n\nRestoring a Rusty Vehicle\n\nOnce you notice rust damage on your vehicle you shouldn\u2019t wait to get it fixed. It may not be the easiest repair process, but if you feel comfortable enough to try you should find that removing rust on your own is worth the work you put in. Doing the job yourself can be a great way to ensure that it is done with as much care as possible, and even with the products you will need to buy it can be a much cheaper option than hiring the work out.\nIf you don\u2019t feel comfortable making the repairs yourself, don\u2019t sweat it.

        "title": "What to Do When Wiper Fluid Freezes",
        "content": "Understanding the Problem\n\nWiper fluid typically consists of water and special additives designed to clean your windshield effectively. However, during cold winter months, these additives may not be enough to keep the fluid from freezing. Here\u2019s why:\n\nLow temperatures \u2013 When the mercury drops lower or sooner than expected, the water in your wiper fluid mixture can freeze.\nInadequate antifreeze \u2013 Some wiper fluids have a low concentration of antifreeze, making them more susceptible to freezing in extreme cold.\nDilution \u2013 Mixing your wiper fluid with water to save money may dilute its antifreeze properties, increasing the likelihood of freezing.\n\nKnowing the signs of frozen wiper fluid is crucial for staying safe on the road during winter. Look out for these indicators:\n\nClogged nozzles \u2013 If the wiper fluid nozzles on your vehicle are not spraying properly or at all, it might be due to frozen fluid.\nStreaks on windshield \u2013 When wiper fluid freezes as it leaves the nozzles, it can leave streaks of frozen liquid on the windshield, impairing your vision.\nUnusual Sounds \u2013 You might hear unusual sounds when trying to activate your wiper fluid, indicating that it\u2019s frozen. It\u2019s the washer fluid pump unable to circulate the fluid.\n\nPreventing Wiper Fluid Freezing\n\nAnother way to avoid frozen wiper fluid is to park your vehicle in a sheltered or heated area whenever possible. A garage or covered parking space can help maintain a slightly higher temperature, preventing your wiper fluid from freezing. If you don\u2019t have access to covered parking, consider using a windshield cover to protect your windshield and wiper fluid from the cold.\n\nThawing Frozen Wiper Fluid\n\nIf you find yourself with frozen wiper fluid, there are solutions to thaw it and get back on the road safely.\n\nWarm water \u2013 One quick fix is to pour warm but not boiling water into your windshield washer fluid reservoir, then activate the washers. As the edges of the washer fluid thaw, it can sometimes allow the pump to move fluid through the lines again.\n\nHeat the reservoir with a hair dryer \u2013 Gently warm the reservoir with a hair dryer, making sure to keep it moving to prevent the plastic from melting or deforming. Often, you can use the wiper fluid if you can melt the edges, then top it up with cold weather washer fluid.\n\nWarm Your Vehicle \u2013 Turn on your car\u2019s engine and let it warm up, which can also help thaw frozen wiper fluid in the reservoir, especially if it\u2019s only barely frozen.\n\nWhile these methods can be effective, it\u2019s essential to be cautious and avoid causing damage: Do not use excessive heat. Boiling water and prolonged heat from a hair dryer can damage the reservoir and other surrounding parts. Never pour hot water directly on the windshield either as it can cause a rapid expansion that cracks the glass.\n\nWiper Fluid Heater Systems\n\nFor those who want a more permanent solution to frozen wiper fluid, wiper fluid heater systems are a great option. Wiper fluid heaters are small heating elements installed in the wiper fluid reservoir. They work to keep the fluid from freezing by warming it before it\u2019s sprayed onto the windshield. These systems are specifically designed for cold weather regions and offer a reliable solution to the frozen wiper fluid problem.\nInstalling a wiper fluid heater can be complex but the investment can be well worth it. It keeps the washer fluid in its liquid state, plus being warm, it can help melt snow and ice from the windshield, keeping your view clear.\n\nWinter Wiper Blade Maintenance\n\nTo complement your efforts in preventing frozen wiper fluid, maintaining your winter wiper blades is key. Winter wiper blades are specially designed to perform well in cold weather. They have a rubber boot covering the frame, preventing the buildup of ice and snow, and ensuring proper contact with the windshield.\nTo keep your winter wiper blades in top condition, regularly clean the blades to remove ice and snow buildup. Check for any visible damage or wear and tear, and replace wiper blades if they\u2019re not providing a clear and streak-free wipe.\nFrozen wiper fluid can be a nuisance during the winter months, but with the right preventative measures and solutions, you can ensure clear visibility and safe driving. And whether you need winter wiper fluid or any other fluids or parts for your vehicle, AutoZone has it for you from trusted brands like Duralast.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Signs You Need a New Windshield Wiper Blade",
        "content": "How Long Will Windshield Wipers Last?\nDeterioration will happen to any wiper blade as soon as it\u2019s put into use. How long will they last once you begin to put them into action? It depends on a few factors:\n\nHow much they\u2019re used. Every pass over the windshield \u2013 or rear glass, if it\u2019s a rear wiper blade \u2013 will contribute to microscopic wear on the blade.\nExposure to UV rays. The rubber edge deteriorates from the extreme heat and exposure to the sun, causing the blade to dry out, harden, and crack.\nThe type of material they\u2019re made of. Natural and synthetic rubbers tend to break down or wear quicker than silicone wiper blades.\nThe environment you\u2019re in. Freezing rain, ice, and snow buildup can cause them to get damaged prematurely.\n\nIn most temperate areas that don\u2019t experience extreme temperature swings or large precipitation dumps, a set of wipers will last around a year. But when you introduce extreme cold or heat, or a vast majority of your days are sunny, that timeframe can shrink to just six months sometimes.\u00a0\nAs well, anytime your wiper blades aren\u2019t clearing the glass properly, you should change them \u2013 even if you\u2019ve had a new set installed not long ago.\nSigns You Need New Windshield Wipers\nHow do you know when to install new wipers? You might only experience one of the symptoms, but you should take care of it right away when you do. Signs you need new wiper blades include:\n\nStreaking \u2013 If your wipers leave streaks or smears on the windshield, it\u2019s a sign that the rubber has become worn or damaged and is no longer making proper contact with the glass.\nSkipping \u2013 Wipers that skip or chatter across the windshield can be a sign of uneven pressure or a damaged wiper blade.\nSqueaking \u2013 If you hear a squeaking or other unusual noise while using your wipers, it could mean that the rubber is worn or hardened, causing friction against the glass.\nSplit or cracked rubber \u2013 Inspect the wiper blades for any visible splits, cracks, or tears in the rubber, which can cause poor performance and streaking.\nBent or damaged frame \u2013 Check the wiper arm and blade frame for any signs of bending or damage. A bent frame will prevent the wiper from maintaining even pressure on the windshield, leading to ineffective cleaning.\nLoss of Flexibility \u2013 If the rubber on the wiper blades feels hard or inflexible, it\u2019s likely time for a replacement. Over time, the rubber can harden due to exposure to sunlight primarily, but heat and cold can also damage them.\nIneffective Cleaning \u2013 If your wipers are no longer effectively clearing water, snow, or debris from your windshield, it\u2019s a sign they need to be replaced.\n\nWays to Maintain Your Windshield Wiper Blades\nOnce you\u2019ve installed a new set of wiper blades on your vehicle, you\u2019ll want to make them last as long as possible \u2013 at least achieving the 12-month expected lifespan that most offer. One of the most helpful methods is to install the correct type in the first place. If you\u2019re in an area where you get plenty of precipitation, choose frameless wiper blades or hybrid blades that have fewer or no pivot points to seize up. As well, their profile uses the wind to help put pressure against the glass for better cleaning.\u00a0\nDuring every fuel fill or car wash, it\u2019s a great idea to wipe the edge of each wiper blade with a soft cloth or paper towel wetted with washer fluid. This gets any abrasive material or contaminant off the blade.\u00a0\nAnd if you drive in dusty or dirty conditions, consider blasting the dirt off of your car in a car wash before turning on the wipers to prevent them from wearing prematurely. If you\u2019re in a cold climate, avoid turning on the wipers if there\u2019s a chance they\u2019re frozen to the windshield or the glass is iced over.\n\nFind Your Local AutoZone\n\nFrequently Asked Questions",

        "title": "Spring car care checklist",
        "content": "Check your windshield wiper blades\u00a0\n\nCheck your windsheild wipers\nWiper blades can freeze to the windshield in a snowstorm, and ice and snow on the glass can act as an abrasive on the rubber edge. Check along the flexible rubber edge of each wiper blade for nicks and cuts. If you see damage, or if your wipers leave streaks behind after a pass, replace them both.\n\nInspect and top up the fluids\u00a0\n\nInspect and top fluids\nFluids can have moisture intrude or form from cycles between hot and cold temperatures. Contamination can occur, and oils can break down and lose viscosity. Check the color and level of each fluid including:\n\nEngine oil\nTransmission fluid\nEngine coolant\nBrake fluid\nPower steering fluid\nOn 4WD and AWD vehicles, differential and transfer case fluids\n\nIf they\u2019re in poor condition, flush and fill them with the appropriate fluids. Also, top up the windshield washer fluid.\n\nCheck the air filters\n\nCheck the air filters\nAlthough dust storms and bugs aren\u2019t the norm in the winter, the air still carries particles that will get caught in the air filters. Inspect the engine air filter as well as the cabin air filter to ensure they aren\u2019t coated in debris. Check that light passes through the pleats, indicating that air can still make its way through efficiently too. If the filters are dirty, smelly, or you can\u2019t see light through them, replace them. It\u2019s usually necessary every year as part of your vehicle maintenance schedule.\n\nTest the battery\n\nTest the Battery\n\nCheck the brakes\n\nCheck the brakes\nAs summer approaches, your brakes will need to be in good condition to bring your vehicle to a halt, and higher temperatures can cause brake pads and rotors to wear a little faster too. Make sure you\u2019re starting the season out right and that your brake pads have at least 3/16ths of an inch remaining at each wheel for both the inboard and outboard pad. Brake rotors shouldn\u2019t be gouged, and they shouldn\u2019t have ridges or pockmarks of rust on either side. If they\u2019re not in great shape, change them out.\n\nInspect the tires\n\nInspect the tires\nYour all-season tires should have at least 4/32nds of an inch of tread depth remaining as you start the spring driving season, and there shouldn\u2019t be any uneven wear across the tread or feathering. Since air pressure changes with the temperature, adjust the air pressure in your tires.\n\nPerform a tire rotation\n\nIf your tire tread depths are uneven, it might be time for a tire rotation. There\u2019s some debate about where to put the best tires during a tire rotation for car maintenance, but the prevailing idea is to install the best tires on the front. That ensures you have the best traction for steering and stopping.\n\nCheck the suspension and alignment\n\nHave you heard any rattling or clunking over the winter? Does your steering feel loose or tight? Look for leaks at the shocks and struts, play in the sway bar links, suspension bushings, and ball joints, and look for cuts or leaks at the CV joints. Also, if your steering wheel is off center as you drive straight or your car pulls to the side when you\u2019re driving on the highway, a wheel alignment should be scheduled.\n\nDo a spring cleaning\n\nDo a spring cleaning\nSand, salt, moisture, and a host of other things will find their way onto your carpets, upholstery, paint, wheels, and glass during the winter. At the first sign of spring, it\u2019s a great time to wash away all the grime. A thorough spring cleaning requires only a handful of detailing supplies that you can use year after year. A good car wash, a deep vacuum, and a wipedown of all the plastic and glass will make your car look good as new and prevent corrosion while you\u2019re at it.\n\nPerform a tune-up (if required)\n\nIf it\u2019s been a while since your last tune-up, your Check Engine Light has come on, or your odometer has crossed a significant milestone like 50k, 100k, or 150k miles, it could be time for a more in-depth car maintenance process. Spark plugs, ignition cables, and fluid flushes may be due. It\u2019s best to follow the maintenance schedule provided by the manufacturer for major services.\nIf you complete the items on this spring car checklist, you\u2019ll help minimize the overall cost of repairs and prevent untimely issues from occurring.

        "title": "How to Replace a Windshield Wiper Motor\u00a0",
        "content": "What does a windshield wiper motor do?\u00a0\n\nA windshield wiper motor is a small electric motor that powers the windshield wipers on a car. The wipers are attached to the motor by two metal arms attached to a wiper transmission or linkage, and when the motor spins, the arms flap back and forth quickly, wiping away rain, snow, or dirt from the windshield.\u00a0\nThere are two main types of windshield wiper motors: those that use a gearbox to spin the wipers at different speeds, and those that use a DC (direct current) motor to spin the wipers at one speed. Most modern cars use DC motors, although some older models still use gearbox-powered motors.\u00a0\n\nWhat can go wrong with a windshield wiper motor\u00a0\n\nThe wiper motor is an electrical part, and a failure usually only appears in a few different ways:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe wipers stop moving altogether. If the motor quits completely, the wipers simply won\u2019t activate when you turn the switch on. The motor can fail with the wipers parked or while they\u2019re in motion, so they might be partially up if it goes.\u00a0\nThe wiper motor fuse blows often. A wiper motor that\u2019s failing could still operate at times, but with any load on it like snow or wiper friction against a dry windshield, the circuit could be drawing more power than normal. The fuse burns out to protect the circuit, but it indicates early failure.\u00a0\nThe wipers move slower than usual. The wiper motor can have extra resistance from dirt or debris clogging the moving parts, or the electrical components could be in suboptimal condition, causing slower speeds.\u00a0\nThey park in an incorrect position. The wipers are meant to part at the bottom of their sweep. If that\u2019s not happening, there\u2019s often a problem with the electrical side of the wiper motor.\u00a0\n\nCauses of failure range from simply a defective part to trying to operate the wipers with too much load on them. It\u2019s often seen in northern areas with an abundance of heavy snow, and the operator turns on the wipers without sweeping the bulk of the white stuff off first. Typically, wiper motors last more than 10 years, and often outlast the rest of the vehicle. But if it fails, there\u2019s no other long-lasting or safe correction than replacing the motor with a new one.\u00a0\n\nSteps to replace the windshield wiper motor\u00a0\n\nThe process of replacing a windshield wiper motor varies greatly between different makes and models. Generally, there are a few steps to take to remove the faulty part and install a new one.\u00a0\n\n1. Remove the wiper arms (if necessary)\n\nSome wiper arms need to be removed if the pivots are through the windshield cowl. If yours don\u2019t obstruct the cowl removal, then they might be able to stay on. To remove the wiper arms, remove the lock nut holding them in place. Then, use a wiper arm puller to separate the wiper from the splines on the pivot.\n\n2. Pull the cowl off\n\nIn many vehicles, the wiper motor is either in the engine bay or underneath the windshield cowl. If yours isn\u2019t under the cowl, it likely has to come off anyway to disconnect the wiper motor from the wiper linkage or transmission. It\u2019s normally just a handful of screws to remove, then lift it out of place.\n\n3. Disconnect the wiper motor\n\nThe wiper motor is attached with an electrical connector, a connection to the linkage, and three or more bolts keeping it in place. First, disconnect the harness from the wiper motor and tuck the pigtail out of the way to prevent it from getting pinched and damaged. Then, unbolt the wiper transmission from the motor. It could be just one bolt or nut in the middle, keeping it meshed with the gear on the motor. Finally, unbolt the wiper motor from its mount and remove it.\n\n4. Install the new motor\n\nTo install the new windshield wiper motor, begin by bolting it to the chassis and connecting the electrical harness. Before attaching the linkage, cycle the wipers once to ensure the motor stops at the bottom of its sweep. If you don\u2019t do this step, its likely not going to be an issue, but it\u2019s a safeguard from turning the wipers on for the first time and having the wiper arms move in the opposite direction and bend the arms, blades, and damage your windshield frame and hood.\nWith the motor \u2018parked\u2019, ensure the wiper arms are down in the parked position also and attach the wiper linkage. Then, install the cowl and fasten the wiper arms to the pivots. It\u2019s a great time to install new wiper blades too.\n\nWhat does a new windshield wiper motor cost?\u00a0\n\nInstalling a new windshield wiper motor will most often cost between $90 and $225 for the parts, although there can be more or less expensive options too. If you have a technician install it for you, expect to pay around an hour in labor charges. If you\u2019re a capable DIYer, it\u2019s a great opportunity to save a little money.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDo you need a more in-depth look into your vehicle to help you with your project?

        "title": "What is a Windshield Washer Reservoir?",
        "content": "What Plastic is a Washer Fluid Reservoir Made Of?\n\nA washer fluid reservoir is typically formed from polyethylene plastic. This flexible plastic is resistant to the effects of chemicals in the washer fluid it contains and needs to hold up to different washer fluid blends over time. The special washing fluid that\u2019s used to clean your windshield must contain antifreeze to hold up to subzero temperatures in cold climates. One of the main reasons a fluid reservoir cracks and fails is because the wrong fluid is used, and it freezes and expands to damage the bottle. Investing in a washer fluid that includes antifreeze is important, especially when driving in a climate where temperatures drop below freezing for part of the year.\u00a0\n\nHow Does the Fluid Reach Your Windshield?\n\nThe windshield fluid reservoir holds the specialized cleaning fluid for your windshield, but a pump sends that fluid through spray nozzles mounted facing your windshield. These nozzles send a stream of spray onto your windshield, allowing you to clean off dirt, ice, and other debris so you can maintain your vision while driving.\u00a0\n\nReplacing a Damaged Windshield Washer Reservoir\n\nReplace your winshield washer tank\nIf you notice your windshield washer reservoir is losing fluid rapidly, it likely has a leak somewhere in the housing. These leaks are caused by frozen fluid most of the time, and you\u2019ll need to fully replace the reservoir to repair your vehicle. Follow the steps below to successfully replace your reservoir.\u00a0\n\nObtain a compatible replacement reservoir\nRemove the battery, fender, and any other parts obstructing the reservoir mounting bolts\nUnscrew the fasteners holding your fluid reservoir in place\nRemove the old reservoir and install the replacement part using the stock fasteners\nInstall all the other components you removed from your vehicle\n\nIf you\u2019re careful to obtain a compatible washer fluid reservoir for your vehicle, it can be installed as a replacement in less than an hour with standard hand tools. Sometimes, though, the reservoir is tucked behind a bumper or in a wheel well where it takes much longer to change.\u00a0\nGaining access to the tank may require removing your battery, the battery tray, the fender, and other select components depending on your vehicle model. The installation process is essentially the reverse process of removal once you have full access to the mounting fasteners for the reservoir tank.\u00a0\n\nConsider Hiring a Professional\n\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable removing components under the hood of your vehicle, or you aren\u2019t experienced with automotive hand tools, it\u2019s best to hire a professional to replace your washer fluid reservoir.You seek one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job. An experienced mechanic can install the washer fluid reservoir into your vehicle for a fair hourly rate and you\u2019ll typically spend between $30 and $200 in parts, depending on what you drive.\u00a0\nConsider having your mechanic replace the windshield wipers while they are replacing the fluid washer reservoir to keep your windshield clear in different driving conditions. Most typical wiper blades last between six months and one year before they must be replaced, but this range depends on the weather conditions that you drive in.\u00a0\nThe windshield washer fluid reservoir on your vehicle is a vital part of your vehicle that helps you maintain clear vision as you drive. Always invest in high-quality washer fluid, and monitor the level in your reservoir to avoid the most common maintenance issues that will cause your reservoir to fail or malfunction. If your reservoir is still full of fluid but washing fluid isn\u2019t being sprayed onto your windshield you may also have to check the windshield washer pump on your vehicle to be sure that hasn\u2019t failed.\n\nFAQ",

        "title": "Should You Leave Your Windshield Wipers Up?",
        "content": "Is it safe to leave your winshield wipers up?\n\nWindshield wipers are pressed flat to the glass by springs within the wiper arm. These springs are stretched when you pull the wiper arm upwards away from the glass. This is okay for a short time, like when you are changing the wiper blades. However, leaving them in the upward position for a long time can permanently stretch the springs overtime. This is why it is not a good idea to leave your wiper blades up in preparation for cold precipitation. Once you stretch out that spring, the wiper arm can no longer provide the right amount of pressure, causing poor wipe quality. Also, when the wiper arm is in the up position, it is not stable and can easily slam down onto the windshield due to the force of the spring. This force can pull the wiper blade back to the windshield hard enough to crack the glass.\nSo what should you do? There are a couple options:\n\n1. Cover Your Blades\n\nIf you cover your wiper blades in bag, they won\u2019t freeze to the windshield. Plastic grocery bags work, or you could wrap them with plastic wrap or a small tarp. Whatever you use, make sure it is waterproof.\n\n2. Beat the Cold with Deicer\n\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about your wiper blades freezing to the windshield if you have deicer, which is designed to make quick work of ice. You can even get deicing wiper fluid, which can make getting frost off your windshield a breeze.",

        "title": "How Long Do Windshield Wipers Last?",
        "content": "Introduction to Wiper Blade Lifespan\n\nIt seems pretty handy to keep your windshield clear when you drive, but there are significant safety benefits to wiper blades.\n\nThey keep your view clear. First and foremost, wipers remove precipitation, dirt, bird droppings, bug guts, and other debris so you can see where you\u2019re going unobstructed.\nThey reduce eye fatigue. Spots on the windshield can draw your eye away from the road, and the fight between downroad visibility and spots on the glass can tire your eyes out.\nThey keep you safer. By removing obstruction in your view, you can more safely maneuver on the road.\n\nTheir simplistic design means that there isn\u2019t much that can go wrong with them, but wipers will eventually need to be replaced. The rubber blade edge that contacts the windshield, the frame, and the wiper arm connector can all be weak spots, and factors like regular use, overuse on a dry windshield, and environmental exposure can all take their toll.\n\nSigns Your Wiper Blades Need Replacement\n\nHow do you know when your wiper blades need to be changed? Primarily, you\u2019ll notice that they don\u2019t perform as well as they used to. What would once be cleared by a single swipe of the wipers might now take two or three passes to be removed, or it might require a stop at a fuel station to scrub the glass with a squeegee instead.\nCommon signs that wipers are due for a change include:\n\nSwaths of uncleared glass after the wiper goes over it.\nStreaks that always seem to be in the same place.\nSmearing instead of clearing.\nBits of rubber blade edge hanging loose.\nVisible cracks or chunks missing from the blade edge.\nChattering or screeching as the wipers pass over the glass.\n\nOn a visual check, you may notice that the wiper\u2019s hinges don\u2019t move well or the pivot attaching the blade to the wiper arm is tight. Or, there might be metal pieces coming loose from the sides of the wiper blade edge, threatening to scratch the glass.\n\nFactors Affecting Wiper Blade Longevity\n\nGenerally, wiper blades tend to last around 12 months in normal conditions. While it might be possible for them to last much longer under certain conditions \u2013 even three years or more \u2013 it\u2019s a good practice to replace them before they stop working well. And in some areas, that replacement interval could be closer to every six months.\nFor example, direct exposure to UV rays can cause the rubber edge to dry out and crack. Or, frequent drives in snowy and icy conditions can tear the blade edge, even if it is brand new. Other factors that reduce wiper lifespan include high heat and arid, desert-like weather.\nMatch your wipers with the conditions you drive in normally. Conventional wiper blades are a fine choice for most temperate climates, but there are better options if your drives take you outside of those normal situations. Consider getting a set of beam-style wipers that are hingeless and conform to the glass well, helping to prevent problems due to ice and corrosion. For winter driving, winter wipers can be the ideal solution to prevent hinges from getting jammed up with ice and snow.\n\nHow to Extend the Life of Your Wiper Blades\n\nWant your wiper blades to last longer? A little care goes a long way.\n\nWhenever you fuel up, wipe your windshield wiper blade edges with a soft cloth or paper towel wetted with washer fluid to remove crud that builds up.\nWash abrasive debris and larger messes from your glass with a squeegee first, avoiding tears on the edges.\nPark your car out of the sun to prevent UV rays from degrading them.\nDon\u2019t operate your wipers when the windshield is dry.\nAllow your icy windshield to thaw before moving the wiper blades in case they\u2019re frozen to the glass.\u202f\n\nSelecting the Right Replacement Wiper Blades\n\nAlso, be aware that for a majority of models, the driver\u2019s side and passenger side wiper blades are different lengths. The driver\u2019s side is typically longer, providing better visibility where it matters most.\nWiper blades come in various types and materials, each designed to address specific driving conditions. Silicone blades, for instance, offer durability and consistent performance, while hybrid blades combine the benefits of traditional rubber and beam-style blades. Understanding these options allows you to make an informed decision based on your driving habits and local climate.\nYou\u2019ll always find wiper blades for your car at AutoZone from popular brands like Duralast Gold. And whether you shop online or in-store, we\u2019ll help you get the right fit for your vehicle.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

        "title": "Why are My Windshield Wipers Not Working?",
        "content": "How Windshield Wipers Work\n\nThe windshield wiper system is made up of only a few components, and significant problems can occur when only one of these elements is damaged. The power to the system is regulated by a fuse that\u202fis wired directly to the wiper motor and the switch. When the switch is engaged, the motor rotates, and a network of linked arms, connected by several pivot points, converts this rotation into the back-and-forth motion of the wiper blades. When your wipers stop working, it is a good sign that one of these critical elements is damaged or broken.\n\nFive Reasons for Why Your Wipers May Not Be Working\n\nUnfortunately, your windshield wiper system is prone to problems, especially when you have owned a vehicle for several years. Because of the system\u2019s minimal design, it is somewhat\u202ffragile under the right set of circumstances. Therefore, it is beneficial to understand the most common problems as well as how to resolve them. When it comes to windshield wipers and their controls, there are five common reasons for problems to occur.\n\n1. Torn Blades\n\nThis is the most common issue occurs with the wiper blade itself. The rubber of the blade has a direct correlation to the effectiveness of the system. For example, when the blades are new and fully in contact with the surface of the windshield, they are effective at removing excess moisture. However, when the edges are worn, developing a series of small tears in the rubber, they are less effective because they cannot collect or divert moisture that occurs in the gaps of the blades. Therefore, if you notice that your wipers are streaking and not performing as expected, examine the blade for tears, and replace as needed.\n\n2. External Interference\n\nOne of the most common reasons for poor wiper performance is the presence of\u202fice or snow on the windshield. While windshield wipers are capable of removing light snow and ice, they are not designed to clear away heavy snowfall or ice frozen onto the windshield. If you decide to\u202fuse your wiper blades for this reason,\u202fthen you risk damaging the blades. Some wet snow can be so heavy for the blades that it\u202factually\u202fbends them. Also, if ice has been left to collect and stick to the windshield, then it can be too abrasive on the blades and cause minor tears in the rubber. Always clear your windows of piled snow and ice before turning on your wipers.\n\n3. Failed Motor\n\nIf you notice that your windshield wipers stop working altogether, then it is a good sign that something has happened to the motor. As an electrical component, the motor can short out, causing the wipers to fail. However, it is also possible that there is a loose or disconnected wire in the circuit. If this happens, inspect the connections and the motor as soon as possible and replace any necessary elements.\n\n4. Bad Fuse\n\nBefore the wiper motor goes bad, you will probably experience a blown wiper fuse, which is intentional. The fuse is designed to be the circuits weak spot, which protects the wiper motor. Essentially, if your vehicle\u2019s wiper motor is being overloaded, the fuse will blow to ensure the motor does not become damaged. Therefore, while you might\u202fbe tempted to simply replace the bad fuse, it is better to examine the connections to see if any obstructions could be affecting the wiper motor beforehand.\n\n5. Loose Pivot Joint\n\nLast, your windshield wiper issues could stem from a loose pivot joint. If you remember the mechanics of the windshield wiper system require pivot points to convert the rotational energy of the motor into the back-and-forth motion of the blades. If one of these pivot joints is loose, then it can affect the effectiveness of the blades. Therefore, you will need to check the pivot points and ensure that all nuts and connections are secure.\n\nProfessional\u00a0Inspection\n\nIf you have run through the above list and still cannot resolve your windshield wiper issues, then it might be time to call a professional. Thankfully, the process is pretty\u202fstraightforward, and in some instances, a mechanic might even come to you. They will do a thorough inspection of your entire system to ensure that all the components are in good working order. Through this process of elimination, they will be able to\u202fdiagnose your problem and hopefully resolve it.\nLearning how to fix windshield wipers is not that challenging, but the answer to your problem is not always as simple as replacing your car\u2019s wiper blades. If you are experiencing issues withz your windshield wipers, then head on over to your favorite auto parts store and ask a representative for some assistance. Your vehicle\u2019s windshield wiper system might not be that complicated, but it is integral to your safety.\nIf the job is too big for you, seek out one of our Preferred Shops to help you do the job.",

        "title": "Who Invented Windshield Wipers?",
        "content": "What Happened Before?\n\nPrior to this handy invention, people in some of the first cars had to contend with rain and snow in much more inconvenient ways. Drivers would have to stop every few minutes and manually wipe of the windshield themselves. Or, people simply wouldn\u2019t drive in such weather. Though car didn\u2019t become widely available until the introduction of Henry Ford\u2019s Model T in 1908, the first automobiles were built in 1885 by Germany\u2019s Karl Benz. It was 1902 when the idea of windshield wipers came to be.\n\nA Southerner\u2019s Visit to the Big Apple\n\nIn 1902, Mary Anderson, a Birmingham, Alabama, native, was on a trip to New York City. On one winter day, she was riding in a streetcar, stuck in traffic. Snow was falling, making it difficult for the driver to see. While the car was stopped, the driver got out and cleaned off the windshield. This happened over and over, causing Anderson to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t a more efficient way of removing snow. The snow impeded the driver\u2019s vision as it built up and the act of stopping to brush it off made the ride much longer. Anderson thought if there was some method of putting a blade on the car that could wipe away the snow, drivers wouldn\u2019t have to keep getting out of cars to clear their vantage point. The thoughts sparked an invention that would benefit every driver in the world.\n\nTo the Drawing Board\n\nWhen she got back to Alabama, Anderson went right to work with her idea. She drew a picture of this water-removing device and described how it would function. Anderson wasn\u2019t merely curious about this concept, nor was she just tinkering with a fanciful dream. She was so serious about it that she applied for a patent for the windshield wipers on June 18, 1903. With Anderson\u2019s device, the driver would work the wipers by using a handle inside the car. The exact language of the patent stated that the wipers would \u201cthus leaving nothing to mar the usual appearance of the car during fair weather.\u201d\n\nSuccess and Disappointment\n\nGood news came to Anderson on November 10, 1903, just five months after filing the patent. The U.S. patent office informed her that it had been accepted. She awarded patent number 743,801 for her \u201cWindow Cleaning Device.\u201d With this significant win in hand, Anderson was eager to market the device and get manufacturers to put it in cars. It certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt her financially, either, if a company were to purchase the idea from her. Unfortunately, no companies were interested in her new invention. She received a letter from one firm that said there was no commercial value in the device that would \u201cwarrant our undertaking of its sale.\u201d She continued to shop around her idea, but no one would accept. She was continuously rejected. Today, it seems easy to be confused by why no one would want to use her invention. Decades later, some of her descendants suggested that the fact she was a woman living in what was then a male-dominated business world had something to do with her inability to interest businesses.\n\nCatching On\n\nEventually, this windshield wiper inventor would see her creation make it into cars, even if it wasn\u2019t her original form. Other inventors such as James Henry Apjohn, John Oishei, and Charlotte Bridgwood filed patents for similar devices that would captivate the interest of the public and manufacturing companies. Fred and William Folberth came up with an automatic wiper that used a vacuum for power. This device was common on cars through the 1950s.\n\nIntermittent Wipers\n\nAnderson\u2019s invention got the ball rolling for other inventors and thinkers to come up with more advanced ways of removing water with windshield wipers. Engineering professor Robert Kearns, of Detroit, Michigan, used electronic components to build a wiper that moved every few seconds. He filed a patent in 1963 for his intermittent device. Kearns wanted the Ford Motor Company to manufacture and sell the device. Ford initially passed on the proposal but offered a similar wiper a few years later. Kearns wasn\u2019t pleased with this development and sued Ford in a patent dispute in 1978. He did the same with Chrysler four years later. He won a settlement in 1990, and a Supreme Court ruling upheld this decision in 1995.\n\nWipers Today\n\nWindshield wipers certainly have come a long way since their humble beginnings at the turn of the 20th century. The next time you\u2019re driving in a rainstorm or during a wintertime blizzard, you can remember the story of Mary Anderson and be thankful for her original design. Though others came after her to refine the concept, this Alabama woman is the pioneer who started it all.",

        "content": "How to change Windshield Wipers\n\n1. Remove the old blades\n\nMost blades will slide right off after pulling up on a clip on top of the wiper or pressing down on a small tab on the underside of the wiper. Your car manual or the new blades should have instructions showing where this latch is.\n\n2. Put on the new blades\n\nSlide the new blades on in the opposite way that the old ones came off. You will likely here a click when a tabbed blade locks into place. On blades with a clip, you may need to close the clip to lock the blade in place. When you\u2019re done, rest the wipers against the windshield again.\n\n3. Test the new blades\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to run the wipers a few times after putting them on, just to make sure they fit right, are working right, and are secure against the wiper arm.

        "title": "How Long Do Brake Pads Last?",
        "content": "Understanding Brake Pad Lifespan\n\nBrake pads are designed to generate friction when you press the brake pedal, and as they rub against the brake rotor, the softer compound the pad is made of has a microscopic layer that rubs away every time. The average lifespan can be under 20,000 miles or more than 60,000 miles for the front brakes, and much longer for the rears. And in that wide range, there are a variety of factors that determine how soon you\u2019ll need to change your brakes:\n\nDriving habits \u2013 How you drive plays a pivotal role in the lifespan of your brake pads. Aggressive driving and frequent abrupt stops can significantly accelerate wear and tear. Conversely, adopting a smoother and more gradual braking style contributes to an extended lifespan.\nMaterial composition \u2013 A range of materials are available for brake pads, each offering distinct characteristics impacting how long they last. Organic, semi-metallic, and ceramic pads are prevalent choices, and understanding their traits helps in making an informed selection.\nEnvironmental conditions \u2013 External elements such as weather and road conditions exert an influence on brake pad wear. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, as well as challenging terrains, can speed degradation.\nVehicle weight \u2013 The weight is a crucial determinant. Heavier vehicles tend to exert more force on the braking system, accelerating wear. You can expect mor frequent service intervals.\n\nHow to Identify Wear and Tear on Brake Pads\n\nRecognizing the telltale signs of wear on your brake pads is essential for the overall safety of your vehicle. Conducting regular visual inspections is an important aspect of brake pad maintenance. Checking for visible signs of wear, including measuring the pad thickness, allows for timely intervention when nearing the minimum limit. When the material is less than 4/32nds of an inch remaining at the thinnest part, change the pads.\nAn audible cue to potential issues, squeaking or grinding noises while braking often indicate worn-out brake pads. Addressing these warnings promptly can prevent further damage to other brake components. Any noticeable decrease in braking efficiency or an increase in stopping distance should serve as a clear indicator that your brake pads require attention.\nMany modern vehicles are equipped with electronic wear indicators. Monitoring the warning lights on your dashboard can provide an early indication of impending brake pad replacement.\n\nMaximizing Brake Pad Durability\n\nAdopting proactive measures for brake pad maintenance is essential to extend their lifespan and ensure optimal performance.\n\nRoutine visual inspections should become a habit for every car owner. Identifying and addressing issues promptly can prevent further damage and reduce the overall cost of maintenance.\nEmbracing a smooth and gradual braking style is not only safer but also contributes to reducing unnecessary wear on your brake pads. This practice is particularly beneficial for city driving and daily commuting.\nThe importance of using high-quality brake fluid cannot be overstated. Opting for a reputable brake fluid brand helps maintain the efficiency of your entire braking system, including the brake pads.\nPeriodically lubricating the contact points between the brake pads and calipers can prevent unnecessary friction, reducing wear and noise.\nUse cruise control for a consistent speed, helping to reduce brake applications to correct your speed.\n\nChoosing the Right Brake Pads for Your Driving Style\n\nSelecting the appropriate brake pads based on your driving habits and conditions is a pivotal decision that directly impacts their lifespan and performance.\n\nFor city driving and daily commuting, ceramic brake pads may be a suitable choice due to their quieter operation and lower dust production. They offer a balance between performance and comfort.\nEnthusiastic drivers or those engaging in performance driving might find semi-metallic brake pads to be the optimal choice. These pads offer enhanced stopping power, catering to more demanding driving conditions.\nFor passenger car owners who are budget-conscious, consider organic brake pads that are quiet and easy to apply but might not last quite as long as other options.\nIf your driving routine involves frequent towing or carrying heavy loads, considering heavy-duty or semi-metallic brake pads becomes imperative. These pads are designed to withstand the additional stress associated with such activities.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

Removing the alternator usually requires removal of the serpentine or accessory belt and the lifespan of most modern serpentine belts is much less than the lifespan of the vehicle\u2019s alternator. 60,000 to 100,000 miles is typically the most you can get out of a belt, while an alternator may last 150,000 or more miles without complaint. If you\u2019ve never replaced your serpentine belt, you should definitely do so when servicing the alternator.\u00a0\nA major factor on the longevity of your alternator is maintaining proper tension on the pulley from the serpentine belt. If there is too much tension on the alternator pulley, it can lead to damaged rotor shaft bearings. If there is not enough tension, the belt can slip, and it will cause your alternator to produce inconsistent power. The tensioner pulley is responsible for keeping the appropriate level of tension on all the pulleys that the serpentine belt drives and it is also a wear item.

How do you determine the quality of an alternator? Your first clue should be the type of warranty that the alternator carries. If an alternator comes with a limited lifetime warranty, it indicates that the manufacturer has done its homework and completed quality testing on the unit so that it meets a set of requirements for lifespan. If the manufacturer provides testing information, you should check to see if the individual components of the alternator were tested before assembly and then the completed alternator was tested at the end of assembly. This indicates that the parts and the whole unit all function as intended.\u00a0\nThe two items on your alternator that will tend to wear out the quickest will be the brushes and the bearings. It\u2019s impossible to see the brushes, unless you open the housing of the alternator to look inside, but you can check the bearings without any tools. Just hold the alternator with one hand while spinning the pulley with the other. That will indicate how freely the bearings are spinning. A new alternator should have very smooth bearings.

Alternators built for heavy-duty applications like highway trucks or machinery, will tend to be larger and heavier and can weigh anywhere from 16-50lbs, and even up to 100lbs or more for the beefiest models.\u00a0\nIf alternators are made of aluminum partly to save weight, why do alternators weigh so much for their small size? It\u2019s because the guts of an alternator contain extensive windings of copper wire in the rotor and the stator. Copper is a fairly dense metal, so the wires that make up the windings end up weighing a fair bit and making up most of the weight in the alternator.",

        "content": "Understanding the Cold-Weather Challenge\nVehicles can be a safe haven from the cold, but they don\u2019t always work their best below the freezing mark. Weatherstrips made of rubber firm up and add resistance when you\u2019re trying to close the door, plus they can allow cold air, moisture, and even snow to get inside. But that\u2019s not it.\nAs everyone learned in science class, water expands when it dips to the freezing point. Moisture takes up the limited space, particularly in parts that are meant to move, causing additional friction. Even more problematic, water droplets combined with cold air freeze and get in the way of moving parts such as door latches.\nIn addition, lubricants in some parts can get firm, which is often the case with power door lock actuators as well as door latches. They don\u2019t move as well as they used to, and where it should be causing smooth movement, it now has the opposite effect. The latch may not close on the striker, latch or lock rods might be stuck, or ice buildup in the weatherstrip could be too large of an obstruction for the latch to grab.\nAny of these conditions can contribute to a car door that won\u2019t latch in the cold.\nTroubleshooting the Frozen Latch\nTroubleshooting a frozen car door latch involves a systematic approach to identify and address the issue. Here\u2019s a step-by-step diagnosis flow:\n1. Confirm the Issue\nAttempt to open the door by pulling the handle from both the inside and outside. Check if the door feels unusually stiff or if there\u2019s any resistance when trying to open it. If there\u2019s no resistance in the handle, it\u2019s likely the latch is stuck in the open position.\n2. Inspect for Ice Buildup\nVisually inspect the door latch and surrounding areas for any visible ice accumulation. Pay attention to the edges of the door, the latch mechanism, and the area around the door frame.\n3. De-ice the Door Lock\nIf the issue seems to be with the lock, use a de-icing spray or a lock de-icer on the key. Insert the key into the lock and turn it gently to distribute the de-icer. You\u2019ll likely need to use de-icer several times to melt the obstruction.\n4. Check the Weather Stripping\nInspect the rubber weather stripping around the door for any signs of damage or stiffness. If the weather stripping is damaged, consider replacing it. Feel the weatherstripping to determine if there\u2019s a section filled with ice that\u2019s preventing the door from fully closing.\n5. Apply Lubricant to the Latch Mechanism\nUse a silicone-based lubricant on the latch mechanism and moving parts. Apply the lubricant generously, especially in areas prone to freezing like where the latch engages with the striker.\n6. Warm the Door\nIf possible, use a hair dryer, heat gun, or warm water to gently heat the frozen areas of the door, including the latch and surrounding components. Be cautious not to overheat or damage the paint.\n7. Operate the Door Handle\nAfter applying de-icer, lubricant, and warmth, attempt to open the door again by pulling the handle. If the door doesn\u2019t open, try applying gentle pressure to the door while pulling the handle.\n8. Inspect for Mechanical Issues\nIf the door still does not open, there might be a mechanical issue with the latch mechanism. Press the catch on the latch\u2013 the \u2018jaws\u2019 that grab the door striker \u2013 with a screwdriver, to see if it will spring back when you release it.\nCommon culprits can include ice in the door latch or lock cylinder or a chunk of ice between the door and the weatherstrip or frame. Since water tends to find its way into places easily, it could be something else \u2013 even a bent hinge.\nPreventative Maintenance for Winter-Ready Doors\nThe best way to deal with a car door that won\u2019t latch in the cold is to prevent it in the first place. Just like changing engine oil, your door seals and latches require preventative maintenance.\n\nAfter washing your car, summer or winter, spray your door latches with a silicone-based spray that displaces water and doesn\u2019t thicken or freeze in cold temperatures.\nSpray lock de-icer in all of the door locks regularly to displace any moisture that might enter.\u00a0\nLubricate the door hinges and check straps to ensure they don\u2019t bind when you\u2019re trying to close the door.\n\nEssential Tools and Products for Cold-Weather Car Care\nCar care in the winter requires a unique set of products and tools to ensure your car operates well, no matter how cold it gets outside. You should have:\n\nA snow brush and ice scraper to keep your windows unobstructed\nDe-icer spray for locks and glass\nLock de-icer to treat your lock cylinders\nWinter-rated windshield washer fluid\nSilicone-based lubricant spray\nWindshield cover\n\nWhen you\u2019re purchasing parts and supplies for your vehicle, quality matters. Choose products that are rated for cold temperatures and have excellent reviews from other customers. Using the right part or product for the job will make it go easier, last longer, and help prevent something from breaking.\n\nFAQ/People Also Ask",

The slip indicator light will come on briefly when it\u2019s working. If there is a failure at any point in this system, the indicator light will stay on. Common problems include bad wheel sensors, bad wiring, or a failing ABS control unit.",

        "content": "The EPS warning light looks like a steering wheel with an exclamation mark next to it. EPS car power steering uses an electric motor to help turn the steering rack. It has sensors that determine how much force you\u2019re using to turn the wheel. It pairs this with vehicle speed information to determine how much assist to provide. If something doesn\u2019t line up when the computer collects this information, it will turn on the warning light. Often, you can fix the problem by pulling off the road, shutting the car off, and letting it sit for a minute. When you turn the car back on, the system will reset itself. If it doesn\u2019t, you need to have the steering system inspected as soon as possible.",

        "content": "Vehicle Stability Assist uses the traction control system to reduce understeer and oversteer. When the system is working, it\u2019s normal for the VSA light to flicker on and off. The light will stay on if you turn the system off, or there\u2019s something keeping it from working. This could be due to a bad sensor, but most problems stem from having the wrong tires. If you buy new tires that are too small or large, the wheel speed won\u2019t match up with the engine speed. This keeps the VSA from accurately measuring slip, so it can\u2019t counteract steering problems.",

        "content": "In most cases, if your car shakes at idle, but runs fine otherwise, you have problems with idle air control. Older cars use an idle air control valve to send air around the throttle when it\u2019s closed. Over time, it can clog or stop moving, so your engine doesn\u2019t get the air it needs. Newer cars with a throttle-by-wire system open the throttle enough to keep the engine running. If the throttle position sensor is bad, the ECU can\u2019t adjust the throttle to keep up with air demand.\nIf the car shakes when AC is on or shakes more, it\u2019s due to the load the air conditioner compressor puts on the engine. This makes issues with idle air control more noticeable, since the engine needs more air to keep running.",

        "content": "If you\u2019ve ever driven a car with manual steering, you know it takes a lot more effort to turn the wheel at low speeds than it does when you\u2019re moving. Speed sensing steering adjusts assistance automatically based on driving conditions, so you can use the same amount of effort to steer the car at all speeds. The system measuring vehicle speed and the amount of force you\u2019re applying to the steering wheel. It uses this information to adjust the amount of power sent to the electric motor in your power steering system, balancing steering effort.",

It uses cameras and sensors to detect objects around your vehicle that you may not be able to see, so you can avoid them. Often, this warning pops up when one of the sensors is dirty, preventing it from sensing objects. The service warning also appears if a sensor or the wiring to it is damaged. Did you just hook up a trailer? The system may think something is wrong, because the rear sensors are constantly detecting an object nearby. However, some systems can detect this, and will display \u201cParking System Blocked\u201d instead of \u201cService Parking System.\u201d",

If you\u2019re using an OBD scanner, this shows up as code P0171 for bank 1, and code P0174 for bank 2. There are several possible causes:\n\nThere is a leak between the MAF or MAP sensor and the rest of the intake, giving the ECU a false air reading. This is usually caused by a loose clamp or a disconnected hose to the intake.\nThe injectors aren\u2019t spraying enough fuel. This could be caused by clogged injectors or low fuel pressure caused by a bad fuel pump or clogged fuel filter.\nThe O2 sensors are bad, giving the ECU a false reading.",

The check engine light flashing when accelerating combined with white exhaust appearing and disappearing suggests a sticking fuel injector.\nIf an injector doesn\u2019t want to close once it\u2019s opened when you accelerate, it dumps way more fuel than needed into the cylinder. Unburnt fuel exits the exhaust, showing up as white smoke. This unburnt fuel can also overload the catalytic converter, causing it to melt. After a while, the injector may close, bringing the air/fuel mixture back to normal. Of course, this is just one possibility. Have your car inspected by a mechanic as soon as possible.",

        "content": "If your car shudders when accelerating, then you may not want to drive your car until you figure out the issue. Your wheels and axles could be damaged the more that you drive.\nThe source of the problem could be from tires that are not balanced or a worn-out spark plug. It could also be loose lug nuts. \nA car also vibrates for a number of reasons when you accelerate. Typically it\u2019s from a damaged inner CV joint. These are located on the end of each axle. They both have an inner and outer joint that could be damaged and shake when you press the gas pedal.\nAnother cause could be a broken motor mount. If this part is damaged you can feel a vibration when idle but will increase when you begin to accelerate. \nA common issue is unbalanced tires. When your tires are unbalanced or even bubbled, you could also experience shaking when you accelerate.\nIt could be a bent axle or driveshaft. The driveshaft also connects the engine to the wheels and axles of the rear wheels. When you accelerate at a slower speed, the car may shake if the driveshaft has been damage or bent. This will get even worse if you accelerate at a faster rate.\nA stuck brake caliper, or even loose lug nuts can cause this issue. \nYou have to be careful when driving if you notice your car is shaking. Get it checked out immediately.",
